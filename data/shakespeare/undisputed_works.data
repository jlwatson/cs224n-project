("I am the most unfortunate in that game That ever pleased both genders, I ne'er played yet Under a bastard; the poor wenches curse me To the pit where'er I come; they were ne'er served so, But used to have more words than one to a bargain. I have such a fatal finger in such business I must forth with't, chiefly for country wenches, For every harvest I shall hinder hay-making; I had no less than seven lay in last progress, Within three weeks of one another's time. O Snaphance, have I found you? How Snaphance? Do you see your workmanship? Nay, turn not from it, nor offer to escape, for if you do, I'll cry it through the streets, and follow you. Your name may well be called Touchwood, a pox on you, You do but touch and take; thou hast undone me; I was a maid before, I can bring a certificate for it, From both the churchwardens. I'll have the parson's hand, too, or I'll not yield to't. Thou shalt have more, thou villain; nothing grieves me, but Ellen, my poor cousin in Derbyshire, thou hast cracked her marriage quite; she'll have a bout with thee. Faith, when she will I'll have a bout with her. A law bout, sir, I mean. True, lawyers use such bouts as other men do, And if that be all thy grief, I'll tender her a husband; I keep of purpose two or three gulls in pickle To eat such mutton with, and she shall choose one. Do but in courtesy, faith, wench, excuse me Of this half yard of flesh, in which I think it wants A nail or two.", 4, 6)
("She says I am not fair, that I lack manners; She calls me proud, and that she could not love me, Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will! Her love is not the hare that I do hunt: Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well, This is a letter of your own device. No, I protest, I know not the contents: Phebe did write it. Come, come, you are a fool And turn'd into the extremity of love. I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand. A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands: She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter: I say she never did invent this letter; This is a man's invention and his hand. Sure, it is hers. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style. A style for-challengers; why, she defies me, Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter? So please you, for I never heard it yet; Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes. Art thou god to shepherd turn'd, That a maiden's heart hath burn'd? Can a woman rail thus? Call you this railing?", 0, 3)
("Come, sir. What else? Let's go. How cheer you, sir? Faith, like the moon, more bright, Decreas'd in body, but re-made in light; Here thou shalt share some of my brightness with me. By my faith, they're comfortable beams, sir. Come, Where have you spent the time now from my sight? I'm jealous of thy action. Push! I did but walk A turn or two in the garden. What made you there? Nothing but cropp'd a flower. Some woman's honour, I believe. Much about one, When both are pluck'd, their sweetness is soon gone. Prithee, be true to me. When did I fail? Yet I am ever doubtful that [you] sin. I do account the world but as my spoil, To adorn thee: My love is artificial to all others, But purity to thee. Dost thou want gold? Here, take this chain of pearl, supply thyself: Be thou but constant, firm, and just to me, Rich heirs shall want ere want come near to thee. Upon thy lip I seal sincerity. Was this your vow to me? Pox, what's a kiss to be quite rid of her?", 4, 16)
("I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet: The fellow has good judgment. Excellent. Guess at her years, I prithee. Madam, She was a widow,-- Widow! Charmian, hark. And I do think she's thirty. Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round? Round even to faultiness. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so. Her hair, what colour? Brown, madam: and her forehead As low as she would wish it. There's gold for thee. Thou must not take my former sharpness ill: I will employ thee back again; I find thee Most fit for business: go make thee ready; Our letters are prepared. A proper man. Indeed, he is so: I repent me much That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him, This creature's no such thing. Nothing, madam. The man hath seen some majesty, and should know. Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend, And serving you so long! I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian: But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me Where I will write. All may be well enough.", 0, 5)
("The offence is satisfied. Come, to the song; Begin, sir. The song; and he keeps time, shows several humours and moods: the boy in his pocket nims away Fitsgrave's jewel here, and exit. Not a whole month since you were entered, ladies? It is no affliction, gentlemen. I care not much, i'faith, if I write down to my father presently to send up my sister in all haste that I may place her here at this music-school. How like you your new prize? Pray, give me leave; I have not yet sufficiently admir'd her. My wits must not stand idle. 'Slife, he's in a sick trance! Would not be ill bestow'd; I affect none, But for my prey: such are their affections, I know it; how could drabs and cheaters live else? Then since the world rolls on dissimulation, I'll be the first dissembler. Prithee, love, comfort, choice, My only wish, in thee I am confin'd! Deny me anything, a slight chain of pearl? Nay, an't be but slight-- Being denied, I prize it slight; but given me by my love, Light shall not be so dear unto my eye, Mine eye unto the body, as the gift. How have I power to deny this to you, That command all? My fortunes are thy servants, And thou the mistress both of them and me. Gives her the chain. The truest that e'er breathed! To a gentleman That thus so long has so sincerely lov'd you", 4, 16)
("Nay, but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes, That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn, The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart, Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper, And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gipsy's lust. Look, where they come: Take but good note, and you shall see in him. The triple pillar of the world transform'd Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see. If it be love indeed, tell me how much. There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd. I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved. Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth. News, my good lord, from Rome. Grates me: the sum. Nay, hear them, Antony: Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this; Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that; Perform 't, or else we damn thee.' How, my love! Perchance! nay, and most like: You must not stay here longer, your dismission Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.", 0, 5)
("No, thou shalt find, villain It hath right shape, and all the nails it should have. Faith, I am poor; do a charitable deed, wench, I am a younger brother, and have nothing. Nothing! Thou hast too much, thou lying villain Unless thou wert more thankful. I have no dwelling, I brake up house but this morning; pray thee, pity me, I am a good fellow, faith, have been too kind To people of your gender; if I ha't Without my belly, none of your sex shall want it. There's tricks enough to rid thy hand on't, wench, Some rich man's porch, tomorrow before day, Or else anon i' the evening, twenty devices; Here's all I have, i'faith, take purse and all. Where I find manly dealings I am pitiful, This shall not trouble you. And I protest, wench, The next I'll keep myself. Soft, let it be got first. This is the fifth; if e'er I venture more Where I now go for a maid, may I ride for a whore. What shift she'll make now with this piece of flesh In this strict time of Lent, I cannot imagine; Flesh dare not peep abroad now; I have known This city now above this seven years, But I protest in better state of government I never knew it yet, nor ever heard of; There has been more religious wholesome laws In the half circle of a year erected", 4, 6)
("A double gladness hath refreshed my soul; One, that you live, and one, to see your fate Looks freshly howsoever poor in state. My father Fortunatus, and thus brave? 'Tis no wonder to see a man brave, but a wonder how he comes brave. Dear Andelocia and son Ampedo, And my poor servant Shadow, plume your spirits With light-winged mirth; for Fortunatus' hand Can now pour golden showers into their laps That sometimes scorned him for his want of gold. Boys, I am rich, and you shall ne'er be poor; Wear gold, spend gold, we all in gold will feed, Now is your father Fortunate indeed. Father, be not angry, if I set open the windows of my mind: I doubt for all your bragging, you'll prove like most of our gallants in Famagosta, that have a rich outside and a beggarly inside, and like mules wear gay trappings, and good velvet foot-cloths on their backs, yet champ on the iron bit of penury—I mean, want coin. You gild our ears with a talk of gold, but I pray dazzle our eyes with the majesty of it. First will I wake your senses with the sound Of gold's sweet music: tell me what you hear? Believe me, sir, I hear not any thing. Ha, ha, ha. 'Sheart, I thought as much; if I hear any jingling, but of the purse strings that go flip flap, flip flap, flip flap, would I were turned into a flip-flap, and sold to the butchers! Shadow, I'll try thine ears; hark, dost rattle? Yes, like three blue beans in a blue bladder, rattle bladder, rattle: your purse is like my belly, th' one's without money, th' other without meat.", 1, 0)

That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant, have not seen these two days. Go, look after. Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus! He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes It is a thing most precious. But for her, Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her, Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown To her desired Posthumus: gone she is To death or to dishonour; and my end Can make good use of either: she being down, I have the placing of the British crown. How now, my son! 'Tis certain she is fled. Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none Dare come about him. This night forestall him of the coming day! I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal, And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one The best she hath, and she, of all compounded, Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but Disdaining me and throwing favours on", 0, 9)

Our subjects, sir, Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself To show less sovereignty than they, must needs Appear unkinglike. So, sir: I desire of you A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven. Madam, all joy befal your grace! And you! My lords, you are appointed for that office; The due of honour in no point omit. So farewell, noble Lucius. Your hand, my lord. Receive it friendly; but from this time forth I wear it as your enemy. Sir, the event Is yet to name the winner: fare you well. Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords, Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness! He goes hence frowning: but it honours us That we have given him cause.

And all these named, Intending but one thing; which art our writers Used to obscure their art. Sir, so I told him— Because the simple idiot should not learn it, And make it vulgar. Was not all the knowledge Of the Aegyptians writ in mystic symbols?", 2, 4)

Must I go with this black fellow, Uncle? Yes, pretty coz, hence with him Balthazar. Sweet child, within few minutes I'll change thy fate And take thee hence, but set thee at heavens gate. Some keep aloof and watch this soldier I'll do't. What's to be done now? First to plant strong guard About the mother, then into some snare To hunt this spotted panther, and there kill him. What snares have we can hold him? Be that care mine. Dangers, like stars, in dark attempts best shine. The Lady Onaelia dresseth the stead of her commendations in the most courtly attire that words can be clothed with, from herself to you, by me. So Sir, and what disease troubles her now? The King's evil. And here she hath sent something to you, wrapped up in a white sheet, you need not fear to open it, 'tis no course. What's here? A letter minced into five morsels? What was she doing when thou camest from her? At her prick-song. So me thinks, for here's nothing but sol-re-me-fa-mi. What crotchet fills her head now, canst tell?

("Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech To give me ample satisfaction For these deep shames and great indignities. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him, That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out. But had he such a chain of thee or no? He had, my lord: and when he ran in here, These people saw the chain about his neck. Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine Heard you confess you had the chain of him After you first forswore it on the mart: And thereupon I drew my sword on you; And then you fled into this abbey here, From whence, I think, you are come by miracle. I never came within these abbey-walls, Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me: I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven! And this is false you burden me withal. Why, what an intricate impeach is this! I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup. If here you housed him, here he would have been; If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly: You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you? Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine. He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her. Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?

Stay, whilst within this grove we dwell, If my angelical and saint-like form Can win some amorous fool to wanton here, And taste the fruit of this alluring tree, Thus shall his saucy brows adornèd be, To make us laugh. It will be rare: adieu. Foul, hell-bred fiend, Virtue shall strive with you, If any be enamoured of thine eyes, Their love must needs beget deformities. Men are transformed to beasts, feasting with sin; But if in spite of thee their souls I win, To taste this fruit, though thou disguise their head, Their shapes shall be re-metamorphosèd.

O thy lips haue sworne To stay with Dido: canst thou take her hand? Thy Hand and mine haue plighted mutuall faith, Therefore vnkinde Æneas, must thou say, Then let me goe, and neuer say farewell. O Queene of Carthage, wert thou vgly blacke, Æneas could not choose but hold thee deare, Yet must he not gainsay the Gods behest. The Gods, what Gods be those that seeke my death? Wherein haue I offended Iupiter, That he should take Æneas from mine armes? O no, the Gods wey not what Louers doe, It is Æneas calles Æneas hence, And wofull Dido by these blubbred cheekes, By this right hand, and by our spousall rites, Desires Æneas to remaine with her: Si bene quid de te merui, fuit aut tibi quidquam Dulce meum, miserere domus labentis: & istam Oro, si quis ad hac precibus locus, exue mentem. Desine meque tuis incendere teque querelis, Italiam non sponte sequor. Hast thou forgot how many neighbour kings Were vp in armes, for making thee my loue? How Carthage did rebell, Iarbus storme, And all the world calles me a second Helen, For being intangled by a strangers lookes: So thou wouldst proue as true as Paris did, Would, as faire Troy was, Carthage might be sackt, And I be calde a second Helena. Had I a sonne by thee, the griefe were lesse, That I might see Æneas in his face: Now if thou goest, what canst thou leaue behind, But rather will augment then ease my woe? In vaine my loue thou spendst thy fainting breath, If words might moue me I were ouercome. And wilt thou not be mou'd with Didos words? Thy mother was no Goddesse periurd man, Nor Dardanus the author of thy stocke: But thou art Sprung from Scythian Caucasus, And Tygers of Hircania gaue thee sucke: Ah foolish Dido to forbeare this long! Wast thou not wrackt vpon this Libian shoare, And cam'st to Dido like a Fisherswaine? Repairde not I thy ships, made thee a King, And all thy needie followers Noblemen? O Serpent that came creeping from the shoare, And I for pitie harbord in my bosome, Wilt thou now slay me with thy venomed sting, And hisse at Dido for preseruing thee? Goe goe and spare not, seeke out Italy, I hope that that which loue forbids me doe, The Rockes and Sea-gulfes will performe at large, And thou shalt perish in the billowes waies, To whom poore Dido doth bequeath reuenge, I traytor, and the waues shall cast thee vp, Where thou and false Achates first set foote: Which if it chaunce, Ile giue ye buriall, And weepe vpon your liueles carcases, Though thou nor he will pitie me a whit.

I but heele come againe, he cannot goe, He loues me to too well to serue me so: Yet he that in my sight would not relent, Will, being absent, be abdurate still. By this is he got to the water side, And, see the Sailers take him by the hand, But he shrinkes backe, and now remembring me, Returnes amaine: welcome, welcome my loue: But wheres Æneas? ah hees gone hees gone! What meanes my sister thus to raue and crye? O Anna, my Æneas is abourd, And leauing me will saile to Italy. Once didst thou goe, and he came backe againe, Now bring him backe, and thou shalt be a Queene, And I will liue a priuate life with him. Wicked Æneas. Call him not wicked, sister speake him faire, And looke vpon him with a Mermaides eye, Tell him, I neuer vow'd at Aulis gulfe The desolation of his natiue Troy, Nor sent a thousand ships vnto the walles, Nor euer violated faith to him: Request him gently (Anna) to returne, I craue but this, he stay a tide or two, That I may learne to beare it patiently, If he depart thus suddenly, I dye: Run Anna, run, stay not to answere me.

O Anna, Anna, I will follow him. How can ye goe when he hath all your fleete? Ile frame me wings of waxe like Icarus, And ore his ships will soare vnto the Sunne, That they may melt and I fall in his armes: Or els Ile make a prayer vnto the waues, That I may swim to him like Tritons neece: O Anna, fetch Orions Harpe, That I may tice a Dolphin to the shoare, And ride vpon his backe vnto my loue: Looke sister, looke louely Æneas ships, See see, the billowes heaue him vp to heauen, And now downe falles the keeles into the deepe: O sister, sister, take away the Rockes, Theile breake his ships, O Proteus, Neptune, Ioue, Saue, saue Æneas, Didos leefest loue! Now is he come on shoare safe without hurt: But see, Achates wils him put to sea, And all the Sailers merrie make for ioy, But he remembring me shrinkes backe againe: See where he comes, welcome, welcome my loue. Ah sister, leaue these idle fantasies, Sweet sister cease, remember who you are. Dido I am, vnlesse I be deceiu'd, And must I raue thus for a renegate? Must I make ships for him to saile away? Nothing can beare me to him but a ship, And he hath all thy fleete, what shall I doe? But dye in furie of this ouersight? I, I must be the murderer of my selfe: No but I am not, yet I will be straight. Anna be glad, now haue I found a meane To rid me from these thoughts of Lunacie: Not farre from hence there is a woman famoused for arts, Daughter vnto the Nimphs Hesperides, Who wild me sacrifice his ticing relliques: Goe Anna, bid my seruants bring me fire. Exit Anna. How long will Dido mourne a strangers flight, That hath dishonord her and Carthage both? How long shall I with griefe consume my daies, And reape no guerdon for my truest loue? Iarbus, talk not of Æneas, let him goe, Lay to thy hands and helpe me make a fire, That shall consume all that this stranger left, For I entend a priuate Sacrifize, To cure my minde that melts for vnkind loue. But afterwards will Dido graunt me loue? I, I, Iarbus, after this is done, None in the world shall have my loue but thou: So, leaue me now, let none approach this place. Exit Iarbus. Now Dido, with these reliques burne thy selfe, And make Æneas famous through the world, For periurie and slaughter of a Queene: Here lye the Sword that in the darksome Caue He drew, and swore by to be true to me, Thou shalt burne first, thy crime is worse then his: Here lye the garment which I cloath'd him in, When first he came on shoare, perish thou to: These letters, lines, and periurd papers all, Shall burne to cinders in this prectious flame. And now ye Gods that guide the starrie frame, And order all things at your high dispose; Graunt, though the traytors land in Italy, They may be still tormented with vnrest, And from mine ashes let a Conquerour rise, That may reuenge this treason to a Queene, By plowing vp his Countries with the Sword: Betwixt this land and that be neuer league, Littora littoribus contraria, fluctibus undas Impresor: arma armis: pugnent ipsig nepotes: Liue false Æneas, truest Dido dyes, Sic sic inuat ire sub umbras. O helpe Iarbus, Dido in these flames Hath burnt her selfe, aye me, vnhappie me! Cursed Iarbus, dye to expiate The griefe that tires vpon thine inward soule, Dido I come to thee, aye me Æneas. What can my teares or cryes preuaile me now? Dido is dead, Iarbus slaine, Iarbus my deare loue, O sweet Iarbus, Annas sole delight, What fatall destinie enuies me thus, To see my sweet Iarbus slay himselfe?

A wofull tale bids Dido to vnfould, Whose memorie like pale deaths stony mace, Beates forth my senses from this troubled soule, And makes Æneas sinke at Didos feete. What faints Æneas to remember Troy? In whose defence he fought so valiantly: Looke vp and speake. Then speake Æneas with Achilles tongue, And Dido and you Carthaginian Peeres Heare me, but yet with Mirmidons harsh eares, Daily inur'd to broyles and Massacres, Lest you be mou'd too much with my sad tale. The Grecian souldiers tired with ten yeares warre; Began to crye, let vs vnto our ships, Troy is inuincible, why stay we here? With whose outcryes Atrides being apal'd, Summoned the Captaines to his princely tent, Who looking on the scarres we Troians gaue, Seeing the number of their men decreast, And the remainder weake and out of heart, Gaue vp their voyces to dislodge the Campe, And so in troopes all marcht to Tenedos: Where when they came, Vlysses on the sand Assayd with honey words to turne them backe: And as he spoke to further his entent, The windes did driue huge billowes to the shoare, And heauen was darkned with tempestuous clowdes: Then he alleag'd the Gods would haue them stay, And prophecied Troy should be ouercome: And therewithall he calde false Sinon forth, A man compact of craft and periurie, Whose ticing tongue was made of Hermes pipe, To force an hundred watchfull eyes to sleepe: And him Epeus hauing made the horse, With sacrificing wreathes vpon his head, Vlysses sent to our vnhappie towne: Who groueling in the mire of Zanthus bankes, His hands bound at his back, and both his eyes Turnd vp to heauen as one resolu'd to dye, Our Phrigian shepherd haled within the gates, And brought vnto the Court of Priamus: To whom he vsed action so pitifull, Lookes so remorcefull, vowes so forcible, As therewithall the old man ouercome, Kist him, imbrast him, and vnloosde his bands, And then, O Dido pardon me. Nay leaue not here, resolue me of the rest. O th'inchaunting words of that base slaue, Made him to thinke Epeus pine-tree Horse A sacrifize t'appease Mineruas wrath: The rather for that one Laocoon Breaking a speare vpon his hollow breast, Was with two winged Serpents stung to death. Whereat agast, we were commanded straight With reuerence to draw it into Troy. In which vnhappie worke was I employd, These hands did helpe to hale it to the gates, Through which it could not enter twas so huge. O had it neuer entred, Troy had stood. But Priamus impatient of delay, Inforst a wide breach in that rampierd wall, Which thousand battering Rams could neuer pierce, And so came in this fatall instrument: At whose accursed feete as ouerioyed, We banquetted till ouercome with wine, Some surfetted, and others soundly slept. Which Sinon viewing, causde the Greekish spyes To hast to Tenedos and tell the Campe: Then he vnlockt the Horse, and suddenly From out his entrailes, Neoptolemus Setting his speare vpon the ground, leapt forth, And after him a thousand Grecians more, In whose sterne faces shin'd the quenchles fire, That after burnt the pride of Asia. By this the Campe was come vnto the walles, And through the breach did march into the streetes, Where meeting with the rest, kill kill they cryed. Frighted with this confused noyse, I rose, And looking from a turret, might behold Yong infants swimming in their parents bloud, Headles carkasses piled vp in heapes, Virgins halfe dead dragged by their golden haire, And with maine force flung on a ring of pikes, Old men with swords thrust through their aged sides, Kneeling for mercie to a Greekish lad, Who with steele Pol-axes dasht out their braines. Then buckled I mine armour, drew my sword, And thinking to goe downe, came Hectors ghost With ashie visage, blewish, sulphure eyes, His armes torne from his shoulders, and his breast Furrowd with wounds, and that which made me weepe, Thongs at his heeles, by which Achilles horse Drew him in triumph through the Greekish Campe, Burst from the earth, crying, Æneas flye, Troy is a fire, the Grecians haue the towne, O Hector who weepes not to heare thy name? Yet flung I forth, and desperate of my life, Ran in the thickest throngs, and with this sword Sent many of their sauadge ghosts to hell. At last came Pirrhus fell and full of ire. His harnesse dropping bloud, and on his speare The mangled head of Priams yongest sonne, And after him his band of Mirmidons, With balles of wilde fire in their murdering pawes, Which made the funerall flame that burnt faire Troy: All which hemd me about, crying, this is he. Ah, how could poore Æneas scape their hands? My mother Venus iealous of my health, Conuaid me from their crooked nets and bands: So I escapt the furious Pirrhus wrath: Who then ran to the pallace of the King, And at Ioues Altar finding Priamus, About whose withered necke hung Hecuba, Foulding his hand in hers, and ioyntly both Beating their breasts and falling on the ground, He with his faulchions poynt raisde vp at once, And with Megeras eyes stared in their face, Threatning a thousand deaths at euery glaunce. To whom the aged King thus trembling spoke: Achilles sonne, remember what I was, Father of fiftie sonnes, but they are slaine, Lord of my fortune, but my fortunes turnd, King of this Citie, but my Troy is fired, And now am neither father, Lord, nor King: Yet who so wretched but desires to liue? O let me liue, great Neoptolemus, Not mou'd at all, but smiling at his teares, This butcher whil'st his hands were yet held vp, Treading vpon his breast, strooke off his hands. O end Æneas, I can heare no more. At which the franticke Queene leapt on his face, And in his eyelids hanging by the nayles, A little while prolong'd her husbands life: At last the souldiers puld her by the heeles, And swong her howling in the emptie ayre, Which sent an eccho to the wounded King: Whereat he lifted vp his bedred lims, And would haue grappeld with Achilles sonne, Forgetting both his want of strength and hands, Which he disdaining whiskt his sword about, And with the wound thereof the King fell downe: Then from the nauell to the throat at once, He ript old Priam: at whose latter gaspe Ioues marble statue gan to bend the brow, As lothing Pirrhus for this wicked act: Yet he vndaunted tooke his fathers flagge, And dipt it in the old Kings chill cold bloud, And then in triumph ran into the streetes, Through which he could not passe for slaughtred men: So leaning on his sword he stood stone still, Viewing the fire wherewith rich Ilion burnt. By this I got my father on my backe, This yong boy in mine armes, and by the hand Led faire Creusa my beloued wife, When thou Achates with thy sword mad'st way, And we were round inuiron'd with the Greekes: O there I lost my wife: and had not we Fought manfully, I had not told this tale: Yet manhood would not serue, of force we fled, And as we went vnto our ships, thou knowest We sawe Cassandra sprauling in the streetes, Whom Aiax rauisht in Dianas Fawne, Her cheekes swolne with sighes, her haire all rent, Whom I tooke vp to beare vnto our ships; But suddenly the Grecians followed vs, And I alas, was forst to let her lye. Then got we to our ships, and being abourd, Polixena cryed out, Æneas stay, The Greekes pursue me, stay and take me in. Moued with her voyce, I lept into the sea, Thinking to beare her on my backe abourd: For all our ships were launcht into the deepe, And as I swomme, she standing on the shoare, Was by the cruell Mirmidons surprizd, And after by that Pirrhus sacrifizde.

What length or bredth shal this braue towne c[=o]taine? Not past foure thousand paces at the most. But what shall it be calde, Troy as before? That haue I not determinde with my selfe.

Vaine man, what Monarky expectst thou here? Or with what thought sleepst thou in Libia shoare? If that all glorie hath forsaken thee, And thou despise the praise of such attempts: Yet thinke vpon Ascanius prophesie, And yong Iulus more then thousand yeares, Whom I haue brought from Ida where he slept, And bore yong Cupid vnto Cypresse Ile.

Eating sweet Comfites with Queene Didos maide, Who euer since hath luld me in her armes. Sergestus, beare him hence vnto our ships, Lest Dido spying him keepe him for a pledge. Spendst thou thy time about this little boy, And giuest not care vnto the charge I bring? I tell thee thou must straight to Italy, Or els abide the wrath of frowning Ioue. How should I put into the raging deepe, Who haue no sailes nor tackling for my ships? What would the Gods haue me Deucalion like, Flote vp and downe where ere the billowes driue? Though she repairde my fleete and gaue me ships, Yet hath she tane away my oares and masts, And left me neither saile nor sterne abourd. How now Æneas, sad, what meanes these dumpes? Iarbus, I am cleane besides my selfe, Ioue hath heapt on me such a desperate charge, Which neither art nor reason may atchieue, Nor I deuise by what meanes to contriue. As how I pray, may I entreat you tell. With speede he bids me sail to Italy. When as I want both rigging for my fleete, And also furniture for these my men. If that be all, then cheare thy drooping lookes, For I will furnish thee with such supplies: Let some of those thy followers goe with me, And they shall haue what thing so ere thou needst. Thankes good Iarbus for thy friendly ayde, Achates and the rest shall waite on thee, Whil'st I rest thankfull for this curtesie.

I feare I sawe Æneas little sonne, Led by Achates to the Troian fleete: If it be so, his father meanes to flye: But here he is, now Dido trie thy wit. Æneas, wherefore goe thy men abourd?, Why are thy ships new rigd? or to what end Launcht from the hauen, lye they in the Rhode? Pardon me though I aske, loue makes me aske. O pardon me, if I resolue thee why: Æneas will not faine with his deare loue, I must from hence: this day swift Mercury When I was laying a platforme for these walles, Sent from his father Ioue, appeard to me, And in his name rebukt me bitterly, For lingering here, neglecting Italy. But yet Æneas will not leaue his loue. I am commaunded by immortal Ioue, To leaue this towne and passe to Italy, And therefore must of force. These words proceed not from Æneas heart. Not from my heart, for I can hardly goe, And yet I may not stay, Dido farewell. Farewell: is this the mends for Didos loue? Doe Troians vse to quit their Louers thus?

That year, indeed, he was troubled with a rheum; What willingly he did confound he wail'd, Believe't, till I wept too. No, sweet Octavia, You shall hear from me still; the time shall not Out-go my thinking on you. Come, sir, come; I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love: Look, here I have you; thus I let you go, And give you to the gods. Adieu; be happy! Let all the number of the stars give light To thy fair way! Farewell, farewell! Farewell! Where is the fellow? Half afeard to come. Go to, go to. Come hither, sir. Good majesty,", 0, 5)
("Some, of violated vows 'Twixt the souls of friend and friend: But upon the fairest boughs, Or at every sentence end, Will I Rosalinda write, Teaching all that read to know The quintessence of every sprite Heaven would in little show. Therefore Heaven Nature charged That one body should be fill'd With all graces wide-enlarged: Nature presently distill'd Helen's cheek, but not her heart, Cleopatra's majesty, Atalanta's better part, Sad Lucretia's modesty. Thus Rosalind of many parts By heavenly synod was devised, Of many faces, eyes and hearts, To have the touches dearest prized. Heaven would that she these gifts should have, And I to live and die her slave. O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have patience, good people!' How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little. Go with him, sirrah. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat; though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage. Didst thou hear these verses?", 0, 3)
("Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath a wherefore. Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore-- For urging it the second time to me. Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season, When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason? Well, sir, I thank you. Thank me, sir, for what? Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing. I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time? No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have. In good time, sir; what's that? Basting. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry. If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it. Your reason? Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a time for all things. I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric. By what rule, sir? Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father Time himself. Let's hear it. There's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature. May he not do it by fine and recovery?", 0, 7)
("So fare thou well. Our pen shall honour thee. The poet's book Madam, has got the inflammation of the liver, it died of a burning fever. What shall I do, Cornego? For this poet Has filled me with a fury. I could write Strange satires now against adulterers, And marriage-breakers. I believe you Madam - but here comes your uncle. Where's our niece? Turn your brains round, and recollect your spirits, And see your noble friends and kinsmen ready To pay revenge his due. That word revenge, Startles my sleepy soul, now thoroughly wakened By the fresh object of my hapless child Whose wrongs reach beyond mine. How doth my sweet mother? How doth my prettiest boy? Wrongs, like great whirlwinds, Shake highest battlements. Few for heaven would care, Should they be ever happy. They are half gods Who both in good days, and good fortune share. I have no part in either. You shall in both, Can swords but cut the way. I care not much, so you but gently strike him, And that my child escape the lightening. For that our nerves are knit; is there not here A promising face of manly princely virtues,", 1, 2)
("To Italy, sweete friends to Italy, We will not stay a minute longer here. Troians abourd, and I will follow you, I faine would goe, yet beautie calles me backe: To leaue her so and not once say farewell, Were to transgresse against all lawes of loue: But if I vse such ceremonious thankes, As parting friends accustome on the shoare, Her siluer armes will coll me round about, And teares of pearle, crye stay, Æneas, stay: Each word she sayes will then containe a Crowne, And euery speech be ended with a kisse: I may not dure this female drudgerie, To sea Æneas, finde out Italy. Exit. O Anna, runne vnto the water side, They say Æneas men are going abourd, It may be he will steale away with them: Stay not to answere me, runne Anna runne. O foolish Troians that would steale from hence, And not let Dido vnderstand their drift: I would haue giuen Achates store of gold, And Illioneus gum and Libian spice, The common souldiers rich imbrodered coates, And siluer whistles to controule the windes, Which Circes sent Sicheus when he liued: Vnworthie are they of a Queenes reward: See where they come, how might I doe to chide? Twas time to runne, Æneas had been gone, The sailes were hoysing vp, and he abourd. Is this thy loue to me? O princely Dido, giue me leaue to speake, I went to take my farewell Achates. How haps Achates bid me not farewell? Because I feard your grace would keepe me here. To rid thee of that doubt, abourd againe, I charge thee put to sea and stay not here. Then let Æneas goe abourd with vs. Get you abourd, Æneas meanes to stay. The sea is rough, the windes blow to the shoare. O false Æneas, now the sea is rough, But when you were abourd twas calme enough, Thou and Achates ment to saile away. Hath not the Carthage Queene mine onely sonne? Thinkes Dido I will goe and leaue him here? Æneas pardon me, for I forgot That yong Ascanius lay with me this night: Loue made me iealous, but to make amends, Weare the emperiall Crowne of Libia, Sway thou the Punike Scepter in my steede, And punish me Æneas for this crime. This kisse shall be faire Didos punishment. O how a Crowne becomes Æneas head! Stay here Æneas, and commaund as King. Æn. How vaine am I to weare this Diadem, And beare this golden Scepter in my hand? A Burgonet of steele, and not a Crowne, A Sword, and not a Scepter fits Æneas. O keepe them still, and let me gaze my fill: Now lookes Æneas like immortall Ioue, O where is Ganimed to hold his cup, And Mercury to flye for what he calles, Ten thousand Cupids houer in the ayre, And fanne it in Æneas louely face, O that the Clowdes were here wherein thou fleest, That thou and I vnseene might sport our selues: Heauens enuious of our ioyes is waxen pale, And when we whisper, then the starres fall downe, To be partakers of our honey talke. O Dido, patronesse of all our liues, When I leaue thee, death be my punishment, Swell raging seas, frowne wayward destinies, Blow windes, threaten ye Rockes and sandie shelfes, This is the harbour that Æneas seekes, Lets see what tempests can anoy me now. Not all the world can take thee from mine armes, Æneas may commaund as many Moores, As in the Sea are little water drops: And now to make experience of my loue, Faire sister Anna leade my louer forth, And seated on my Gennet, let him ride As Didos husband through the punicke streetes, And will my guard with Mauritanian darts, To waite vpon him as their soueraigne Lord. What if the Citizens repine thereat? Those that dislike what Dido giues in charge, Commaund my guard to slay for their offence: Shall vulgar pesants storme at what I doe? The ground is mine that giues them sustenance, The ayre wherein they breathe, the water, fire, All that they haue, their lands, their goods, their liues, And I the Goddesse of all these, commaund Æneas ride as Carthaginian King. Æneas for his parentage deserues As large a kingdome as is Libia. I, and vnlesse the destinies be false, I shall be planted in as rich a land. Speake of no other land, this land is thine, Dido is thine, henceforth Ile call thee Lord: Doe as I bid thee, sister leade the way, And from a turret Ile behold my loue. Then here in me shall flourish Priams race, And thou and I Achates, for reuenge, For Troy, for Priam, for his fiftie sonnes, Our kinsmens loues, and thousand guiltles soules, Will leade an hoste against the hatefull Greekes, And fire proude Lacedemon ore their heads. Exit. Speakes not Æneas like a Conqueror? O blessed tempests that did driue him in, O happie sand that made him runne aground: Henceforth you shall be our Carthage Gods: I, but it may be he will leaue my loue, And seeke a forraine land calde Italy: O that I had a charme to keepe the windes Within the closure of a golden ball, Or that the Tyrrhen sea were in mine armes, That he might suffer shipwracke on my breast, As oft as he attempts to hoyst vp saile: I must preuent him, wishing will not serue: Goe, bid my Nurse take yong Ascanius, And beare him in the countrey to her house, Æneas will not goe without his sonne: Yet left he should, for I am full of feare, Bring me his oares, his tackling, and his sailes; What if I sinke his ships? O heele frowne. Better he frowne, then I should dye for griefe: I cannot see him frowne, it may not be: Armies of foes resolu'd to winne this towne, Or impious traitors vowde to haue my life, Affright me not, onely Æneas frowne Is that which terrifies poore Didos heart: Nor bloudie speares appearing in the ayre, Presage the downfall of my Emperie, Nor blazing Commets threatens Didos death, It is Æneas frowne that ends my daies: If he forsake me not, I neuer dye, For in his lookes I see eternitie, And heele make me immortall with a kisse. Your Nurse is gone with yong Ascanius, And heres Æneas tackling, oares and sailes. Are these the sailes that in despight of me, Packt with the windes to beare Æneas hence? Ile hang ye in the chamber where I lye, Driue if you can my house to Italy: Ile set the casement open that the windes May enter in, and once againe conspire Against the life of me poore Carthage Queene: But though he goe, he stayes in Carthage still, And let rich Carthage fleete vpon the seas, So I may haue Æneas in mine armes. Is this the wood that grew in Carthage plaines, And would be toyling in the watrie billowes, To rob their mistresse of her Troian guest? O cursed tree, hadst thou but wit or sense, To measure how I prize Æneas loue, Thou wouldst haue leapt from out the Sailers hands, And told me that Æneas ment to goe: And yet I blame thee not, thou art but wood. The water which our Poets terme a Nimph, Why did it suffer thee to touch her breast, And shrunke not backe, knowing my loue was there? The water is an Element, no Nimph, Why should I blame Æneas for his flight? O Dido, blame not him, but breake his oares, These were the instruments that launcht him forth, Theres not so much as this base tackling too, But dares to heape vp sorrowe to my heart: Was it not you that hoysed vp these sailes? Why burst you not, and they fell in the seas? For this will Dido tye ye full of knots, And sheere ye all asunder with her hands: Now serue to chastize shipboyes for their faults, Ye shall no more offend the Carthage Queene, Now let him hang my fauours on his masts, And see if those will serue in steed of sailes: For tackling, let him take the chaines of gold, Which I bestowd vpon his followers: In steed of oares, let him vse his hands, And swim to Italy, Ile keepe these sure: Come beare them in. Exit. My Lord Ascanius, ye must goe with me.", 5, 13)
