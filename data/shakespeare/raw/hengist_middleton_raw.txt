Enter Raynulph, a monk, the presenter.

RAYNULPH 
What Raynulph monk of Chester can 
Raise from his [Polychronicon], 
That raises him as works do men 
To see light so long parted with again, 
That best may please this round, fair ring 
With sparkling judgments [circled] in 
[I] shall produce; if all my powers 
Can win the grace of two poor hours, 
Well a-paid I go to rest. 
Ancient stories have been best. 
Fashions that are now call'd new 
Have been worn by more than you; 
Elder times have us'd the same, 
Though these new ones get the name: 
So in story what's now told 
That takes not part with days of old? 
Then to prove time's mutual glory 
Join new time's love to old time's story.

Exit.


I.i. [Before a monastery]
Shout. Enter Vortiger.

VORTIGER 
Will that wide-throated beast, the multitude, 
Never lin bellowing? Courtiers are ill-advis'd 
When they first make such monsters. 
How near was I to a sceptre and a crown! 
Fair power was e'en upon me; my desires 
Were tasting glory till this forked rabble 
With their infectious acclamations 
Poisoned my fortune. They will here have none 
As long as Constantine's three sons survive, 
As if vassals knew not how to obey 
But in that line, like their professions 
That all their lifetime hammer out one way, 
Beaten into their pates with seven years' bondage. 
Well, though I rise not king, I'll seek the means 
To grow as close to one as policy can, 
And choke their expectations.

Enter Devonshire, Stafford.

Now, [good] lords, 
In whose [kind] loves and wishes I am built 
As high as human dignity can aspire, 
Are yet those trunks that have no other souls 
But noise and ignorance something more quiet?

DEVONSHIRE 
Nor are they like to be for ought we gather. 
Their wills are up still: nothing will appease 'em; 
Good speeches are but cast away upon 'em.

VORTIGER 
Then, since necessity and fate withstand me, 
I'll strive to enter at a [straighter] passage. 
Your sudden aids and counsels, good my lords.

STAFFORD 
They're ours no longer than they do you service.

Music. Enter certain Monks [including Lupus and] Germanus, Constantius being one, singing as [at] precession[, and Aurelius and Uther]. Song.

[MONKS] 
Boast not of high birth or blood; 
To be great is to be good. 
Holy and religious things, 
Those are vestures fit for kings; 
By how much man in fame shines clearer, 
He to heaven should draw the nearer, 
He deserving best of praises 
Whom virtue raises. 
It is not state, it is not birth; 
The way to heaven is grace on earth. 
Sing to the temple him so holy 
Sin may blush to think on folly.
VORTIGER 
Vessels of sanctity, be pleas'd a while 
To give attention to the public peace, 
Wherein heaven is serv'd too, though not so purely: 
Constantius, eldest son of Constantine, 
We here seize on thee for the general good, 
And in thy right of birth.

CONSTANTIUS 
On me! For what, lords?

VORTIGER 
The kingdom's government.

CONSTANTIUS 
Oh, powers of blessedness! 
Keep me from [growing] downwards into earth again; 
I hope I am further on my way than so. 
[To Monks] Set forward.

VORTIGER 
You must not.

CONSTANTIUS 
How!

VORTIGER 
I know your wisdom 
Will light upon a way to pardon us 
When you shall read in every Briton's brow 
The urg'd necessity of the times.

CONSTANTIUS 
What necessity 
Can be i' th' world but prayer and repentance? 
And that business I am about.

[Shout.]

VORTIGER 
Hark, afar off still! 
We lose [and] hazard much. Holy Germanus 
And reverend Lupus, with all expedition 
Set the crown on him.

CONSTANTIUS 
No such mark of fortune 
Comes near my head.

VORTIGER 
My lord, we are forc'd to rule you.

CONSTANTIUS 
Dare you receive heaven's light in at your eyelids 
And offer violence to religion? Take heed, 
The very beam let in to comfort you 
May be the fire to burn you; on these knees, 
Hardened with zealous prayers, I entreat you 
Bring not my cares into the world again. 
Think with how much unwillingness and anguish 
A glorified soul parted from the body 
Would to that loathsome [gaol] return again; 
With such great pain a well subdued affection 
Reenters worldly business.

VORTIGER 
Good my lord, 
I know you cannot lodge so many virtues, 
But patience must be one. As low as earth 
We beg the freeness of your own consent, 
Which else must be constrain'd, and time it were 
Either agreed or forc'd. Speak, good my lord, 
For you bind up more sin in this delay 
Than thousand prayers can absolve again.

CONSTANTIUS 
Were 't but my death, you should not kneel so long for't.

VORTIGER 
'Twill be the death of millions if you rise not, 
And that betimes too. Lend your helps, my lords, 
For fear all come too late.

CONSTANTIUS 
This is a cruelty 
That peaceful man did never suffer yet, 
To make me die again that was once dead, 
And begin all that ended long before. 
Hold, Lupus and Germanus, you are lights 
Of holiness and religion. Can you offer 
The thing that is not lawful? Stand not I 
Clear from all temporal charge by my profession?

GERMANUS 
Not when a time so violent calls upon you. 
Who's born a prince is born [for] general peace, 
Not his [own] only; heaven will look for him 
In others' business and require him there. 
What is in you religious must be shown 
In saving many more souls than your own.

CONSTANTIUS 
Did not great Constantine, our noble father, 
Deem me unfit for government and rule, 
And therefore [pressed] me into this profession, 
Which I have held strict and love it above glory? 
Nor is there want in me; yourselves can witness 
Heaven has provided largely for your peace 
And bless'd you with the lives of my two brothers: 
Fix your obedience there, leave me a servant.

VORTIGER 
[To Lupus and Germanus] You may even at this instant.

[Constantius is crowned.]

CONSTANTIUS 
Oh, this cruelty!

ALL 
Long live Constantius, son of Constantine, King of the Britons!

Flourish.

AURELIUS 
They have chang'd their tune already.

CONSTANTIUS 
I feel want 
And extreme poverty of joy within me: 
The peace I had is parted 'mongst rude men; 
To keep them quiet I have lost it all. 
What can the kingdom gain by my undoing? 
That riches is not bless'd, though it be mighty, 
That's purchas'd with the spoil of any man, 
Nor can the peace so filch'd ever thrive with 'em; 
And if't be worthily held sacrilege 
To rob a temple, 'tis no less offence 
To ravish meditations from a soul, 
The consecrated altar in a man, 
And all their hopes will be beguil'd in me. 
I know no more the way to temporal rule 
Than he that's born and has his year[s] to him 
In a rough desert; well may the weight kill me, 
And that's the fairest good I look for from't.

VORTIGER 
Not so, great king: here stoops a faithful servant 
Would sooner perish under it with cheerfulness 
Than your meek soul should feel oppression 
Of ruder cares; such common, coarse employments 
Cast upon me your subject, upon Vortiger. 
I see you are not made for noise and pains, 
Clamours of suitors, injuries and redresses, 
Millions of rising actions with the sun, 
Like laws still ending and yet never done, 
Of power to turn a great man to the state 
Of his insensible monument with o'erwatching. 
To be oppress'd is not required of you, my lord, 
But only to be king: the broken sleeps 
Let me take from you, sir; the toils and troubles, 
All that is burthensome in authority, 
Please you lay't on me, and what is glorious 
Receive it to your own brightness.

CONSTANTIUS 
Worthy Vortiger, 
If 'twere not sin to grieve another's patience 
With what we cannot tolerate ourselves, 
How happy were I in thee and thy charity. 
There's nothing makes man feel his miseries 
But knowledge only: reason, that is plac'd 
For man's director, is his chief afflicter, 
For though I cannot bear the weight myself, 
I cannot have that barrenness of remorse 
To see another groan under my burthen.

VORTIGER 
[Aside] I'm quite blown up a conscionable way; 
There's even a trick of murdering in some pity. 
The death of all my hopes I see already: 
There was no other likelihood, for religion 
Was never friend of mine yet.

CONSTANTIUS 
[To Monks] Holy partners 
In strictest abstinence, fastings and vigils, 
Cruel necessity has forc'd me from you. 
We part I fear forever, but in mind 
I will be always here; here let me stay.

DEVONSHIRE 
My lord, you know the times.

CONSTANTIUS 
Farewell, bless'd souls, I fear I much offend; 
He that draws tears from you takes your best friend.

Flourish. [Exeunt all but Vortiger.]

VORTIGER 
Can this great motion of ambition stand 
Like wheels false wrought by an unskillful hand? 
Then, time, stand thou too; let no hopes arrive 
At their sweet wishfulness till mine set forward. 
Would I could stay this [existence] as I can 
Thy glassy counterfeit in hours of sand! 
I'd keep thee turn'd down till my wishes rose, 
Then we'd both rise together. 
What several inclinations are in nature! 
How much is he disquieted, and wears royalty 
Disdainfully upon him like a curse. 
Calls a fair crown the weight of his afflictions, 
When here's a soul would sing under the burthen! 
Yet well recovered: I will seek all ways 
To vex authority from him; I will weary him 
As low as the condition of a hound 
Before I give him over, and in all 
Study what most may discontent his blood, 
Making my mask my zeal to th' public good. 
Not possible a richer policy 
Can have conception in the thought of man.

Enter [three] Graziers.

FIRST GRAZIER 
An honourable life enclose your lordship.

VORTIGER 
Now, what are you?

SECOND GRAZIER 
Graziers, an't like your lordship.

VORTIGER 
So it should seem by your enclosures; 
What's your affairs with me?

FIRST GRAZIER 
We are your petitioners, my lord.

VORTIGER 
What? Depart! 
Petitioners to me! Y'have well deserv'd 
My grace and friendship, have you not a ruler 
After your own election? Hie to court, 
Get near and close, be loud and bold enough, 
You cannot choose but speed.

[Exit.]

SECOND GRAZIER 
And that will do't, 
We have throats wide enough, we'll put 'em to't.

Exeunt.


[Dumb show i.]
Music. Dumb show: Fortune is discovered upon an altar, in her hand a golden round full of lots. Enter Hengist and Horsus with others; they draw lots and hang them up with joy: so all depart saving Hengist and Horsus, who kneel and embrace each other as partners in one fortune. To them enter Roxena, seeming to take her leave of Hengist her father, but especially privately and warily of Horsus her lover; she departs weeping, and Hengist and Horsus go to the door and bring in their soldiers with drum and colours, and so march forth.


[Chorus ii.]
[Enter Raynulph.]

RAYNULPH 
When Germany was overgrown 
With sons of peace too thickly sown, 
Several guides were chosen then 
By destin'd lots to lead out men, 
And they whom Fortune here withstands 
Must prove their fates in other lands. 
On these two captains fell that lot; 
But that which must not be forgot, 
Was Roxena's cunning grief, 
Who from the father like a thief, 
Hid her best and truest tears 
Which her lustful lover wears, 
In many a stol'n and wary kiss 
Unseen of father: that maids will do this 
Yet highly scorn to be call'd strumpets too, 
But what they lack on't I'll be [judg'd] by you.

Exit.

[I.ii. A hall in the palace]
Enter Vortiger, Fellmonger, Buttonmonger, [Brazier,] Grazier[s], [and other] petitioners.

VORTIGER 
This way his majesty comes.

ALL 
Thank your good lordship.

VORTIGER 
When you hear yon door open--

FELLMONGER 
Very good, my lord.

VORTIGER 
Be ready with your [several] suits; put forward.

FIRST GRAZIER 
That's a thing every man does naturally, sir, 
That's a suitor, if he mean to speed.

VORTIGER 
'Tis well y'are so deep-learn'd; take no denials.

FELLMONGER 
No, my good lord.

VORTIGER 
Not any, if you love 
The prosperity of your [suits]; you mar all utterly 
And overthrow your fruitful hopes forever 
If either fifth or sixth, nay, tenth repulse 
Fasten upon your bashfulness.

BUTTONMONGER 
Say you so, my lord? 
We can be troublesome and we list.

VORTIGER 
I know't. 
[Aside] I felt it but too late in the [general] sum 
Of your rank brotherhood, which now I'll thank you for. 
While this vexation is in play, I'll study 
To raise a second, then a third to that, 
One still to back another. I'll make quietness 
As dear and precious to him as night's rest 
To a man in suits in law: he shall be glad 
To yield up power; if not, it shall be had.

Exit.

BUTTONMONGER 
Hark! I protest my heart was coming upward, I thought the door had open'd.

[FIRST] GRAZIER 
Marry, would it had, sir.

BUTTONMONGER 
I have such a treacherous heart of mine own, 'twill throb at the very fall of a farthingale.

[FIRST] GRAZIER 
Not if it fall on the rushes.

BUTTONMONGER 
Yes, truly, if there be no light in the room I shall throb presently. The first time it took me my wife was i' th' company; I remember the room was not half so light as this, but I'll be sworn I was a whole hour a-finding on her.

BRAZIER 
Byrlady, y'had a long time of throbbing on't then!

BUTTONMONGER 
Still I felt men, but I could feel no women; I thought they had been all sunk. I have made a vow for't, I'll never have a meeting by candlelight again.

[FIRST] GRAZIER 
Yes, sir, in lanthorns.

BUTTONMONGER 
Yes, sir, in lanthorns, but I'll never trust a naked candle again, take 't on my word.

Enter Constantius and two Gentlemen.

[FIRST] GRAZIER 
Hark there, stand close! It opens now indeed.

BUTTONMONGER 
Oh, majesty, what art thou! I'd give any man half my suit to deliver my petition now; 'tis in the behalf of button-makers, and so it seems by my flesh.

CONSTANTIUS 
[To the Gentlemen] Pray do not follow me, unless you do't 
To wonder at my garments; there's no cause 
I give you why you should. 'Tis shame enough 
Methinks for me to look upon myself; 
It grieves me that more should: the other weeds 
Became me better, but the lords are pleas'd 
To force me to wear these; I would not else. 
I pray be satisfied, I call'd you not. 
Wonder of madness, can you stand so idle 
And know [that] you must die?

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
We are all commanded, sir; 
Besides it is our duty to your grace 
To give attendance.

CONSTANTIUS 
What a wild thing's this! 
We marvel though you tremble at death's name 
When you'll not see the cause why you are [cowards]. 
All our attendances are far too little 
On our own selves, yet you'll give me attendance 
Who looks to you the whilst, and so you vanish 
Strangely and fearfully. For charity's sake, 
Make not my presence guilty of your sloth; 
Withdraw, young men, and find you honest business.

SECOND GENTLEMAN 
[Aside to First Gentleman] What hopes have we to rise by following him? 
I'll give him over shortly.

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
[Aside to Second Gentleman] He's too nice, 
Too holy for young gentlemen to follow 
That have good faces and sweet running fortunes.

Exeunt Gentlemen.

CONSTANTIUS 
Eight hours a day in serious contemplation 
Is but a bare allowance, no higher food 
To th' soul than bread and water to the body, 
And that's but needful then: more would do better.

FIRST GRAZIER 
Let's all kneel together; ['twill] move pity: 
I have been at begging a hundred suits.

[The petitioners kneel.]

CONSTANTIUS 
How happy am I in the sight of you! 
Here are religious souls that lose no time. 
With what devotion do they kneel to heaven 
And seem to check me that am so remiss! 
I bring my zeal amongst you, holy men; 
[If I see any kneel and I sit out,] 
That hour is not well serv'd, methinks. Strict souls, 
You have been of some order in your times?

[FIRST] GRAZIER 
Graziers and braziers some, and this a fellmonger.

BRAZIER 
Here's my petition.

BUTTONMONGER 
Mine, an't like your grace.

[FIRST] GRAZIER 
Look upon mine, I am the longest suitor: 
I was undone seven years ago, my lord.

CONSTANTIUS 
I have mock'd my good hopes. Call you these petitions? 
Why, there's no form of prayer among 'em all!

BUTTONMONGER 
Yes, i' th' [bottom] there's [some] half a line 
Prays for your majesty if you look on mine.

CONSTANTIUS 
Make your request to heaven, not to me.

BUTTONMONGER 
'Las, mine's a supplication for brass buttons, sir.

FELLMONGER 
There's a great enormity in wool, I beseech your grace consider 't.

[FIRST] GRAZIER 
Pastures rise to twopence an acre, my lord. What will this world come to?

BUTTONMONGER 
I do beseech your grace!

[FIRST] GRAZIER 
Good your grace!

CONSTANTIUS 
Oh, this is one of my afflictions 
That with the crown enclos'd me! I must bear it.

[FIRST] GRAZIER 
Your grace's answer to my supplication!

BRAZIER 
To mine, my lord!

CONSTANTIUS 
No violent storm lasts ever, 
That's all the comfort on't.

FELLMONGER 
Your highness' answer!

[FIRST] GRAZIER 
We are almost half undone, the country beggar'd!

BRAZIER 
See, see, he points to heaven, as who should say 
There's enough there; but 'tis a great way thither. 
There's no good to be done here, I see that; we may all spend our mouths like a company of hounds in the chase of a royal deer, and go home and fall to cold mutton bones, when we have done.

BUTTONMONGER 
My wife will hang me; that's my destiny.

Exeunt [all but Constantius].

CONSTANTIUS 
Thanks, heaven, 'tis over; we should never know rightly 
The sweetness of a calm but for a tempest. 
Here's a [wish'd] hour for contemplation now, 
All still and silent; this is a true kingdom.

Enter Vortiger.

VORTIGER 
My lord.

CONSTANTIUS 
Again?

VORTIGER 
Alas, this is but early 
And gentle to the troops of businesses 
That flock about authority, my lord. 
You must forthwith settle your mind to marry.

CONSTANTIUS 
To marry!

VORTIGER 
Suddenly there's no pause given; 
The peoples' wills are violent, 
And covetous of succession from your loins.

CONSTANTIUS 
From me there can come none: a profess'd abstinence 
Hath set a virgin [seal] upon my blood 
And alter'd all the course; the heat I have 
Is all enclos'd within a zeal to [virtue], 
And that's not fit for earthly propagation. 
Alas, I shall but forfeit all their hopes; 
I'm a man made without desires, tell 'em.

VORTIGER 
This gives no satisfaction to their wills, my lord: 
I prov'd them with such words, but all were fruitless; 
Their sturdy voices blew 'em into clouds. 
A virgin of the highest subject's blood 
They have pick'd out for your embrace, and send her 
Bless'd with their general wishes into fruitfulness.

Enter Castiza.

See where she comes, my lord.

CONSTANTIUS 
[Moving aside] [I] never felt 
Unhappy hand of misery till this touch; 
A patience I could find for all but this.

CASTIZA 
My lord, your vow'd love ventures me but dangerously.

VORTIGER 
'Tis but to strengthen a vexation politicly.

CASTIZA 
That's an uncharitable practice, trust me, sir.

VORTIGER 
No more of that.

CASTIZA 
But say he should affect me, sir, 
How should I 'scape him then? I have but one faith, my lord, 
And that you have already; our late contract's 
A divine witness to't.

VORTIGER 
Leave it to me still; 
I am not without shifting rooms and helps 
For all my projects [I] commit with you.

Exit Vortiger.

CASTIZA 
[Aside] 'Tis an ungodly way to come to honour; 
I do not like 't; I love Lord Vortiger, 
But not these practices; th'are too uncharitable.

CONSTANTIUS 
Are you a virgin?

CASTIZA 
Never yet, my lord, 
Known to the will of man.

CONSTANTIUS 
Oh, blessed creature! 
And does too much felicity make you surfeit? 
Are you in soul assured there is a state 
Prepared for you, for you, a glorious one, 
In midst of heaven, now in the state you stand? 
And had you rather, after much known misery, 
Cares and hard labours, mingled with a curse, 
Throng but to th' door and hardly get a place there? 
Think, has the world a folly like this madness? 
Keep still that holy and immaculate fire, 
You chaste lamp of eternity; 'tis a treasure 
Too precious for death's moment to partake, 
This twinkling of short life. Disdain as much 
To let mortality know you as stars 
To kiss the pavements; y'have a substance 
As excellent as theirs, holding your pureness: 
They look upon corruption, as you do, 
But are stars still; be you a virgin too.

CASTIZA 
I'll never marry, what though my troth be engag'd 
To Vortiger. Forsaking all the world 
I save it well and do my faith no wrong. 
Y'have mightily prevail'd, great virtuous lord; 
I'm bound eternally to praise your goodness.

Enter Vortiger and [First] Gentleman.

I carry thoughts away as pure from man 
As ever made a virgin's name immortal.

CONSTANTIUS 
I will do that for joy I never did 
Nor ever will again.

[He kisses her.] Exit Castiza.

[FIRST] GENTLEMAN 
My lord, he's taken.

VORTIGER 
I'm sorry for't; I like not that so well: 
They're somewhat too familiar for their time methinks; 
This way of kissing is no course to vex him. 
Why, I that have a weaker faith and patience 
Could endure more than that coming from woman. 
Dispatch and bring his answer speedily.

Exit Vortiger.

[FIRST] GENTLEMAN 
My lord, my gracious lord.

CONSTANTIUS 
Beshrew thy heart.

[FIRST] GENTLEMAN 
They all attend your grace.

CONSTANTIUS 
I would not have 'em; 
'Twould please me better and they'ld all depart 
And leave the court to me, or put me out 
And take it to theirselves.

[FIRST] GENTLEMAN 
The noon is past, my lord; 
Meat's upon the table.

CONSTANTIUS 
Meat! Away, get from me; 
Thy memory's diseas'd. What saint's eve's this?

[FIRST] GENTLEMAN 
Saint Agatha, I take [it].

CONSTANTIUS 
Oh, is it so? 
I am not worthy to be serv'd before her, 
And so return I pray.

[FIRST] GENTLEMAN 
He'll starve the guard and this be suffer'd; if we set court bellies by a monastery clock, he that breaks a fellow's pate now will scarce be able to crack a louse within this twelvemonth.

[Exit.]

CONSTANTIUS 
Sure 'tis forgetfulness and not man's will 
That leads him forth into licentious ways; 
He cannot certainly commit such errors 
And think upon 'em truly as they are acting. 
Why's abstinence ordain'd but for such seasons?

Enter Vortiger, Devonshire and Stafford.

VORTIGER 
My lord, y'have pleas'd to put us to much pains, 
But we confess 'tis portion of our duties. 
Will your grace please to walk? Dinner stays for you.

CONSTANTIUS 
I have answer'd that already.

VORTIGER 
But, my lord, 
We must not so yield to you, pardon me: 
'Tis for the general good; you must be rul'd, sir. 
Your health and life is dearer to us now; 
Think where you are, at court: this is no monastery.

CONSTANTIUS 
But, sir, my conscience keeps still where it was; 
I may not eat this day.

VORTIGER 
We have sworn you shall, 
And plentifully too; we must preserve you, sir, 
Though you'll be wilful: 'tis no slight condition 
To be a king.

CONSTANTIUS 
Would I were less than man.

VORTIGER 
What, will you make the people rise, my lord, 
In great despair of your continuance 
If you neglect the means that must sustain you?

CONSTANTIUS 
I never eat on [eves].

VORTIGER 
But now you must: 
It concerns others' healths that you take food; 
Y'have chang'd your life, you well may change your mood.

CONSTANTIUS 
This is beyond all cruelty.

VORTIGER 
'Tis our care, my lord.

Exeunt omnes. Music.


II.i. [A room in the palace]
[Enter Vortiger] and Castiza.

CASTIZA 
My lord, I am resolv'd; tempt me no further: 
'Tis all to fruitless purpose.

VORTIGER 
Are you well?

CASTIZA 
Never so perfect in the truth of health 
As at this instant.

VORTIGER 
Then I doubt my own, 
Or that I am not waking.

CASTIZA 
Would you were then; 
You would praise my resolution.

VORTIGER 
This is wondrous. 
Are you not mine by contract?

CASTIZA 
'Tis most true, my lord, 
And I'm better bless'd in't than I look'd for, 
In that I am confin'd in faith so strictly: 
I'm bound, my lord, to marry none but you; 
You'll grant me that, and you I'll never marry.

VORTIGER 
It draws into me violence and hazard! 
I saw you kiss the king.

CASTIZA 
I grant you so, sir. 
Where could I take my leave of the world better? 
I wrong'd not you in that; you will acknowledge 
A king is the best part on't.

VORTIGER 
Oh, my passion!

CASTIZA 
I see you somewhat yielding to infirmity, sir; 
I take my leave.

VORTIGER 
Why, 'tis not possible!

CASTIZA 
The fault is in your faith; time I was gone 
To give it better strengthening.

VORTIGER 
Hark you, lady.

CASTIZA 
Send your intent to the next monastery; 
There you shall find my answer ever after. 
And so with my last duty to your lordship, 
For whose perfections I will pray as heartily 
As for mine own.

[Bows and] exit.

VORTIGER 
How am I serv'd in this! 
I offer a vexation to the king; 
He sends it home into my blood with vantage. 
I'll put off time no longer. I have wrought him 
Into most men's neglect, calling his zeal 
A deep pride hallowed over, love of ease 
More than devotion or the public benefit, 
Which catches many men's beliefs. I am stronger too 
In peoples' wishes; their affections point to me. 
I lose much time and glory; that redeem'd, 
She that now flies returns with joy and wonder: 
Greatness and woman's wish never keep asunder.

Exit.

[Dumb show ii.]
Hoboys. Dumb show. Enter two villains, to them Vortiger seeming to solicit them, gives them gold, then swears them. Exit Vortiger. Enter to them Constantius in private meditation; they rudely come to him, strike down his book and draw their swords upon him. He fairly spreads his arms and yields to their furies, at which they seem to be overcome with pity, but looking on the gold kill him as he turns his back and hurry away his body. Enter Vortiger, Devonshire, Stafford in private conference; to them enter the murderers presenting the head to Vortiger. He seems to express much sorrow, and before the astonished lords makes officers lay hold on 'em, who offering to come towards Vortiger are commanded to be hurried away as to execution. Then the lords, all seeming respect, crown Vortiger; then bring in Castiza, who seems to be brought in unwillingly [by] Devonshire and Stafford who crown her and then give her to Vortiger, she going forth with him with a kind of constrain'd consent. Then enter Aurelius and Uther the two brothers who much astonished seem to fly for their safety.


[Chorus iii.]
[Enter Raynulph.]

RAYNULPH 
When nothing could prevail to tire 
The good king's patience, death had hire 
In wicked strengths to take his life, 
In whom awhile there fell a strife 
[Of] pity and fury, but the gold 
Made pity faint and fury bold. 
Then to Vortiger they bring 
The head of that religious king, 
Who, feigning grief, to clear his guilt 
Makes the [slaughterers'] blood be spilt. 
Then crown they him and force the maid, 
That vow'd a virgin life, to wed. 
Such a strength great power extends: 
It conquers fathers, kin and friends. 
And since fate's pleas'd to change her life, 
She proves as holy in a wife. 
More to tell were to betray 
What deeds in their own tongues must say; 
Only this, the good king dead, 
The brothers poor in safety fled.

Exit.


[II.ii. A hall in the palace]
Enter Vortiger, a Gentleman [meeting him].

GENTLEMAN 
My lord!

VORTIGER 
I fear thy news will fetch a curse, 
It comes with such a violence.

GENTLEMAN 
The people are up in arms against you!

VORTIGER 
Oh, this dream of glory! I could wish 
A sting unto thee; there's no such felt in hell 
The fellow but to mine I feel now. 
Sweet power, before I can have [time] to taste thee 
Must I forever lose thee? What's the impostume 
That swells 'em now?

GENTLEMAN 
The murder of Constantius.

Exit Gentleman.

VORTIGER 
Ulcers of realms! They hated him alive, 
Grew weary of the minute of his reign 
Compared with some kings' time, and poisoned him 
Often before he died in their black wishes, 
Call'd him an evil of their own electing. 
And is their ignorant zeal so fiery now 
When all [their] thanks are cold? The mutable hearts 
That move in their false breasts! Provide me safety!

Shout.

Hark, I hear ruin threaten me with a voice 
That imitates thunder.

Enter Gentleman.

GENTLEMAN 
Where's the king?

VORTIGER 
Who takes him?

GENTLEMAN 
Send peace to all your royal thoughts, my lord; 
A fleet of valiant Saxons newly landed 
Offer the truth of all their service to you.

VORTIGER 
Saxons! My wishes! Let 'em have free entrance 
And plenteous welcomes from all hearts that love us; 
They never could come happier.

Enter Hengist, Horsus, drum and soldiers.

HENGIST 
Health, power, and victory to Vortiger.

VORTIGER 
There can be no more wish'd to a king's pleasure 
If all the languages earth speaks were ransack'd. 
Your names I know not, but so much good fortune 
And warranted worth lightens your fair aspects, 
I cannot but in arms of love enfold you.

HENGIST 
The mistress of our births, hope-[fruitful] Germany, 
Calls me Hengistus, and this Captain Horsus, 
A man low built but, sir, in acts of valour 
Flame is not swifter. We are all, my lord, 
The sons of fortune; she has sent us forth 
To thrive by the red sweat of our own merits, 
And since after the rage of many a tempest 
Our fate has cast us upon Britain's bounds, 
We offer you the first fruits of our wounds.

VORTIGER 
Which we shall dearly prize; the mean'st blood spent 
Shall at wealth's fountain make his own content.

HENGIST 
You double vigour in us then, my lord: 
Pay is the soul of them that thrive by th' sword.

Exeunt omnes.


[II.iii. Near the palace]
Alarums and skirmish. Enter Vortiger and Gentleman.

GENTLEMAN 
My lord, these Saxons bring a fortune with 'em 
Stains any Roman success.

VORTIGER 
On, speak forward; 
I will not take a moment from thy tidings.

GENTLEMAN 
The main supporters of this insurrection 
They have taken prisoners, and the rest so tame 
They stoop to the least grace that flows from mercy.

VORTIGER 
Never came power guided by better stars 
Than these men's fortitudes, yet [th'are] misbelievers; 
'Tis to my reason wondrous.

Enter Hengist, Horsus, with drum, colours, soldiers leading prisoners.

Y'have given me such a first taste of your worth, 
'Twill never from my love; sure when life's gone 
The memory sure will follow, my soul still 
Participating immortality with it. 
And here's the misery of earth's limited glory: 
There's not a way reveal'd to give you honour 
Above the sum which your own praises give you.

HENGIST 
Indeed, my lord, we hold, when all's summ'd up 
That can be made for worth to be express'd, 
The fame that a [man wins] himself is best; 
That he may call his own: honours put to him 
Make him no more a man than his clothes do, 
And as soon taken off, for as in warmth 
The heat comes from the body, not the weeds, 
So man's true fame must strike from his own deeds. 
And since by this event which fortune speaks us 
This land appears the fair predestin'd soil 
Ordain'd for our good hap, we crave, my lord, 
A little earth to thrive on, what you please, 
Where we'll but keep a nursery of good spirits 
To fight for you and yours.

VORTIGER 
Sir, for our treasure, 
'Tis open to your merits as our love, 
But for y'are strangers in religion chiefly, 
Which is the greatest alienation can be 
And breeds most factions in the bloods of men, 
I must not grant you that.

Enter Simon with a hide.

HENGIST 
[Aside] 'S precious!--My lord, 
I see a pattern, be it but so little 
As yon poor hide will compass.

VORTIGER 
How! The hide?

HENGIST 
Rather than nothing, sir.

VORTIGER 
Since y'are so reasonable, 
Take so much in the best part of our kingdom.

HENGIST 
We thank your grace.

[Exit Vortiger.]

Rivers from [bubbling] springs 
Have rise at first, and great from abject things. 
Stay yonder fellow. He came luckily, 
And he shall fare well for't, whate'er he be; 
We'll thank our fortune in rewarding him.

HORSUS 
Stay, fellow.

SIMON 
How, fellow! 'Tis more than you know 
Whether I be your fellow or no, for I am sure 
You see me not.

HENGIST 
Come, what's the price of your hide?

SIMON 
[Aside] Oh, unreasonable villain! He would buy the house o'er a man's head. I'll be sure now to make my bargain wisely; they may buy me out of my skin else.--Whose hide would you have, mine or the beast's? There's little difference in their complexions; I think mine [be] th' better o' th' twain: you shall see for your love and buy for your money. [Aside] A pestilence on you all, how have you gull'd me! You buy an ox hide! You buy a good calf's gather! They are all hungry soldiers and I took 'em for shoemakers.

HENGIST 
Hold fellow, prithee hold. Right a fool wordling 
That kicks at all good fortune! Whose man art thou?

SIMON 
I am a servant, yet I am a masterless man, sir.

HENGIST 
How! Prithee how's that now?

SIMON 
Very nimbly, sir: my master's dead, and I serve my mistress. I am a masterless man, sir; she's now a widow, and I am the foreman of her tan-pit.

HENGIST 
[Giving him money] Hold you and thank your fortune, not your wit.

SIMON 
Faith, and I thank your bounty and not your wisdom; you are not troubled greatly with wit neither it seems. [Aside] Now by this light, a nest of yellowhammers! What will become of me? If I can keep all these without hanging of myself, I am happier than a hundred of my neighbours.--You shall have my skin into the bargain too, willingly, sir, then if I chance to die like a dog, the labour will be saved of fleaing. I'll undertake, sir, you shall have all the skins of our parish at this rate, man and woman's.

HENGIST 
Sirrah, give ear to me: now take your hide 
And cut it all into the slenderest thongs 
That can bear strength to hold.

SIMON 
That were a jest indeed! Go and spoil all the leather? Sin and pity, why, 'twould shoe half your army!

HENGIST 
Do't, I bid you.

SIMON 
What, cut it all in thongs? Hunch, [this] is like the vanity of your Roman gallants, that cannot wear good suits but they must have 'em cut and slash'd into giggets, that the very crimson taffety sits blushing at their follies. I would I might persuade you, sir, from the humour of cutting; 'tis but a kind of swaggering condition and nothing profitable. What an't were but well pinked? 'Twould last longer for a summer suit.

HENGIST 
What a gross lump of ignorance have I lighted on! 
I must be forc'd to beat my drift into him. 
Look you, to make you wiser than your parents, 
I have so much ground given me as this hide will compass, 
Which, as it is, is nothing.

SIMON 
Nothing, quoth 'a! 
Why, 'twill not keep a hog!

HENGIST 
Now with the vantage 
Cut into several parcels, 'twill stretch [far] 
And make a liberal circuit.

SIMON 
A shame on your crafty hide! Is this your cunning? I have learn'd more knavery now than ever I shall shake off while I live. I'll go purchase lands by cows' tails and undo the parish; three good bulls' pizzles would set up a man forever. This is like a pin a day doubled to set up a haberdasher of small wares.

HENGIST 
Thus men as mean to thrive as we must learn, captain, 
Set in a foot at first.

SIMON 
A foot do you call it? 
The devil's in that foot, it takes up all 
This leather.

HENGIST 
Dispatch, away, and cut it carefully 
With all the advantage, sirrah.

SIMON 
You could never have lighted upon such a fellow, captain, to serve your turn. I have such a trick of stretching too--I learnt it of a tanner's man that was hang'd last sessions--that I'll warrant you I'll get you in a mile and a half more than y'are aware of.

HENGIST 
Pray serve me so as oft as you will, sir.

SIMON 
I'm casting about for nine acres to make you a garden plot out of one of the buttocks.

HENGIST 
'Twill be a good soil for nosegays.

SIMON 
'Twill be a good soil for cabbages to stuff out the guts of your fellows there.

Exit Simon.

HENGIST 
You, sirs, go see it carefully perform'd; 
It is the first foundations of our fortunes 
On Britain's earth and ought to be embrac'd 
With a respect near-link'd to adoration.

[Exeunt soldiers.]

Methinks it sounds to me a fair assurance 
Of large honours and hopes, does't not, captain?

HORSUS 
How many have begun with less at first 
That have departed emperors from their bodies, 
And left their carcasses as much in monument 
As would erect a college?

HENGIST 
There's the fruits 
Of their religious shows too, to lie rotting 
Under a million spent in gold and marble, 
When thousands left behind dies without shelter, 
Having nor house nor food.

HORSUS 
A precious charity. 
But where shall we make choice of our ground, captain?

HENGIST 
About the fruitful banks of [uberous] Kent, 
A fat and olive soil; there we came in. 
Oh, captain, h'as given [he knows] not what!

HORSUS 
Long may he give so.

HENGIST 
I tell thee, sirrah, he that begg'd a field 
Of fourscore acres for a garden plot, 
'Twas pretty well, but he came short of this.

HORSUS 
Send over for more Saxons.

HENGIST 
With all speed, captain.

HORSUS 
Especially for Roxena.

HENGIST 
Who, my daughter?

HORSUS 
That star of Germany, forget not her, sir, 
She is a fair, fortunate maid--[aside] I shall betray myself-- 
Fair is she, and most fortunate may she be. 
[Aside] But in maid lost forever: my desire 
Has been the close confusion of that name. 
A treasure 'tis, able to make more thieves 
Than cabinets set open to entice, 
Which learns one theft that never knew the vice.

HENGIST 
Some I'll dispatch with speed.

HORSUS 
Do you forget not.

HENGIST 
Marry, pray help my memory if I should.

HORSUS 
Roxena, you remember?

HENGIST 
What more dear, sir?

HORSUS 
I see you need no help; your memory's clear, sir.

Shout and flourish.

HENGIST 
Those shouts leapt from our army.

HORSUS 
They were too cheerful 
To voice a bad event.

Enter Gentleman Saxon.

HENGIST 
Now, sir, your news?

GENTLEMAN SAXON 
Roxena the fair.

HENGIST 
True, she shall be sent for.

GENTLEMAN SAXON 
She's here.

HENGIST 
What sayst?

GENTLEMAN SAXON 
She's come, sir.

HORSUS 
[Aside] A new youth 
Begins me o'er again!

GENTLEMAN [SAXON] 
Followed you close, sir, 
With such a zeal as daughter never equall'd, 
Expos'd herself to all the merciless dangers 
Set in mankind or fortune, not regarding 
Aught but your sight.

HENGIST 
Her love is infinite to me.

HORSUS 
[Aside] Most charitably censor'd! 'Tis her cunning, 
The love of her own lust, which makes a woman 
Gallop down hill as fearless as a drunkard; 
There's no true lodestone i' th' world but that. 
It draws 'em through all storms by sea or shame: 
Life's loss is thought too small to pay that game.

GENTLEMAN [SAXON] 
What follows more of her will take you strongly.

HENGIST 
How!

GENTLEMAN [SAXON] 
Nay, 'tis worth your wonder.

HENGIST 
I thirst for't.

GENTLEMAN [SAXON] 
Her heart joy-ravish'd at your late success, 
Being the early morning of your fortunes 
So prosperously new-opening at her coming, 
She takes a cup of gold and midst the army, 
Teaching her knee a current cheerfulness 
Which well became her, drank a liberal health 
To the king's joys and yours, the king in presence, 
Who with her sight, but her [behaviour] chiefly-- 
Or chief I know not which, but one or both-- 
But he's so far 'bove my expression caught, 
'Twere art enough for [one] man's time and portion 
To speak him and miss nothing.

HENGIST 
This is astonishing!

HORSUS 
[Aside] Oh, this ends bitter now! Our close hid flame 
Will break out of my heart: I cannot keep it.

HENGIST 
Gave you attention to this, captain? How now, man?

HORSUS 
A kind of grief about these times o' th' moon still; 
I feel a pain like a convulsion, 
A cramp at heart, I know not what name fits it.

HENGIST 
Nor never seek [one] for't; let it go 
Without a name. Would all griefs were serv'd so; 
Our using of 'em mannerly makes 'em grow.

Flourish. Enter Vortiger, Roxena, attendants.

HORSUS 
[Aside] A love knot already, arm in arm!

VORTIGER 
What's he lays claim here?

HENGIST 
In right of fatherhood 
I challenge an obedient part, my lord.

VORTIGER 
Take 't, and send back the rest.

HENGIST 
What means your grace?

VORTIGER 
You'll keep no more than what belongs to you, will you?

HENGIST 
That's all, my lord, it all belongs to me; yet 
I keep a husband's interest till he come. 
Yet out of duty and respect of majesty, 
I send her back your servant.

VORTIGER 
My mistress, sir, or nothing.

HENGIST 
Come again; 
I [never] thought to have heard so ill of thee.

VORTIGER 
How, sir! So ill?

HENGIST 
So beyond detestable, 
To be an honest vassal is some calling; 
Poor is the worst of that, shame comes not to't. 
But mistress: that's the only common bait 
Fortune sets at all hours, catching whore[s] with it, 
And plucks 'em up by clusters. There's my sword, my lord, 
And if your strong desires aim at my blood, 
Which runs too purely there, a nobler way 
Quench it in mine.

VORTIGER 
I ne'er took sword in vain. 
Hengist, we here create thee Earl of Kent.

HORSUS 
[Aside, and falling down] Oh, that will do't, 'twill do't!

VORTIGER 
What ails our friend? Look to him.

ROXENA 
Oh, 'tis his epilepsy, I know it well; 
I [holp] him once in Germany. Com'st again? 
A virgin's right hand strok'd upon his heart 
Gives him ease straight, but 't must be a pure virgin, 
Or else it brings no comfort.

VORTIGER 
[Aside] What a task 
She puts upon herself! Unurg'd-for purity! 
The proof of this will bring love's rage upon me.

[Roxena kneels by Horsus, and they talk aside.]

ROXENA 
Oh, this would mad a woman! There's no plague 
In love to indiscretion.

HORSUS 
Pish, this cures not.

ROXENA 
Dost think I'll ever wrong thee?

HORSUS 
Oh, most feelingly! 
But I'll prevent it now and break thy neck 
With thy own cunning; thou hast undertook 
To give me help, to bring in royal credit, 
Thy crack'd virginity, but I'll spoil all: 
I will not stand on purpose, though I could, 
But fall still, to disgrace thee.

ROXENA 
What, you will not?

HORSUS 
I have no other way to help myself, 
For when thou't known to be a whore impost'rous, 
I shall be sure to keep thee.

ROXENA 
Oh, sir, shame me not! 
Y'have had what's precious; try my faith yet once more: 
Undo me not at first in chaste opinion.

HORSUS 
All this art shall not make me find my legs.

ROXENA 
I prithee wilt thou wilfully confound me?

HORSUS 
Well, I'm content for this time to recover 
To save thy credit and bite in my pain, 
But if thou ever fail'st me, I will fall 
And thou shalt never get me up again.

ROXENA 
Agreed 'twixt you and I, sir.--[Raising him] See, my lord, 
A poor maid's work: the man may pass for health now 
Among the clearest bloods and whose are nicest.

VORTIGER 
I have heard of women bring men on their knees, 
But few that [e'er restor'd] 'em. How now, captain?

HORSUS 
My lord, methinks I could do things past man, 
I'm so renew'd in vigour; I long most 
For violent exercise to take me down: 
My joy's so high in blood I am above [frailty].

VORTIGER 
My Lord of Kent?

HENGIST 
Your love's unworthy creature.

VORTIGER 
Seest thou this fair [chain]? Think upon the means 
To keep it link'd forever.

HENGIST 
Oh, my lord, 
'Tis many degrees sund'red from that hope! 
Besides your grace has a young, virtuous queen.

VORTIGER 
I say think on't, think on't.

HORSUS 
[Aside] And this wind hold 
I shall even fall to my old disease again.

VORTIGER 
[To Roxena] There's no fault in thee but to come so late; 
All else is excellent, I chide none but fate.

Flourish, cornets. Exeunt.


III.i. [A room in the palace]
Enter Horsus, Roxena.

ROXENA 
I have no conceit now that you ever lov'd me, 
But as lust held you for the time.

HORSUS 
So, so.

ROXENA 
Do you pine at my advancement, sir?

HORSUS 
Oh, barrenness 
Of understanding! What a right love is this! 
'Tis you that fall, I that am reprehended! 
What height of honours, eminence and fortune 
Should ravish me from you?

ROXENA 
Who can tell that, sir? What's he can judge 
Of a man's appetite before he sees him eat? 
Who knows the strength of any's constancy 
That never yet was tempted? We can call 
Nothing our own if they be deeds to come; 
They are only ours when they are pass'd and done. 
How bless'd are you above your apprehension 
If your desire would lend you so much patience 
To examine the adventurous condition 
Of our affections, which are full of hazard, 
And draw in the time's goodness to defend us! 
First, this bold course of ours can't last long, 
Or never does in any without shame, 
And that, you know, brings danger; and the greater 
My father is in blood, as he's well risen, 
The greater will the storm of his rage be 
'Gainst his blood['s] wronging; I have cast for this. 
'Tis not advancement that I love alone, 
'Tis love of shelter, to keep shame unknown.

HORSUS 
Oh, were I sure of thee, as 'tis impossible 
There to be ever sure where there's no hold, 
Your pregnant hopes should not be long arising!

ROXENA 
By what assurance have you held me thus far 
Which you found firm, despair you [not] in that.

HORSUS 
True, that was good security for the time, 
But admit a change of state. When y'are advanc'd 
You women have a French toy in your pride; 
You make your friend come crouching, or perhaps, 
To bow i' th' hams the better, he is put 
To complement three hours with your chief gentlewoman, 
Then perhaps not admitted, nay, nor never: 
That's the more noble fashion. Forgetfulness: 
'Tis the pleasing'st virtue anyone can have 
That rises up from nothing, for by the same 
Forgetting all they forget from whence they came, 
An excellent property for oblivion.

ROXENA 
I pity all the fortunes of poor women 
Now in mine own unhappiness. When we have given 
All that we have to men, what's our requital? 
An ill-[fac'd] jealousy, which resembles much 
The mistrustfulness of an insatiate thief 
That scarce believes he has all, though he has stripp'd 
The true man naked and [left] nothing on him 
But the hard cord that binds him: so are we 
First robb'd and then left bound by jealousy. 
Sure he that finds us now has a great purchase, 
And well he [gains] that builds another's ruins, 
Yet man--the only seed that's sown in envy, 
Whom little would suffice as any creature 
Either in food or pleasure--yet 'tis known 
What would give ten enough contents not one. 
A strong diseas'd conceit may tell strange tales to you 
And so abuse us both: take but th' opinion 
Of common reason, and you'll find 't impossible 
That you should lose me in this king's advancement, 
Who here's a usurper. As he has the kingdom, 
So shall he have my love by usurpation; 
The right shall be in thee still: my ascension 
To dignity is but to waft thee upward, 
And all usurpers have a falling-sickness, 
They cannot keep up long.

HORSUS 
May credulous man 
Put all his confidence in so weak a bottom 
And make a saving voyage?

ROXENA 
Nay, as gainful 
As ever man yet made.

HORSUS 
Go, take thy fortune, 
Aspire with my consent, so thy ambition 
Will be sure to prosper. Speak the fair certainty 
Of Britain's queen home to thy wishes.

ROXENA 
Speak 
In hope I may, but not in certainty.

HORSUS 
I say in both: hope and be sure I'll quickly 
Remove her that stands between [thee and] thy glory.

ROXENA 
Life is love! 
If lost virginity can win such a day, 
I'll have no daughter but shall learn my way.

Exit Roxena.

HORSUS 
'Twill be good work for him that first instructs 'em, 
Maybe some son of mine, got by this woman too. 
Man's scattered lust brings forth most strange events, 
An' 'twere but strictly thought on. How many brothers 
Wantonly got through ignorance of their births 
May match with their own sisters!

Enter Vortiger.

[Aside] Peace, 'tis he. 
Invention fail me not; 'tis a gallant's credit 
To marry his whore bravely.

VORTIGER 
[Aside] Have I power 
Of life and death, and cannot command ease 
In mine own blood? After I was a king 
I thought I never should have felt pain more, 
That there had been a ceasing of all passions 
And common stings, which subjects use to feel, 
That were created with a [patience] fit 
For all extremities: but such as we 
Know not the way to suffer; then to do't, 
How most prepost'rous 'tis! What's all our greatness 
If we that prescribe bounds to meaner men 
Must not pass these ourselves? Oh, most ridiculous! 
This makes the vulgar merry to endure, 
Knowing our state is strict and less secure. 
I'll break through custom. Why should not the mind, 
The nobler part that's of us, be allow'd 
Change of affections, as our bodies are 
Still change of food and raiment? I'll have't so. 
All fashions appear strange at first production, 
But this would be well followed.--Oh, captain!

HORSUS 
My lord, I grieve for you; [you] scarce fetch breath 
But a sigh hangs at end on't: this is no way 
If you'll give way to counsel.

VORTIGER 
Set me right then, 
And quickly, sir, or I shall curse thy charity 
For lifting up my understanding to me 
To show that I was wrong: ignorance is safe; 
I slept happily. If knowledge mend me not 
Thou hast committed a most cruel sin, 
To [wake] me into judgment and then leave me.

HORSUS 
I will not leave you so, sir, that were rudely [done]. 
First y'have a flame too open and too violent, 
Which like blood-guiltiness in an offender 
Betrays him when none can: out with it, sir, 
Or let some cunning coverture be made 
Before our practice enters, 'twill spoil all else.

VORTIGER 
Why, look you, sir, I can be as calm as silence 
All the whiles music plays; strike on, sweet friend, 
As mild and merry as the heart of [innocence]. 
I prithee take my temper. Has a virgin 
A heat more modest?

HORSUS 
[Aside] He does well to ask me; 
I [could] have told that once.--Why, here's a government! 
There's not a sweeter amity in friendship 
Than in this friendly league 'twixt you and health.

VORTIGER 
Then since thou find'st me capable of happiness, 
Instruct me with the practice.

HORSUS 
What would you say, my lord, 
If I ensnare her in an act of lust?

VORTIGER 
Oh, there were art to the life! But that's impossible; 
I prithee flatter me no further with't. 
[Fie], so much sin as goes to make up that 
Will ne'er prevail with her: why, I tell thee, sir, 
She's so sin-killing modest, that if only 
To move the question were enough adultery 
To cause a separation, there's no gallant 
So brassy-impudent durst undertake 
The words that should belong to't.

HORSUS 
Say you so, sir? 
There's nothing made i' th' world but has a way to't, 
Though some be harder than the rest to find, 
Yet one there is, that's certain, and I think 
I have took the course to light on't.

VORTIGER 
Oh, I pray for't!

HORSUS 
I heard you lately say, from whence, my lord, 
My practice receiv'd life first, that your queen 
Still consecrates her time to contemplation, 
Takes solitary walks.

VORTIGER 
Nay, late and early, sir, 
Commands her weak guard from her, which are but women 
When 'tis at [strongest].

HORSUS 
I like all this well, my lord. 
And now your grace shall know what net is us'd 
In many places to catch modest women, 
Such as will never yield by prayers or gifts. 
Now there be some will catch up men as fast, 
But those she-fowlers nothing concerns us: 
Their birding is at windows, ours abroad, 
Where ring-doves should be caught, that's married wives 
Or chaste maids, what the appetite has a mind to. 
'Tis practis'd often, therefore worth discovery 
And may well fit the purpose.

VORTIGER 
Make no pause then.

HORSUS 
The honest gentlewoman, where'er she be, 
When nothing will prevail, I pity her now; 
Poor soul, she's entic'd forth by her own sex 
To be betray'd to man, who in some garden-house 
[Or] remote walk, taking his lustful time, 
Binds darkness on her eyes, surprises her, 
And having a coach ready, turns her in, 
Hurrying her where he list for the sin's safety, 
Making a rape of honour without words, 
And at the low ebbs of his lust, perhaps 
Some three days after, sends her coach again 
To the same place, and, which would make most mad, 
She's spoil'd of all, yet knows not where she was robb'd: 
Wise, dear, precious mischief.

VORTIGER 
Is this practis'd?

HORSUS 
Too much, my lord, to be so little known; 
A springe to catch a maidenhead after sunset, 
Clip it, and send it home again to th' city: 
There 'twill be ne'er perceiv'd.

VORTIGER 
My raptures want expression! I conceit 
Enough to make me fortunate and thee great.

HORSUS 
Ay, [practise] it then, my lord. [Aside] I knew 'twould take.

Exeunt.


[III.ii. Grounds near the palace]
Enter Castiza [with] a book, two Ladies.

CASTIZA 
Methinks you live strange lives! When I see't not, 
The less it grieves me; you know how to ease me then. 
If you but knew how well I lov'd your absence 
You would bestow 't upon me without asking.

FIRST LADY 
Faith, for my part, were it no more for ceremony 
Than 'tis for love, you should walk long enough 
For my attendance; so think all my fellows, 
Though they say nothing. Books in women's hands 
They are as much against the hair, methinks, 
As to see men [wear] stomachers and night-rails! 
She that has the green sickness and should follow her counsel would die like an ass and go to th' worms like a salad; not I as long as such a creature as man is made: she's a fool that will not know what he's good for.

Exeunt Ladies.

CASTIZA 
Though amongst lives' elections that of virgin 
I speak noblest of, yet 't has pleas'd just heaven 
To send me a contented blessedness 
In this of marriage, which I ever doubted; 
I see the king's affection was a true one, 
It lasts and holds out long: that['s] no mean virtue 
In a commanding man, though in great fear 
At first I was enforc'd to venture on't.

Enter Vortiger and Horsus [disguised, to one side].

VORTIGER 
All's happy, clear and safe.

HORSUS 
The rest comes gently then.

VORTIGER 
Be sure you seize on her full sight at first, 
For fear of my discovery.

HORSUS 
I'll not miss it.

VORTIGER 
Now fortune, and I am sped.

[Horsus seizes and blindfolds Castiza.]

CASTIZA 
Oh, help, treason, treason!

HORSUS 
Sirrah, how stand you? Prevent noise and clamour, 
Or death shall end thy service.

VORTIGER 
[Aside] A sure cunning.

CASTIZA 
Oh, rescue!

HORSUS 
Dead her voice; away, make speed!

[Vortiger gags her.] Exeunt and enter again.


[III.iii. Off a country road]
CASTIZA 
No help, no succour?

HORSUS 
Louder yet? [Extend] 
Your voice to the last rack, you shall have leave now; 
Y'are far from any pity.

CASTIZA 
What's my sin?

HORSUS 
Contempt of man, and he's a noble creature, 
And takes it in ill part to be despis'd.

CASTIZA 
I never despis'd any.

HORSUS 
No? You hold us 
Unworthy to be lov'd. What call you that?

CASTIZA 
I have a lord disproves you.

HORSUS 
Pish, your lord! 
You're bound to love your lord, that's no thanks to you; 
You should love those you are not tied to love: 
That's the right trial of a woman's charity.

CASTIZA 
I know not what you are nor what my fault is, 
But if't be life you seek, whate'er you be, 
Use no immodest words and take it from me: 
You kill me more in talking sinfully 
Than acting cruelly; be so far pitiful 
To end me without words.

HORSUS 
Long may you live, 
The wish of a good subject; 'tis not life 
That I thirst after: loyalty forbid 
I should commit such treason! You mistake me, 
I have no such bloody thought; only your love 
Shall content me.

CASTIZA 
What said you, sir?

HORSUS 
Thus, thus plainly, 
To strip my words as naked as my purpose, 
I must and will enjoy you.

[Castiza swoons.]

Gone already? 
Look to her, bear her up, she goes apace. 
I fear'd this still, and therefore came provided.

[Takes out a vial and gives some of its liquid to Castiza.]

There's that will fetch life from a dying spark 
And make it spread a furnace; she's well straight. 
It kept a lord seven years alive together 
In spite of nature, that he look'd like one 
Had leave to walk out of a grave to air himself 
Yet still walked lord.

[Castiza recovers.]

Pish, let her go; she stands, 
Upon my knowledge, or else she counterfeits. 
I know the virtue.

CASTIZA 
Never did sorrows in afflicted woman 
Meet with such cruelty; such hard-hearted ways 
Human invention never found before. 
To call back life to live is but ill-taken 
By some departing soul; then to force mine back 
To an eternal act of death in lust, 
What is it but most execrable?

HORSUS 
So, so; 
But this is from the business. List to me: 
Here you are now far from all hope of friendship, 
Save what you make mine; 'scape me you cannot, 
Send your soul that assurance. That resolv'd on 
You know not who I am nor never shall, 
I need not fear you then; but give consent 
Then with the faithfulness of a true friend: 
I'll open myself to you, fall your servant, 
As I do now in hope, proud of submission, 
And seal the deed up with eternal secrecy, 
Not death should pick it open, much less [the] king's 
Authority or torture.

VORTIGER 
[Aside] I admire him.

CASTIZA 
[Kneeling] Oh, sir, whate'er you are, I teach my knee 
Thus to requite you; be content to take 
Only my sight as ransom for mine honour, 
And where you have but mock'd mine eyes with darkness, 
Pluck 'em out quite: all outward light of body 
I'll spare most willingly, but take not from me 
That which must guide me to another world 
And leave me dark forever, fast without 
That cursed pleasure which would make two souls 
Endure a famine everlastingly.

HORSUS 
[Aside] This almost moves.

VORTIGER 
[Aside] By this light, he'll be taken.

HORSUS 
[Aside] I'll wrastle down all pity.--Will you consent?

CASTIZA 
I'll never be so guilty.

HORSUS 
Farewell words then; 
You hear no more of me, but thus I seize thee.

CASTIZA 
Oh, if a power above be [reverenc'd] in thee, 
I bind thee by that name, by manhood, nobleness, 
And all the charms of honour!

Exeunt Vortiger [carrying off] Castiza.

HORSUS 
Here's one caught 
For an example; never was poor lady 
So mock'd into false terror. With what anguish 
She lies with her own lord! Now she could curse 
All into barrenness and beguile herself by it. 
Conceit's a powerful thing, and is indeed 
Plac'd as a palate to taste grief or love, 
And as that relishes so we approve: 
Hence it comes that our taste is so beguil'd, 
Changing pure blood for some that's mix'd and soil'd.

Exit.


[III.iv. A chamber in a castle near Quinborough]
Enter Hengist.

HENGIST 
A fair and fortunate constellation reign'd 
When we set footing here: from his first gift, 
Which to a king's unbounded eyes seem'd nothing, 
The compass of a hide, I have erected 
A strong and spacious castle, yet contain'd myself 
Within my limits, without check or censure. 
Thither, with all the observance of a subject, 
The liveliest witness of a grateful mind, 
I purpose to invite him and his queen 
And feast 'em nobly.

A noise. Barber and Tailor within.

BARBER 
[Within] We will enter, sir; 
'Tis a state business of a twelvemonth long, 
The choosing of a mayor.

HENGIST 
What noise is that?

TAILOR 
[Within] Sir, we must speak with the good Earl of Kent; 
Though we were ne'er brought up to keep a door, 
We are as honest, sir, as some that do.

Enter Gentleman [Saxon].

HENGIST 
Now what's the occasion of their clamours, sir?

GENTLEMAN [SAXON] 
Please you, my lord, a company of townsmen 
Are bent against all denials and resistance 
To have speech with your lordship, and that you 
Must end a difference, which none else can do.

HENGIST 
Why, then there's reason in their violence, 
Which I never look'd for: let in first but one, 
And as we relish him the rest comes on.

Exit Gentleman [Saxon].

'Twere no safe wisdom in a rising man 
To slight off such as these; nay, rather these 
Are the foundation of a lofty work: 
We cannot build without them and stand sure; 
He that ascends up to a mountain's top 
Must first begin at foot.

Enter Gentleman [Saxon].

Now, sir, who comes?

GENTLEMAN [SAXON] 
They cannot yet agree, my lord, of that.

HENGIST 
How!

GENTLEMAN [SAXON] 
They say 'tis worse now for 'em than ever 'twas before, 
For where the difference stood but between two, 
Upon this coming first [they are] at odds; 
One says, sir, he shall lose his place at church by't, 
Another he'll not do his wife that wrong, 
And by their good wills they would come all at first. 
The strife continues in most heat, my lord, 
Between a country barber and a tailor 
Of the same [town], and which your lordship names 
'Tis yielded by consent that one shall enter.

HENGIST 
Here's no sweet [coil]! I'm glad they're so reasonable. 
Call in the barber: if the tale be long 
He'll cut it short, I trust; that's all the hope on't.

Enter Barber.

Now, sir, are [you] the barber?

BARBER 
Oh, most barbarous! A corrector of enormities in hair, my lord, a promoter of upper lips, or what your lordship, in the neatness of your discretion, shall vouchsafe call it.

HENGIST 
Very good, I see this you have without book. 
But what's your business now?

BARBER 
Your lordship comes 
To a high point indeed; the business, sir, 
Lies all about the head.

HENGIST 
That['s] work for you.

BARBER 
No, my good lord, there is a corporation, a kind of body, a body.

HENGIST 
The barber's out at body, let in the tailor. 
This 'tis to reach beyond your own profession: 
When you let go your head, you lose your memory; 
You have no business with the body.

BARBER 
Yes, sir, I am a barber-surgeon: I have had something to do with't in my time, my lord, and I was never so out o' th' body as I have been here of late; send me good luck, I'll go marry some whore or other but I'll get in again.

Enter Tailor.

HENGIST 
Now, sir, a good discovery come from you 
That we may know the inwards of the business.

TAILOR 
I will rip [up] the linings to your lordship, 
And show what stuff 'tis made on; for the body, 
Or corporation--

HENGIST 
There the barber left indeed.

TAILOR 
'Tis piec'd up of two factions.

HENGIST 
A patch'd town the whilst.

TAILOR 
Nor can [we] go through stitch, my noble lord, 
The choler is so great in the one party. 
And as in linsey-woolsey wove together 
One piece makes several suits, so, upright earl, 
Our linsey-woolsey hearts makes all this coil.

HENGIST 
What's all this now? 
Call in the rest; I'm ne'er the wiser yet. 
I should commend my wit could I but guess 
What this would come to.

Enter Glover, Buttonmonger, Brazier [and the other tradesmen].

Now, sirs, what are you?

GLOVER 
Sir-reverence on your lordship, I am a glover.

HENGIST 
What needs that then?

GLOVER 
Sometimes I deal with dog's-leather, 
Sir-reverence all that while.

HENGIST 
Well, to the purpose, if there be any towards.

GLOVER 
I were an ass else, saving your lordship's presence; we have a body, but our town wants a hand, a hand of justice, a worshipful master mayor.

HENGIST 
This is well-handed yet, 
A man may take some hold on't. You want a mayor?

GLOVER 
Right, but there's two at fisticuffs about it, sir, 
As I may say, at daggers drawing, sir, 
But that I cannot say, because they have none; 
And you being Earl of Kent, the town does say 
Your lordship's voice shall choose and part the fray.

HENGIST 
This is strange work for me. Well, sir, what be they?

GLOVER 
The one is a tanner.

HENGIST 
Fie, I shall be too partial; 
I owe too much affection to that trade 
To put it to my voice. [What is] his name?

GLOVER 
Simon, sir.

HENGIST 
How! Simon, too?

GLOVER 
Nay, 'tis but Simon one, sir, the very same Simon 
That sold your lordship the hide.

HENGIST 
What sayst thou?

GLOVER 
That's all his glory, sir: he got his master's widow by't presently after, a rich tanner's wife. She has set him up; he was her foreman a long time in her other husband's days.

HENGIST 
Now let me perish in my first aspiring 
If the pretty [simplicity] of his fortune 
Do not most highly take me; 'tis a presage, methinks, 
Of bright, succeeding happiness to mine 
When my fate's glowworm casts forth such a shine. 
And what's the other that contends with him?

TAILOR 
Marry, my noble lord, a fustian weaver.

HENGIST 
How! Will he offer to compare with Simon? 
He a fit match for him!

Enter Simon and Oliver.

BARBER 
Hark, hark, my lord! 
Here they come both now in a pelting chafe 
From the town-house.

SIMON 
[How]! Before me? I scorn thee, 
Thou wattle-[fac'd], sing'd pig!

OLIVER 
Pig? I defy thee! 
My uncle was a Jew and scorn'd the motion.

SIMON 
I list not brook thy vaunts. Compare with me? 
Thou spindle of concupiscence, 'tis well known 
Thy first wife was a flax-wench.

OLIVER 
But such a flax-wench 
Would I might never want at my most need, 
Nor any friend of mine. My neighbours knew her; 
Thy wife was but a hampen halter to her.

SIMON 
Use better words; I'll hang thee in my year else, 
Let whose will choose thee afterwards.

GLOVER 
Peace! For shame! 
Quench your great spirits. Do not you see his lordship?

HENGIST 
What, Master Simonides?

SIMON 
Simonides? What a fine name he has made of Simon! Then he's an ass that calls me Simon again; I'm quite out of love with't.

HENGIST 
Give me thy hand. I love thee and thy fortunes; 
I like a man that thrives.

SIMON 
I took a widow, my lord, to be the best piece of ground to thrive on, and by my faith, there's a young Simonides, like a green onion, peeping up already.

HENGIST 
Th'ast a good, lucky hand.

SIMON 
I have somewhat, sir.

HENGIST 
But why to me is this election offer'd? 
The choosing of a mayor goes by most voices.

SIMON 
True, sir, but most of our townsmen are so hoarse with drinking, there's ne'er a good voice amongst 'em all that are now here in this company.

HENGIST 
Are you content both to put all to these then, 
To whom I liberally resign my interest 
To prevent censure?

SIMON 
I speak first, my lord.

OLIVER 
Though I speak last, I hope I am not least. 
If [they] will cast away a town-born child, 
They may; 'tis but dying some forty years or so 
Before my time.

HENGIST 
I'll leave you to your choice awhile.

ALL 
Your good lordship.

Exit Hengist.

SIMON 
Look you, neighbours, view us both well ere you be too hasty; let Oliver the fustian weaver stand as fair as I do, and the devil give him good out.

OLIVER 
I do, thou upstart [callymoocher], I do. 'Tis well known to thee I have been twice alecunner, thou mushrump that shot up in one night with lying with thy mistress.

SIMON 
Faith, thou art such a spiny bald-rib, all the mistresses in the town would never get thee up.

OLIVER 
I scorn to rise by a woman, as thou didst; my wife shall rise by me.

SIMON 
The better for some of thy neighbours when you are asleep.

GLOVER 
I pray cease of your communication; we can do nothing else.

[The tradesmen retire and talk amongst themselves.]

OLIVER 
[Aside] I gave that barber a fustian suit, and twice redeem'd his cittern; he may remember me.

SIMON 
[Aside] I fear no false measure but in that tailor; 
The glover and the button-maker are both cocksure; 
That collier's eye I like not. 
Now they consult, the matter is a-brewing. 
Poor Gill my wife lies longing for this news; 
'Twill make her a glad mother.

ALL 
A Simon, a Simon, a Simon, a Simon!

SIMON 
My good people, I thank you all.

OLIVER 
Wretch that I am, tanner, thou hast curry'd favour.

SIMON 
I curry? I defy thy fustian fume!

OLIVER 
But I will prove a rebel all thy year 
And raise up the seven deadly sins against thee.

Exit.

SIMON 
The deadly sins will scorn to rise by thee, and they have any breeding, as commonly they are well brought up; 'tis not for every scab to be acquainted with 'em. But leaving scabs, to you good neighbours [now] I bend my speech. First, to say more than a man can say, I hold it not so fit to be spoken, but to say what man ought to say, there I leave you also. I must confess your loves have chosen a weak and unlearn'd man--that I can neither write nor read you all can witness--yet not altogether so unlearn'd but I could set my mark to a bond, if I would be so simple, an excellent token of government. Cheer you then, my hearts, you have done you know not what. There's a full point; you must all cough and hem now.

ALL 
Hum, hum, hum, cough!

SIMON 
Now touching our common adversary, the fustian weaver, who threateneth he will raise the deadly sins amongst us, which as I take it are seven in number, let 'em come: our town's big enough to hold 'em, we will not much disgrace it; besides, you know a deadly sin will lie in a narrow hole. But when they think themselves safest and the web of their iniquity woven, with the horse-strength of my justice I'll break the looms of their concupiscence, and let the weaver go seek his shuttle. Here you may hem again, if you'll do me the favour.

ALL 
Cough and hem!

SIMON 
Why, I thank you all, and it shall not go unrewarded. Now for the seven deadly sins: first, for pride, which always sits uppermost and will be plac'd without a churchwarden; being a sin that is not like to be chargeable to the parish, I slip it over and think it not worthy of punishment. Now you all know that sloth does not anything; this place, you see, requires wisdom. How can a man in conscience punish that which does nothing? Envy, a poor, lean creature that eats raw liver, perhaps it pines to see me chosen, and that makes me the fatter with laughing; if I punish envy then I punish mine own carcass, a great sin against authority. For wrath, the less we say, the better 'tis; a scurvy, desperate thing it is, that commonly hangs itself and saves justice many a halter by't. Now for covetousness and gluttony, I'll tell you more when I come out of mine office; I shall have time to try what they are, I'll prove 'em soundly, and if I find gluttony and covetousness to be directly sins, I'll bury one i' th' bottom of a chest, and th'other i' th' end of my garden. But, sirs, for lechery, I mean to tickle that home, nay, I'm resolv'd upon't: I will not leave one whore in all the town.

BARBER 
Some of your neighbours may go seek their wives i' th' country then.

SIMON 
Barber, be silent; I will cut thy comb else. To conclude, I will learn the villainies of all trades, mine own I know already: if there be any knavery in the baker, I will bolt it out; if in the brewer, I will taste him throughly, and then piss out his iniquity in his own sinkhole. In a word, I will knock out all enormities like a bullock, and send the hide to my fellow tanners.

ALL 
A Simonides, a true Simonides indeed!

Enter Hengist and Roxena.

HENGIST 
How now, how goes your choice?

TAILOR 
Here's he, my lord.

SIMON 
You may prove I am the man: I am bold to take the upper hand of your lordship a little; I'll not lose an inch of my honour.

HENGIST 
Hold, sirs, there's some few crowns to mend your feast, 
Because I like your choice. [Gives them money.]

BARBER 
Joy bless your lordship! 
We'll drink your health with trumpets.

SIMON 
Ay, with sackbutts, 
That's the more solemn drinking for my state; 
No malt this year shall fume into my pate.

Exeunt [all but Hengist and Roxena].

HENGIST 
Continues still that fervour in his love?

ROXENA 
Nay, with increase, my lord, the flames grows greater, 
Though [he] has learn'd a better art of late 
[To set a screen before it.]

Enter Vortiger and Horsus.

HENGIST 
[Canst] speak low?

[Hengist and Roxena retire to one side, Hengist pretending to have fallen asleep reading a book.]

HORSUS 
Heard every word, my lord.

VORTIGER 
Plainly?

HORSUS 
Distinctly; 
The course I took was dangerous, but not failing, 
For I convey'd [myself] behind the [hangings] 
Even first before [her] entrance.

VORTIGER 
'Twas well ventur'd.

HORSUS 
I had such a woman's first and second longing in me 
To hear her how she would bear her mock'd abuse 
After she was half return'd to privacy, 
I could have fasted out an ember week, 
And never thought of hunger, to have heard her; 
She fetch'd three short turns, I shall ne'er forget 'em, 
Like an imprison'd lark that offers still 
Her wing at liberty and returns check'd: 
So would her soul fain have been gone, and even hung 
Flittering upon the bars of poor mortality, 
Which ever as it offer'd, drove her back again. 
Then came your holy Lupus and Germanus.

VORTIGER 
Oh, two holy confessors.

HORSUS 
At whose sight 
I could perceive her fall upon her breast 
And cruelly afflict herself with sorrow; 
I never heard a sigh till I heard hers, 
Who after her confession, pitying her, 
Put her into a way of patience, 
Which now she holds, to keep it hid from you. 
There's all the pleasure that I took in't now, 
When I heard that my pains was well rememb'red. 
So with applying comforts and relief, 
They have brought it low now to an easy grief, 
But yet the taste is not quite gone.

VORTIGER 
Still fortune 
Sits bettering our [invention].

Enter Castiza.

HORSUS 
Here she comes.

CASTIZA 
[Aside] Yonder's my lord. Oh, I'll return again; 
Methinks I should not dare to look on him.

HORSUS 
She's gone again.

VORTIGER 
It works the kindlier, sir; 
Go [now] and call her back. She winds herself 
Into the snare so prettily, 'tis a pleasure 
To set toils for her.

[Horsus brings Castiza back to Vortiger.]

CASTIZA 
[Aside] He may read my shame 
Now in my blush.

VORTIGER 
Come, y'are so link'd to holiness, 
So taken up with contemplative desires, 
That the world has you yet enjoys you not; 
You have been weeping too.

CASTIZA 
Not I, my lord.

VORTIGER 
Trust me, I fear you have; y'are much to blame 
And you should yield so to passion without cause. 
Is not [there] time enough for meditation? 
Must it lay title to your health and beauty, 
And draw them into time's consumption too? 
'Tis too exacting for a holy faculty. 
[Noticing Hengist] My Lord of Kent? I pray [wake] him, captain; 
He reads himself asleep sure.

HORSUS 
My lord?

HENGIST 
Your pardon, sir.

VORTIGER 
Nay, I'll take away your book and bestow 't here. 
Lady, you that delight in virgin[s'] stories 
And all chaste works, here's excellent reading for you; 
Make of that book as rais'd men make of favour, 
Which they grow sick to part from. And now, my lord, 
You that have so conceitedly gone beyond me 
And made such large use of a slender gift, 
Which we never minded: I commend your thrift, 
And for your building's name shall to all ages 
Carry the stamp and impress of your wit, 
It shall be call'd Thong Castle.

HENGIST 
How, my lord! 
Thong Castle! There your highness quits me kindly.

VORTIGER 
'Tis fit art should be known by her right name; 
You that can spread my gift, I'll spread your fame.

HENGIST 
I thank your grace for that, sir.

VORTIGER 
And, lov'd lord, 
So well we do accept your invitation, 
With all speed we'll set forward.

HENGIST 
Your love honours me.

Music. Exeunt omnes.


IV.i. [A road near Thong Castle]
Enter Vortiger, Castiza, two Ladies, Roxena, Devonshire, Stafford at one door, Simon and his brethren at the other[, a mace and a sword before him].

SIMON 
Lo, I the mayor of Quinborough town by name, 
With all my brethren, saving one that's lame, 
Are come as fast as fiery mill-horse gallops 
To meet thy grace, thy queen and thy fair trollops. 
For reason of our coming do not look, 
It must be done, I found it i' th' town book; 
And yet not I myself: I scorn to read, 
I keep a clerk to do those jobs for need. 
And now expect a rare conceit before Thong Castle [see] thee. 
Reach me the thing to give the king, the other too I prithee. 
Now here they be for queen and thee, the gifts all steel and leather, 
But the conceit of mickle weight, and here they're come together: 
To show two loves must join in one, our town presents to thee 
This gilded scabbard to the queen, this dagger unto thee.

VORTIGER 
Forbear your tedious and ridiculous duties! 
I hate 'em, as I do the rotten roots of you, 
You inconstant rabble; I have felt your fits. 
Sheath up your bounty with your [iron] wits 
And get you gone.

Music. Exeunt King [Vortiger, Castiza], lords [and ladies. Manent Simon and citizens].

SIMON 
Look, sir[s], is his back turn'd?

ALL 
'Tis, 'tis.

SIMON 
Then bless the good Earl of Kent, say I; 
I'll have this dagger turn'd into a pie 
And eaten up for anger, every bit on't. 
And when that pie is new cut up by some rare, cunning pie-man, 
They shall all lamentably sing, "Put up thy dagger, Simon."

Exeunt.


[IV.ii. A hall in Thong Castle]
Hoboys. The king [Vortiger] and his train met by Hengist and Horsus; they salute and exeunt. While the banquet is brought forth, music plays. Enter Vortiger, [Hengist,] Horsus, Devonshire, Stafford, Castiza, Roxena, and two Ladies.

HENGIST 
A welcome, mighty lord, may appear costlier, 
More full of talk and toil, show and conceit, 
But one more stor'd with thankful love and truth 
I forbid all the sons of men to boast of.

VORTIGER 
Why, here's a fabric that implies eternity, 
The building plain, but [most] substantial; 
Methinks it looks as if it mock'd all [ruin], 
Save that great masterpiece of consumation, 
The end of time, which must consume even [ruin] 
And eat that into cinders.

HENGIST 
There's no brass 
Would last your praise, my lord; 'twould last beyond it 
And shame our durablest metal.

VORTIGER 
[Taking him aside] Horsus.

HORSUS 
My lord.

VORTIGER 
This is the time I have chosen; here's [a full] meeting, 
And here will I disgrace her.

HORSUS 
'Twill be sharp, my lord.

VORTIGER 
Oh, 'twill be best, sir.

HORSUS 
Why, here's the earl her father.

VORTIGER 
Ay, and the lord her uncle, that's the height on't, 
Invited both a' purpose to rise sick 
Full of shame's surfeit.

HORSUS 
And that's shrewd, byrlady; 
It ever sticks close to the ribs of honour. 
Great men are never sound men after it; 
It leaves some ache or other in their names still, 
Which their posterity feels at every weather.

VORTIGER 
Mark but the least presentment of occasion; 
As such times yields enough, and then mark me.

HORSUS 
My observance is all yours, you know't, my lord. 
[Aside] What careful ways some take t'abuse themselves! 
But as there be assurers of men's goods 
'Gainst storm or pirate, which gives [venturers] courage, 
So such there must be to make up man's theft, 
Or there would be no woman [venturer] left. 
See, now the[y] find their seats. What a false knot 
Of amity he ties about her arm, 
Which rage must part! In marriage 'tis no wonder 
Knots knit with kisses are oft broke with thunder.

Music.

Music? Then I have done, I always learn 
To give my betters place.

VORTIGER 
Where's Captain Horsus?

HORSUS 
My lord.

VORTIGER 
Sit, sit, we'll have a health anon 
To all good services.

HORSUS 
Th'are poor in these days; 
They had rather have the cup than the health, my lord. 
[Aside] I sit wrong now; he hears me not, and most 
Great men are deaf on that side.

Song. 
If in music were a power 
To breath a welcome to thy worth, 
This should be the ravishing hour 
To vent her spirit's treasure forth. 
Welcome, oh, welcome; in that word alone 
She'ld choose to dwell and draw all parts to one.
VORTIGER 
My Lord of Kent, I thank you for this welcome; 
It came unthought of in the sweetest language 
That ever my soul relish'd.

HENGIST 
You are pleas'd, my lord, 
To raise my happiness from slight deservings, 
To show what power's in princes; not in us 
Aught worthy, 'tis in you that makes us thus. 
I'm chiefly sad, my lord, your queen's not merry.

VORTIGER 
[Aside] So honour bless me, he has found the way 
To my grief strangely.--Is there no delight?

CASTIZA 
My lord, I wish not any, nor is't needful; 
I am as I was ever.

VORTIGER 
That's not so.

CASTIZA 
[Aside] How? Oh, my fears!

VORTIGER 
[When] she writ maid, my lord, 
You knew her otherwise.

DEVONSHIRE 
To speak but truth, 
I never knew her a great friend to mirth, 
Nor taken much with any one delight, 
Though there be many seemly and honourable 
To give content to ladies without taxing.

VORTIGER 
My Lord of Kent, this to thy full desert, 
Which [intimates] thy higher flow to honour. [Drinks.]

HENGIST 
Which, like a river, shall return [service] 
To the great master-fountain.

VORTIGER 
[To First Lady] Where's your lord? 
I miss'd him not till now. Lady, and yours? 
No marvel then we were so out o' th' way 
Of all pleasant discourse: they are the keys 
Of human music; sure at their nativities 
Great nature sign'd a general patent to 'em 
To take up all the mirth in a whole kingdom. 
What's their employment now?

FIRST LADY 
May't please your grace, 
We never are so far acquainted with 'em, 
Nothing we know but what they cannot keep; 
That['s] even the fashion of 'em all, my lord.

VORTIGER 
It seems you have great faith though in their constancy, 
And they in yours, you dare so trust each other.

SECOND LADY 
Hope well we do, my lord; we have reason for't, 
Because they say brown men are honestest, 
But she's a fool will swear for any colour.

VORTIGER 
They would for yours.

SECOND LADY 
Troth, 'tis a doubtful question, 
And I'd be loath to put mine to't, my lord.

VORTIGER 
Faith, dare you swear for yourselves? It's a plain motion.

SECOND LADY 
My lord--

VORTIGER 
You cannot deny that with honour, 
And since 'tis urg'd, I'll put you to't in troth.

FIRST LADY 
May't please your grace--

VORTIGER 
'Twill please me wondrous well, 
And here's a book; mine never goes without one: 
She's an example to you all for purity. 
Come, swear, I have sworn you shall, that you never knew 
The will of any man besides your husband's.

SECOND LADY 
I'll swear, my lord, as far as my remembrance.

VORTIGER 
How! Your remembrance! That were strange.

FIRST LADY 
Your grace 
Hearing our just excuses will not say so.

VORTIGER 
Well, what's your just excuse? Y'are ne'er without some.

FIRST LADY 
I'm often taken with a sleep, my lord, 
The loudest thunder cannot waken me, 
Not if a cannon's burthen be discharg'd 
Close by mine ear; the more may be my wrong: 
There can be no infirmity, my lord, 
That's more excusable in any woman.

SECOND LADY 
And I'm so troubled with the mother too 
I have often call'd in help, I know not whom; 
Three at once has been too weak to keep me down.

VORTIGER 
I perceive there's no fastening: well fare one then 
That ne'er deceives faith's [anchor] of her hold, 
Come at all seasons. [To Castiza] Here, be thou the star 
To guide those erring women, show the way 
Which I will make 'em follow. Why dost start, 
Draw back, and look so pale?

CASTIZA 
My lord--

VORTIGER 
Come hither, 
Nothing but take that oath; thou'lt take a thousand. 
A thousand? Poor! A million, nay, as many 
As there be angels' registers of oaths! 
Why, look thee, over-holy, fearful chastity, 
That sins in nothing but in too much niceness, 
I'll begin first and swear for thee myself: 
I know thee a perfection so unstain'd, 
So sure, so absolute, I will not pant on't 
But catch time greedily. By all these blessings 
That blows truth into fruitfulness, and those curses 
That with their barren breaths blast perjury, 
Thou art as pure as sanctity's best shrine 
From all man's mixture but what's lawful, mine.

CASTIZA 
[Aside] Oh, heaven forgive him, h'as forsworn himself!

VORTIGER 
Come, 
'Tis but going now my way.

CASTIZA 
[Aside] That's bad enough.

VORTIGER 
I have clear'd all doubts, you see.

CASTIZA 
Good my lord, 
Spare me.

VORTIGER 
How! It grows later now, then so 
For modesty's sake make more speed this way.

CASTIZA 
Pardon me, my lord, I cannot.

VORTIGER 
What?

CASTIZA 
I dare not.

VORTIGER 
Fail all confidence 
In thy weak kind forever!

DEVONSHIRE 
Here's a storm 
Able to [wake] all of our name [inhumed] 
And raise 'em from their sleeps of peace and fame 
To set the honour of their bloods right here 
Hundred years after; a perpetual motion 
Has their true glory been from seed to seed, 
And cannot be chok'd now with a poor grain 
Of dust and earth. We that remain, my lord, 
Her uncle and myself, [wood] in this tempest, 
As ever robb'd man's peace, will undertake 
Upon life's deprivation, lands and honour, 
[She shall accept this oath.

VORTIGER 
You do but call me then 
Into a world of more despair and horror; 
Yet since so wilfully you stand engag'd 
In high scorn to be touch'd, with expedition 
Perfect your undertakings with your fames, 
Or by the issues of abus'd belief 
I'll take the forfeit of lives, lands and honours,] 
And make one ruin serve our joys and yours.

CASTIZA 
[Aside] Why, here's a height of misery never reach'd yet; 
I lose myself and others.

DEVONSHIRE 
You may see 
How much we lay in balance with your goodness-- 
And had we more, it went--for we presume 
You cannot be religious and so vild.

CASTIZA 
As to forswear myself, 'tis true, my lord, 
I will not add a voluntary sin 
To a constrain'd one. I confess, great sir, 
The honour of your bed has been abus'd--

VORTIGER 
Oh, beyond patience!

CASTIZA 
Give me hearing, sir: 
But far from my consent, I was surpris'd 
By villains, and so ravish'd.

VORTIGER 
Hear you that, sirs? 
Oh, cunning texture to enclose adultery! 
Mark but what subtle veil her sin puts on: 
Religion brings her to confession first, 
Then steps in art to sanctify that lust. 
'Tis likely you could be surpris'd.

CASTIZA 
My lord!

VORTIGER 
I'll hear no more! Our guard, seize on those [lords].

DEVONSHIRE 
We cannot perish now too fast. Make speed 
To swift destruction; he breathes most accursed 
That lives so long to see his name die first.

[Exeunt Devonshire and Stafford, guarded.]

HORSUS 
[Aside] Ha, ha, here's no dear villainy!

HENGIST 
Let him entreat, sir, 
That falls in [saddest] grief for this event, 
Which ill begins the fortune of this building, 
My lord.

ROXENA 
[Taking Horsus aside] What if he should cause me to swear too, captain? 
You know, sir, I'm as far to seek in honesty 
As the [worst] here can be; I should be sham'd too.

HORSUS 
Why, fool, they swear by that we worship not, 
So you may swear your heart out and ne'er hurt yourself.

ROXENA 
That was well thought on; I'd quite lost myself.

VORTIGER 
You shall prevail in noble suits, my lord, 
But this, this shames the speaker.

HORSUS 
[Aside] I'll step in now, 
Though it shall be to no purpose.--Good my lord, 
Think on your noble and most hopeful issue, 
Lord [Vortimer] the prince.

VORTIGER 
A bastard, sir! 
Oh, that his life were in my fury now!

CASTIZA 
That injury stirs my soul to speak the truth 
Of his conception. Here I take the book, my lord: 
By all the glorified rewards of virtue 
And prepared punishments for consents in sin, 
A queen's hard sorrow never supply'd a kingdom 
With issue more legitimate than [Vortimer].

VORTIGER 
Pish, this takes not out the stain of present shame though; 
To be once good is nothing when it ceases: 
Continuance crowns desert; she ne'er can go 
For perfect-honest that's not always so. 
Beshrew this needless urging of this oath; 
'T has justified her somewhat.

HORSUS 
To small purpose, sir.

VORTIGER 
Amongst so many women not one here 
Dare swear a simple chastity? Here's an age 
To propagate virtue in! Since I have began't, 
I'll shame you all together and so leave you. 
My Lord of Kent.

HENGIST 
Your highness?

VORTIGER 
That's your daughter?

HENGIST 
Yes, my good lord.

VORTIGER 
Though I'm your guest today, 
And should be less austere to you or yours, 
In this [case] pardon me: I will not spare her.

HENGIST 
Then her own goodness friend her; here she comes, my lord.

VORTIGER 
[To Roxena] The tender reputation of a maid 
Makes up your honour, or else nothing can; 
The oath you take is not for truth to man, 
But to your own white soul, a mighty task. 
What dare you do in this?

ROXENA 
My lord, as much 
As chastity can put a woman to, 
I ask no favour; and t' approve the purity 
Of what my habit and my time professes, 
As also to requite all courteous censure, 
Here I take oath I am as free from man 
As truth from death, or sanctity from stain.

VORTIGER 
Oh, thou treasure that ravishes the possessor! 
I know not where to speed so well again; 
I'll keep thee while I have thee. Here's a fountain 
To spring forth princes and the seeds of kingdoms. 
Away with that infection of great honour, 
And those her leprous pledges, by her poison 
Blemish'd and spotted in their fames forever! 
Here [we'll] restore succession with true peace, 
And of pure virgins' grace the poor increase.

Music. Exeunt [all but Horsus].

HORSUS 
Ha ha! He's well provided now; here [struck] my fortune. 
With what an impudent confidence she swore honest, 
Having the advantage of the oath! The mischiefs 
That peoples a lost honour! Oh, they're infinite, 
For as at a small breach in town or castle 
When one has entrance, a whole army follows, 
In woman, so abusively once known, 
Thousands of sins has passage made with one: 
Vice comes with troops, and they that entertain 
A mighty potentate must receive his train. 
Methinks I should not hear from fortune next 
Under an earldom now. She cannot spend 
A night so idly but to make a lord 
With ease, methinks, and play. The Earl [of] Kent 
Is calm and smooth, like a deep, dangerous water. 
He has some secret way; I know his blood: 
The grave's not greedier, nor hell's lord more proud. 
Somewhat will hap, for this astonishing choice 
[Strikes] pale the kingdom, at which I rejoice.

[Exit.]


[Dumb show iii.]
Hoboys. Dumb show. Enter Lupus, Germanus, Devonshire, Stafford leading [Vortimer]; they seat him in the throne and crown him king. Enter Vortiger in great passion and submission; they neglect him, then Roxena expressing great fury and discontent. They lead out [Vortimer] and leave Vortiger and Roxena; she suborns two Saxons to murder [Vortimer]; they swear performance and secrecy, and exeunt with Roxena. Then Vortiger left alone draws his sword and offers to run himself thereon. Enter Horsus and prevents him; then the lords enter again and exit Horsus. Then is brought in the body of [Vortimer] in a chair, dead; they all in amazement and sorrow take Vortiger and upon his submission restore him, swearing him against the Saxons. Then enter Hengist with diverse Saxons, Vortiger and the rest with their swords drawn threaten their expulsion, whereat Hengist, amaz'd, sends one to entreat a peaceable parley, which seeming to be granted by laying down their weapons, exeunt severally.


[Chorus iv.]
Enter Raynulph.

RAYNULPH 
Of pagan blood a queen being chose, 
Roxena hight, the Britons rose, 
For [Vortimer] the[y] crowned king, 
But she soon poisoned that sweet spring. 
Then to rule they did restore 
Vortiger, and him they swore 
Against the Saxons; they, constrain'd, 
Begg'd peace treaty, and obtain'd. 
And now in numbers equally 
Upon the plain near Salisbury, 
A peaceful meeting they decreen 
Like men of love, no weapon seen. 
But Hengist, that ambitious lord, 
Full of guile, corrupts his word, 
As the sequel too well proves; 
On that your eyes, on us your loves.

Exit.


[IV.iii. A plain near Salisbury]
Enter Hengist, Gentleman [Saxon], and Saxons.

HENGIST 
If we let slip this opportuneful hour, 
Take leave of fortune, certainty or thought 
Of ever fixing, we are loose at root, 
And the least storm may rend us from the bosom 
Of this land's hopes forever. But, dear Saxons, 
Fasten we now, and our unshaken firmness 
Will assure after ages.

SAXON 
We are resolv'd, my lord.

HENGIST 
Observ'd you not how Vortiger the king, 
Base in submission, threat'ned our expulsion, 
His arm held up against us? Is't not time 
To make our best preventions? What should check me? 
H'as perfected that great work in our daughter 
And made her queen; she can ascend no higher. 
Nor can the incessant flow of his love['s] praises, 
Which yet still sways, take from that height it raises; 
She's sure enough. What rests then but that I 
Make happy mine own hopes, and policy 
[Forbids] no way, noble or treacherous ended: 
What best effects is of her best commended. 
Therefore be quick, dispatch; here, every man 
Receive into the service of his vengeance 
An instrument of steel, which will unseen 
Lurk like the snake under the innocent shade 
Of a spread summer's leaf, and as great substance 
Blocks itself up into less room in gold 
Than other metals, and less burthensome, 
So in the other hand lies all confin'd 
Full as much death as ever chang'd mankind. 
'Tis all the same time that a small watch shows 
As great church dials, and as true as those. 
Take heart: the commons love us; those remov'd 
That are the nerves, our greatness stands improv'd.

GENTLEMAN [SAXON] 
Give us the word, my lord, and we are perfect.

HENGIST 
That's true, the word; I lose myself. Nemp your sexes: 
It shall be that.

GENTLEMAN [SAXON] 
Enough, sir, then we strike.

HENGIST 
But the king's mine; take heed you touch him not.

GENTLEMAN [SAXON] 
We shall not be at leisure, never fear't; 
We shall have work enough of our own, my lord.

[Enter Vortiger and British Lords.]

HENGIST 
They come. Calm looks but stormy souls possess you.

VORTIGER 
We see you keep your word in all points firm.

HENGIST 
No longer may we boast of so much breath 
As goes to a word['s] making, than of care 
In the preserving of it when 'tis made.

VORTIGER 
Y'are in a virtuous way, my Lord of Kent, 
And since w'are both sides well met like sons of peace, 
All other arms laid by in sign of favour 
If our conditions be embrac'd--

HENGIST 
[Th'are, th'are].

VORTIGER 
[Preparing to embrace him] We'll use no other but these only here.

HENGIST 
Nemp your sexes!

[The Saxons seize the Britons.]

BRITISH LORDS 
Treason, treason!

HENGIST 
Follow to th' heart, 
My trusty Saxons, 'tis your liberty, 
Your wealth and honour! Soft, y'are mine, my lord.

VORTIGER 
Take me not basely, when all sense and strength 
Lies bound up in amazement at this treachery. 
What devil hath breath'd this everlasting part 
Of falsehood into thee?

HENGIST 
Let it suffice 
I have you and will hold you prisoner, 
As fast as death holds your best props in silence. 
We know the hard conditions of our peace, 
Slavery or diminution, which we hate 
With a joint loathing: may all perish thus 
That seek to subjugate or lessen us.

VORTIGER 
Oh, you strange nooks of guile or subtlety, 
Where man so cunningly lies hid from man! 
Who could expect such treason from [your] breast, 
Such thunder from your voice? Or take you pride 
To imitate the fair uncertainty 
Of a bright day, that teems the sudden'st storm, 
When the world least expects one? But of all 
I'll never trust fair sky in a man again; 
There's the deceitful weather. Will you heap 
More guilt upon you by detaining me, 
Like a cup taken after a full surfeit, 
Even in contempt of health and heaven together? 
What seek you?

HENGIST 
Ransom for your liberty 
As I shall like of, or you ne'er obtain 't.

VORTIGER 
Here's a most headstrong, dangerous ambition. 
Sow you the seeds of your aspiring hopes 
In blood and treason, and must I pay for 'em? 
Have not I rais'd you to this height?

HENGIST 
My lord, 
A work of mine own merit, since you enforce it.

VORTIGER 
There's even the general thanks of all aspirers: 
When they have all the honours kingdoms can impart, 
They write above it still their own desert.

HENGIST 
I have writ mine true, my lord.

VORTIGER 
That's all their sayings. 
Have I not rais'd your daughter to a queen?

HENGIST 
Why, y'have the harmony of your pleasure for't; 
Y'have crown'd your own desires! What's that to me?

VORTIGER 
And what will crown yours, sir?

HENGIST 
Faith, things of reason: 
I demand Kent.

VORTIGER 
Why, y'have the earldom on't!

HENGIST 
The kingdom on't, I mean, without control, 
The full possession.

VORTIGER 
This is strange in you.

HENGIST 
It seems y'are not acquainted with my blood yet 
To call this strange.

VORTIGER 
Never was king of Kent yet 
But who was general king.

HENGIST 
I'll be the first then; 
Everything has beginning.

VORTIGER 
No less title?

HENGIST 
Not if you hope for liberty, my lord. 
So dear a happiness would be wrong'd by slighting.

VORTIGER 
Well, take 't, I resign 't.

HENGIST 
Why, I thank your grace.

VORTIGER 
Is your great thirst suffic'd yet?

HENGIST 
Faith, my lord, 
There's yet behind a pair of teeming sisters, 
Norfolk and Suffolk, and I have done with you.

VORTIGER 
Y'have got a fearful thirst, my lord, of late, 
Howe'er you came by't.

HENGIST 
It behooves me then 
For my blood's health to seek all means to quench it.

VORTIGER 
Them too?

HENGIST 
There's nothing will be abated, sir, 
Put your assurance in't.

VORTIGER 
You have the advantage; 
He whom fate captivates must yield to all. 
Take 'em.

HENGIST 
And you your liberty and peace, my lord, 
With our best love and wishes. Here's an hour 
Begins us Saxons in wealth, fame and power.

Exit [with all save Vortiger].

VORTIGER 
Are these the noblest fruits and fair'st requitals 
From works of our own raising? 
Methinks the murther of Constantius 
Speaks to me in the voice on't, and the wrongs 
Of our late queen, slipp'd both into one organ. 
Here is no safety for me but what's most doubtful; 
The rank rout love me not, and the strength I had 
This foul, devouring treachery has demolish'd.

Enter Horsus.

Ambition, hell, mine own undoing, lust, 
And all the brood of plagues conspire against me. 
[I have not a friend left me.]

HORSUS 
My lord, he dies 
That says it but yourself, were't that thief-king 
That has so boldly stol'n his honours from you, 
A treason that wrings tears from honest manhood.

VORTIGER 
So rich am I now in thy love and pity, 
I feel no loss at all; but we must part, 
My queen and I, to Cambria.

HORSUS 
My lord, 
And I not nam'd, that have vow'd lasting service 
To life's extremest minute to your fortunes?

VORTIGER 
Is my ruin'd fate bless'd with so dear a friend?

HORSUS 
My lord, no space in earth nor breadth in sea 
Shall divide me from you.

VORTIGER 
Oh, faithful treasure! 
All my lost happiness is made up in thee.

Exit.

HORSUS 
I'll follow you through the world to cuckold you; 
That's my way now. Everyone has his toy 
While he lives here: some men delight in building 
A trick of Babel and will ne'er be left, 
Some in consuming what was rais'd with toiling, 
Hengist in getting honour, I in spoiling.

Exit.


V.i. [A room in Simon's house]
Enter Simon, clerk [Aminadab], Glover, Fellmonger, Grazier, etc. [as officers]. Music.

SIMON 
Is not that rebel Oliver, the fustian weaver, 
That traitor to my year, 'prehended yet?

[AMINADAB] 
Not yet, so please your worship.

SIMON 
Not yet, sayst thou? 
How dar'st thou say not yet, and see me present? 
Thou malapart clerk that's good for nothing but 
To write and read! Is his loom seiz'd on?

[AMINADAB] 
Yes, 
And it like your worship, and sixteen yards of fustian.

SIMON 
Good; let a yard be sav'd to mend me between the legs, the rest cut in pieces and given to the poor: 'tis heretic fustian, and should be burnt indeed, but being worn threadbare the shame will be as great. How think you, neighbours?

GLOVER 
Greater, methinks, the longer it is worn, 
Where being once burnt it can be burn'd no more.

SIMON 
True, wise and most senseless.

Enter a Footman.

How now, sirrah? 
What's he approaching here in dusty pumps 
And greasy hair?

[AMINADAB] 
A footman, sir, to the great King of Kent.

SIMON 
The King of Kent? Shake him by the hand for me. 
Footman, thou art welcome; lo, my deputy shakes thee: 
Come when my year's out and I'll do't myself. 
An't were a dog come from the King of Kent, 
I keep those officers would shake him, I trow. 
And what's the news with thee, [thou] well-stew'd footman?

FOOTMAN 
The king my master--

SIMON 
Ha?

FOOTMAN 
With a few Saxons 
Intends this night to make merry with you.

SIMON 
Merry with me? I should be sorry else, fellow, 
And take it in evil part, so tell Kent's king. 
Why was I chosen mayor but that great men 
Should make merry with me? There's a jest indeed; 
Tell him I look'd for't, and me much he wrongs 
If he forget Simon that cut out his thongs.

FOOTMAN 
I'll run with your worship's answer.

Exit.

SIMON 
[Do, I prithee.] 
That fellow will be roasted against supper; 
He's half enough already, his [brows] baste him. 
The King of Kent! The king of Kirsendom 
Shall not be better welcome to me, 
For you must imagine now, neighbours, this is 
The time that Kent stands out of Kirsendom, 
For he that's king there now was never kirsen'd. 
This for your more instruction I thought fit, 
That when y'are dead you may teach your children wit. 
Clerk!

[AMINADAB] 
At your worship's elbow.

SIMON 
I must turn you 
From the hall to the kitchen tonight. 
Give order that pigs be roasted yellow, 
Nine geese, and some three larks for piddling meat, 
But twenty woodcocks; I'll bid all my neighbours. 
Give charge the mutton come in all blood-raw; 
That's infidel meat! The King of Kent's a pagan, 
And must be serv'd so. And let those officers 
That seldom or never go to church bring 't in, 
'Twill be well taken; run.

[Exit Aminadab.]

[To an officer] Come hither you now. 
Take all the cushions down and thwack 'em soundly 
After my feast of millers, for their buttocks 
Has left a peck of flour in 'em; beat 'em carefully 
O'er a bolting-hutch: there'll be enough 
For a pan-pudding, as your dame will handle it. 
Then put fresh water into both the bough-pots, 
And burn a little juniper i' th' hall chimney; 
Like a beast as I was, I piss'd out the fire last night 
And never thought of the king's coming.

[Enter Aminadab.]

How now, 
Return'd so quickly?

[AMINADAB] 
Please your worship, there's a certain company of players.

SIMON 
Ha, players!

[AMINADAB] 
Country comedians, interluders, sir, [desire] your worship's leave and favour to enact in the town hall.

SIMON 
I' th' town hall? 'Tis ten to one I never grant it. Call 'em before my worship. If my house will not serve their turn, I would fain see the proudest he lend a barn to 'em.

Enter Cheaters.

Now, sirs, are you comedians?

SECOND CHEATER 
We are anything, sir: comedians, tragedians, tragi-comedians, comi-tragedians, pastorists, humourists, clownists, and satirists; we have 'em, sir, from the smile to the laugh, from the laugh to the handkerchief.

SIMON 
You are very [strong i' th'] wrists; and shall these good parts y'are indued withal be cast away upon peddlers and maltmen?

FIRST CHEATER 
For want of better company, and't please your worship.

SIMON 
What think you of me, my masters? Have you audacity enough to play before so high a person? Will not my countenance daunt you? For if you play before me I shall often look at you; I give you that warning beforehand. Take it not ill, my masters; I shall laugh at you, and truly when I'm least offended with you: my humour 'tis, but be not you abash'd.

FIRST CHEATER 
Sir, we have play'd before a lord ere now, 
Though we be country actors.

SIMON 
A lord? Ha, ha! 
You'll find it a harder thing to please a mayor.

FIRST CHEATER 
We have a play wherein we use a horse.

SIMON 
Fellows, you use no horseplay in my house. 
My rooms are rubb'd; keep it for hackney-men.

FIRST CHEATER 
We will not offer 't to your worship, sir.

SIMON 
Give me a play without a beast, I charge you.

SECOND CHEATER 
That's hard. Without a cuckold or a drunkard?

SIMON 
Oh, those beasts are often the best men i' th' parish, and must not be kept out! But which is your merriest play now? That I would hearken after.

SECOND CHEATER 
Why, your worship shall hear the names all o'er and take your choice.

SIMON 
And that's plain dealing, trust me. Come, begin, sir.

SECOND CHEATER 
The Whirligig, The Whibble, Carwidgen--

SIMON 
Heyday, what names are these?

SECOND CHEATER 
New names of late. 
The Wild Goose Chase.

SIMON 
I understand thee now.

SECOND CHEATER 
Gull upon Gull.

SIMON 
Why, this is somewhat yet.

SECOND CHEATER 
Woodcock of Our Side.

SIMON 
Get you further off then.

FIRST CHEATER 
The Cheater and the Clown.

SIMON 
Is that come up again? 
That was a play when I was prentice first.

SECOND CHEATER 
Ay, but the cheater has learn'd more tricks since, sir, 
And gulls the clown with new additions.

SIMON 
Then is [your] clown a coxcomb? Which is he?

CLOWN 
I am the clown, sir.

SIMON 
[Fie, fie, your company must fall upon him and beat him]; he's too fair to make the people laugh.

FIRST CHEATER 
Not as he may be dress'd, sir.

SIMON 
Faith, dress him how you will, I'll give him that gift he'll never look half scurvily enough. Oh, the clowns that I have seen in my time! The very peeping out of 'em would have made a young heir laugh if his father had lain a-dying; a man undone in law the day before, the saddest case that can be, might for his twopence have burst himself with laughing and ended all his miseries. Here was a merry world, my masters! 
Some talk of things of state, of puling stuff; 
There's nothing in a play to a clown's part, 
If he have the grace to hit on't, that's the thing indeed: 
The king shows well, but he sets off the king, 
But not the King of Kent, I mean not so; 
The king I mean is one I do not know.

SECOND CHEATER 
Your worship speaks with safety, like a rich man, 
And for your finding fault, our hope is greater, 
Neither with him the clown nor me the cheater.

SIMON 
Away then; shift, clown, to thy motley crupper: 
We'll see 'em first, the king shall after supper.

[Exeunt] Cheater[s].

GLOVER 
I commend your worship's wisdom in that, Master Mayor.

SIMON 
Nay, 'tis a point of justice, an't be well examined, not to offer the king worse than I'll see myself, for a play may be dangerous; I have known a great man poison'd in a play.

GLOVER 
What, have you, Master Mayor?

SIMON 
But to what purpose many times I know not.

FELLMONGER 
Methinks they should destroy one another so.

SIMON 
No, no, he that's poison'd is always made privy to it; 
That's one good order they have amongst 'em.

Shout.

What joyful throat is that, Aminadab? 
What is the meaning of this cry?

[AMINADAB] 
The rebel is ta'en.

SIMON 
Oliver the puritan?

[AMINADAB] 
Oliver, puritan and fustian weaver altogether.

SIMON 
Fates, I thank you for this victorious day! 
Bonfires of pease-straw burn; let the bells ring.

GLOVER 
There's two a-mending, sir, you know they cannot.

SIMON 
'Las, the tenor's broken; ring forth the treble.

Enter Oliver [guarded].

I'm overcloy'd with joy! Welcome, thou rebel.

OLIVER 
I scorn thy welcome.

SIMON 
Art thou yet so stout? 
Wilt thou not stoop for grace? Then get thee out.

OLIVER 
I was not born to stoop but to my loom; 
That seiz'd upon, my stooping days are done. 
In plain terms, if thou hast anything to say to me, send me away quickly; this is no biding place. I understand there's players in the house. Dispatch me, I charge thee, in the name of all the brethren.

SIMON 
Nay now, proud rebel, I will make thee stay, 
And to thy greater torment see the play.

OLIVER 
Oh, devil, I conjure thee by Amsterdam!

SIMON 
Our word is past; 
Justice may wink a while but see at last.

[A trumpet sounds, and Oliver struggles.]

The play begins. Hold, stop him, stop him!

OLIVER 
Oh, oh, that profane trumpet!

SIMON 
Set him down there, I charge you, officers.

OLIVER 
I'll hide mine ears and stop mine eyes.

SIMON 
Down with his golls, I charge you!

OLIVER 
Oh, tyranny! Revenge it, tribulation!

SIMON 
For rebels there are many deaths, but sure the only way 
To execute a puritan is seeing of a play.

OLIVER 
Oh, I shall swoon!

SIMON 
But if thou dost, to fright thee, 
A player's boy shall bring thee [aqua-vitae].

Enter First Cheater [and another].

OLIVER 
Oh, I'll not [swoon] at all for't, though I die.

SIMON 
Peace, here's a rascal; list and edify.

FIRST CHEATER 
I say still he's an ass that cannot live by his wits.

SIMON 
What a bold rascal's this! He calls us all asses at first dash; sure none of us lives by our wits, neighbours, unless it be Oliver the puritan.

OLIVER 
I scorn as much to live by my wits as the proudest on you all.

SIMON 
Why, you are an ass for company, Oliver, and so hold your prating.

Enter [Second] Cheater.

SECOND CHEATER 
Fellows in arms, welcome. The news, the news?

SIMON 
Fellows in arms, quoth 'a? He may well call 'em fellows in arms, for they are all out o' th' elbows.

FIRST CHEATER 
Be lively, my heart, be lively; the booty's at hand. He's but a fool of a yeoman's eldest son; he comes balanc'd on both sides, bully: he's going to pay rent with th' one pocket, and buy household stuff with th' other.

SECOND CHEATER 
And if this be his last day, my chuck, he shall forfeit his lease, quoth th' one pocket, and eat his meat i' th' old wooden platters, quoth th' other.

SIMON 
Faith, then he's not so wise as he ought to be if he let such tatterdemalions get th' upper hand on him.

Enter Clown.

FIRST CHEATER 
He comes, he comes.

SECOND CHEATER 
Ay, but do you mark how he comes? Small to our comfort, with both his hands in's pockets. How is't possible to pick a lock when the key's o' th' inside o' th' door?

SIMON 
Ay, here's the part now, neighbours, that carries away the play. If the clown miscarry, farewell my hopes forever, the play's spoil'd.

CLOWN 
They say there's a foolish thing call'd cheaters abroad that will gull any yeoman's son of his purse and laugh in's [face] like an Irishman. I would fain meet with one of those cheaters; I'm in as good state to be gull'd now as ever I was in my life, for I have two purses at this time about me, and I'd fain be acquainted with that rascal that would but take one of 'em now.

SIMON 
Faith, thou mayst be acquainted with two or three that will do their good wills I warrant you.

FIRST CHEATER 
That way's too plain, too easy I'm afraid.

SECOND CHEATER 
Come, come, sir, your familiar cheats takes best; 
They show like natural things and least suspected: 
Give me a round shilling quickly.

FIRST CHEATER 
'Twill but fetch one of his hands neither if it take.

SECOND CHEATER 
Thou art [too] covetous. Let's have one at first, prithee; 
There's time enough to fetch out th'other after. 
[Loudly] Thou liest, 'tis lawful money, current money.

[They draw.]

FIRST CHEATER 
[Loudly] Ay, so is copper in some countries, sir.

CLOWN 
Here's a fray towards, but I'll hold my hands, 
Let whose will part 'em.

SECOND CHEATER 
Copper! I defy thee, 
And now I shall disprove thee. Look you, sir, 
Here comes an honest yeoman's son o' th' country, 
A man of judgment.

CLOWN 
Pray be cover'd, sir; 
I have eggs in my cap, and cannot put it off.

FIRST CHEATER 
Will you be tried by him?

SECOND CHEATER 
I am content, sir.

SIMON 
They look rather as if they would be tried next sessions.

FIRST CHEATER 
Pray give your judgment of this piece of coin, sir.

CLOWN 
Nay, an't be coin you strive about, let's see't; 
I love to handle money.

FIRST CHEATER 
Look on't well, sir.

[They pick his pocket.]

SECOND CHEATER 
Let him do his worst, sir.

CLOWN 
Y'ad need to wear cut clothes, gentlemen, 
Y'are so choleric.

SECOND CHEATER 
Nay, rub it and spare't not, sir.

CLOWN 
Now by this silver, gentlemen, 'tis good money; 
Would y'had a hundred of 'em.

SECOND CHEATER 
We hope well, sir. 
[Aside to First Cheater] Th'other pocket now and we are made men.

[Exeunt Cheaters, manet Clown].

SIMON 
Oh, neighbours, I begin to be sick to see 
This fool so cozen'd; I would make the case mine own.

CLOWN 
Still would I fain meet with this thing call'd cheaters.

SIMON 
A whoreson coxcomb! They have met with thee! 
I can endure him no longer with patience.

CLOWN 
Oh, my rent, my whole year's rent!

SIMON 
A murrain on you! 
This makes us landlords stay so long 
Without our money.

CLOWN 
The cheater[s] have been here!

SIMON 
A scurvy hobby-horse, that could not leave his money with me, having such a charge about him! A pox on thee for an ass! Thou play a clown? I will commit thee for offering on't. Officer, away with him.

GLOVER 
What means your worship? Why, you'll spoil the play, sir.

SIMON 
Before the King of Kent shall be thus serv'd, 
I'll play the clown myself. Away with him!

CLOWN 
With me? An't please your worship, 'twas my part.

SIMON 
But 'twas as foolish a part as ever thou play'd'st in thy life, and I'll make thee smoke for't. I'll teach thee to understand to play a clown, thou shalt know; every man is not born to't. Look thee, away with him quickly,

Exit [officer] with Clown.

He'll have the other pocket; I [heard] him say 't with mine own ears.

[Enter Second Cheater.]

See, he comes in another disguise to cheat thee again.

SECOND CHEATER 
[Aside] Pish, whither goes he now? He spoils all my part.

SIMON 
Come on, sir, let's see what your knaveship can do at me now. You must not think now, rascal, you have no fool in hand; I have committed for playing the part so like an ass.

[He throws off his gown, discovering his doublet with a satin forepart and a canvas back.]

SECOND CHEATER 
What's here to do?

GLOVER 
Fie, good sir, come away. 
Will your worship base yourself to play a clown?

SIMON 
Away, brother, 'tis not good to scorn anything: a man does not know what he may come to; everyone knows his ending but not his beginning. Proceed, varlet, do thy worst, I defy thee!

SECOND CHEATER 
I beseech your worship let's have our own clown; I know not how to go forward else.

SIMON 
Knave, play out thy part with me or I'll lay thee by the heels all the days of thy life else. Why, how now, my masters, who's that laugh'd now? Cannot a man of worship play the clown a little for his pleasure but he must be laugh'd at? Do you know who I am? Is the king's deputy of no better accompt amongst you? Was I chosen to be laugh'd at? Where's my clerk?

[AMINADAB] 
Here, an't please your worship.

SIMON 
Take a note of all those that laugh at me, that when I have done I may commit 'em. Let me see who dares do't now. And now to you once again, sir cheater; look you, here's my purse-strings, I defy thee.

SECOND CHEATER 
Good sir, tempt me not; my part is so written that I should cheat your worship and you were my father.

SIMON 
I should have much joy to have such a rascal to my son.

SECOND CHEATER 
Therefore I beseech your worship pardon me; the part has more knavery than when your worship saw it first. I assure you you'll be deceiv'd in't, sir; the new additions will take any man's purse in Kent or Kirsendom.

SIMON 
And thou canst take mine now, I'll give't thee freely, 
And do thy worst, I charge thee, as thou'lt answer't.

SECOND CHEATER 
I shall offend your worship.

SIMON 
Knave, do't quickly!

SECOND CHEATER 
Say you so? Then there's for you, and here's for me then.

[Throws meal in his face, takes his purse, and exit.]

SIMON 
Oh, bless me, neighbours, I am in a fog, 
A cheater's fog! I can see nobody!

GLOVER 
Run, follow him, officers!

[Exeunt Aminadab and officers.]

SIMON 
Away, let him go! He'll have all your purses, and he come back. A pox on your new additions! They spoil all the plays that ever they come in; the old way had no such roguery in't, I remember. Call you this a merry comedy, when as a man's eyes are put out? Brother Honeysuckle.

BRAZIER 
What says your sweet worship?

SIMON 
I make you my deputy to rule the town till I can see again, which I hope will be within nine days at furthest. Nothing grieves me but that I hear Oliver the rebel laugh at me. Pox on your puritan face! This will make you in love with plays ever hereafter; we shall not keep you from 'em now.

OLIVER 
In sincerity, I was never better edify'd at an exercise.

SIMON 
Neighbours, what colour is the rascal's dust he threw in my face?

GLOVER 
'Tis meal, an't please your worship.

SIMON 
Meal? I'm glad on't; I'll hang the miller for selling on't.

GLOVER 
Nay, ten to one the cheater never bought it; 
He stole it certainly.

SIMON 
Why, then I'll hang the cheater for stealing on't, and the miller for being out of the way when he did it.

FELLMONGER 
Ay, but your worship was in the fault yourself; 
You bade him do his worst.

SIMON 
His worst? That's true, 
But he has done his best, the rascal, for I know not how a villain could put out a man's eyes better, and leave 'em in's head, than he has done.

Enter clerk [Aminadab].

[AMINADAB] 
Where's my master's worship?

SIMON 
How now, Aminadab? I hear thee though I see thee not.

[AMINADAB] 
Y'are sure cozen'd, sir; they are all cheaters professed! They have stol'n three silver spoons too, and the clown took his heels with all celerity; they only take the name of country comedians to abuse simple people with a printed play or two they bought at Canterbury last week for sixpence, and which is worst, they speak but what they list on't and fribble out the rest.

SIMON 
Here's no abuse to th' commonwealth, 
If a man could see to look into't! 
But mark the cunning of these cheating slaves: 
First they make justice blind, then play the knaves.

Enter Hengist.

GLOVER 
'Od's precious brother, the King of Kent's new lighted!

SIMON 
The King of Kent? Where is he, where is he? 
Oh, that I should live to this day, and yet 
Not live to see to bid him welcome!

HENGIST 
Now where's Simonides, our friendly host?

SIMON 
As blind as one that had been fox'd a [se'nnight].

HENGIST 
Why, how now, man?

SIMON 
Faith, practising a clown's part for your grace 
I have practis'd both mine eyes out.

HENGIST 
What need you practise that?

SIMON 
A man's never too old to learn; your grace will say so when you hear all the villainy. The truth 'tis, my lord, I meant to have been merry, and now 'tis my luck to weep water and oatmeal; but I shall see again at supper-time, I make no doubt on't.

HENGIST 
This is strange to me, sirs.

Enter Gentleman [Saxon].

GENTLEMAN [SAXON] 
Arm, arm, my lord--

HENGIST 
What's that?

GENTLEMAN [SAXON] 
With swiftest speed, 
If ever you'll behold the queen your daughter 
Alive again!

HENGIST 
Roxena!

GENTLEMAN [SAXON] 
They're besieg'd, 
Aurelius Ambrose and his brother Uther, 
With numbers infinite in Britain forces, 
Beset their castle, and they cannot 'scape 
Without your speedy succour.

HENGIST 
For her safety 
I'll forget food and rest. Away!

SIMON 
I hope 
Your grace will hear the jest afore you go.

HENGIST 
The jest! Torment me not. Set forward!

SIMON 
I'll follow you 
To Wales with a dog and a bell, but I'll tell't you.

HENGIST 
Unreasonable folly!

Exit [with Gentleman Saxon].

SIMON 
'Tis sign of war when great ones disagree; 
Look to the rebel well till I can see, 
And when my sight's recover'd, 
I'll have his eyes put out for a fortnight.

OLIVER 
Hang thee! Mine eyes! A deadly sin or two 
Shall pluck 'em out first, that's my resolution.

Exeunt omnes.


[V.ii. Before a castle in Wales]
Enter Aurelius and Uther with soldiers.

UTHER 
My lord, the castle is so fortify'd--

AURELIUS 
So fortify'd? Let wildfire ruin it, 
That his destruction may appear to him 
I' th' figure of heaven's wrath at the last day, 
That murtherer of our brother! Haste away; 
I'll send my heart no peace till 't be consum'd.

Vortiger, Horsus on the walls.

UTHER 
There he appears again; behold, my lord.

AURELIUS 
Oh, that the zealous fire on my soul's altar, 
To the high birth of virtue consecrated, 
Would fit me with a [lightning] now to blast him 
Even as I look upon him!

UTHER 
Good my lord, 
Your anger is too noble and too precious 
To waste [itself] on guilt so foul as his; 
Let ruin work her will.

VORTIGER 
Begirt all round?

HORSUS 
All, all, my lord, 'tis folly to make doubt on't; 
You question things that horror long agone 
Resolv'd us on.

VORTIGER 
Give me leave, Horsus, though--

HORSUS 
Do what you will, sir; question 'em again, 
I'll tell 'em over to you.

VORTIGER 
Not so, sir; 
I will not have 'em told again.

HORSUS 
It rests then.

VORTIGER 
That's an ill word put in, when thy heart knows 
There is no rest at all but torment-making.

HORSUS 
True, my heart finds it, that sits weeping blood now 
For poor Roxena's safety. You'll confess, my lord, 
My love to you has brought me to this danger? 
I could have liv'd like Hengist, King of Kent, 
And London, York, Lincoln, and Winchester 
Under the power of my command, the portion 
Of my most [just] desert; it fell to't, enjoy'd now 
By lesser deservers.

VORTIGER 
Say you so, sir, 
And you'll confess? Since you begin confession, 
A thing I should have died before I'd thought on: 
I'm out of your love's debt; i' th' [same] condition, 
Y'have marred the fashion of your affection utterly 
In your own wicked counsel. There you paid me; 
You could not but in conscience love me afterward. 
You were bound to do't, as men in honesty 
That vitiate virgins to give dowries to 'em: 
My faith was pure before to faithful woman.

HORSUS 
My lord, my counsel--

VORTIGER 
'Tis the map now spread 
That shows me all my miseries and discovers 
Strange newfound ruin to me; all these objects 
That in a dangerous ring circle my safety 
Are yours and of your fashioning.

HORSUS 
Death mine! 
Extremity breeds the wildness of a desert 
Into your soul, and since y'have lost your thankfulness, 
Which is the noblest part in king or subject: 
My counsel do't!

VORTIGER 
Why, I'll be judg'd by those 
That knit [death] in their brows, and think me now 
Not worthy the acception of a flattery; 
Most of those faces smil'd when I smil'd once. 
My lords!

UTHER 
Reply not, brother.

VORTIGER 
Seeds of scorn, 
I mind you not; I speak to those alone 
Whose force makes yours a power, which else were none. 
Show me the main food of your hate, my lords, 
Which cannot be the murder of Constantius 
That crawls in [your] revenges, for your love 
Was violent long since that.

GENTLEMAN 
And had been still, 
If from that [pagan] woman thou'dst slept free; 
But when thou fledd'st from heaven, we fled from thee.

VORTIGER 
[To Horsus] Was this your counsel now?

HORSUS 
Mine? 'Twas the counsel 
Of your own lust and blood; your appetite knows it.

VORTIGER 
May thunder strike me from these walls, my lords, 
And leave me many leagues off from your eyes, 
If this be not the man whose Stygian soul 
Breath'd forth that counsel to me, and sole plotter 
Of all these false, injurious disgraces 
That have abus'd the virtuous patience 
Of our religious queen.

HORSUS 
A devil in madness!

VORTIGER 
Upon whose life, I swear, there sticks no stain 
But what's most wrongful, and where now she thinks 
A rape dwells on her honour, only I 
Her ravisher was, and his the policy.

AURELIUS 
Inhuman practice!

VORTIGER 
Now you know the truth, 
Will his death serve your fury?

HORSUS 
Mine? My death?

VORTIGER 
Will't do't?

HORSUS 
What if it would?

VORTIGER 
Say, will it do't?

HORSUS 
Say they should say it would.

VORTIGER 
Why, then it must.

HORSUS 
It must?

VORTIGER 
It shall; speak but the words, my lord, 
He shall be yielded up.

HORSUS 
I yielded up? 
My lords, believe him not; he cannot do't.

VORTIGER 
Cannot?

HORSUS 
'Tis but a false and base insinuation 
For his own life, and like his late submission.

VORTIGER 
Oh, sting to honour, alive or dead thou goest 
For that word's rudeness only!

[Stabs him.]

GENTLEMAN 
See, sin needs 
No more destruction than it breeds 
In [its] own bosom.

VORTIGER 
Such another brings him.

HORSUS 
What, has thy wild rage stamp'd a wound upon me? 
I'll send one to thy soul shall never heal for't.

VORTIGER 
How, to my soul?

HORSUS 
It shall be thy master torment 
Both for the pain and the everlastingness.

VORTIGER 
Ha, ha!

HORSUS 
Dost laugh? Take leave on't; all eternity 
Shall never see thee do so much again: 
Know thou art a cuckold.

VORTIGER 
What!

HORSUS 
You change too soon, sir. 
Roxena, whom th'ast rais'd to thine own ruin, 
She was my whore in Germany.

VORTIGER 
Burst me open, 
You violence [of] whirlwinds!

HORSUS 
Hear me out first: 
For her embrace, which yet my flesh sits warm in, 
I was thy friend and follower.

VORTIGER 
Deafen me, 
Thou most imperious noise that starts the world!

HORSUS 
And to serve [both] our lust[s] I practis'd with thee 
Against thy virtuous queen--

VORTIGER 
Bane to all comforts!

HORSUS 
Whose faithful sweetness, too precious for thy blood, 
I made thee change for love's hypocrisy.

VORTIGER 
Insufferable!

HORSUS 
Only to make my way to pleasure fearless, 
Free and fluent.

VORTIGER 
Hell's trump is in that throat!

HORSUS 
It shall sound shriller.

VORTIGER 
I'll dam it up with death first.

[They stab each other.]

I am at thy heart, I hope!

HORSUS 
Hold out breath 
And I shall find thee quickly.

[Roxena enters in fear.]

ROXENA 
Oh, for succour! 
Who's near me? Help me, save [me], the flame follows me! 
It's the figure of poor [Vortimer] the prince, 
Whose life I took by poison.

VORTIGER 
I'll tug out 
Thy soul here.

HORSUS 
Do, monster!

ROXENA 
Vortiger!

VORTIGER 
Monster!

ROXENA 
My lord!

VORTIGER 
Slave!

ROXENA 
Horsus, Horsus!

HORSUS 
Murderer!

ROXENA 
My lord!

VORTIGER 
Toad, pagan!

HORSUS 
Viper, Christian!

ROXENA 
Hear me, help me! 
My love, my lord, I'm scorch'd! What, all in blood? 
Oh, happy men, that ebb shows you're near falling. 
Have you chose that way yourselves rather to die 
By your own swords than feel fire's keener torment 
And will not kill me that most needs that pity? 
Captain, my lord, send me some speedier death 
And one less painful; I have a woman's sufferings. 
Oh, think upon't! Go not away so easily 
And leave the harder conflict to my weakness. 
Most wretched! I'm not worth so much destruction 
As would destroy me quickly. And turn back? 
I cannot. Oh, 'tis here, my lord, 'tis here! 
Horsus, look up, if not to succour me, 
To see me yet consum'd. Oh, what is love 
When life is not regarded?

VORTIGER 
What strength's left 
I'll fix upon thy throat.

HORSUS 
I have some force yet.

[Both stab, Horsus falls.]

ROXENA 
No way to 'scape? Is this the end of glory? 
Doubly beset with enemy's wrath and fire! 
See, for an arm of lust, I'm now embrac'd 
With one that will destroy me, where I read 
The horror of dishonest actions, guile, 
And dissemblance. It comes nearer now, rivers 
And fountains fall; tears were now a blessing. 
It sucks away my breath; I cannot give 
A curse to sin and hear't out while I live. 
Oh, help, help, help!

[She falls.]

VORTIGER 
Burn, burn; now I can tend thee. 
Take time with her in torments, call her life 
Afar off to thee, dry up her strumpet blood 
And hardly parch the skin; let one heat strangle her, 
Another fetch her to her sense again, 
And the worst pain be only her reviving! 
Follow her eternally; give her not o'er 
But in a bitter shape. I shall be cold 
Before thy rage reach me. Oh, mystical harlot! 
Thou hast thy full due, whom lust crown'd queen before 
Flames crown her [now] for a triumphant whore, 
And that end crowns 'em all.

Falls.

AURELIUS 
Our peace is full now 
In yon usurper's fall, nor have I known 
A judgment meet more fearfully. 
Here, take this ring, deliver the good queen 
And those grave pledges of her injur'd honour, 
Her worthy father and her noble uncle, 
Too long, too much abus'd, whose clear-ey'd fames 
I reverence with respect to holiness due, 
A spotless name being sanctity now in few.

[Trumpets sound.]

How now, my lords! The meaning of these sounds?

[Enter] Devonshire, Stafford, leading Hengist prisoner.

HENGIST 
The consumer has been here; she's gone, she's lost, 
In glowing cinders now lie all my joys! 
The headlong fortune of my rash captivity 
Strikes not so fierce a wound into my hopes 
As thy dear loss.

AURELIUS 
Her father and her uncle!

GENTLEMAN 
They are indeed, my lord.

AURELIUS 
Part of my wishes. 
What fortunate power has prevented me 
And, ere my love came, brought 'em victory?

GENTLEMAN 
My wonder sticks in Hengist, King of Kent.

DEVONSHIRE 
My lord, to make that plain which now I see 
Fix'd in astonishment: the only name 
Of your return and being brought such gladness 
To this distracted kingdom, that, to express 
A thankfulness to heaven, it grew great 
In charitable actions, from which goodness 
We tasted liberty that lay engag'd 
Upon the innocence of woman's honour, 
A kindness that even threat'ned to undo us; 
And having newly but enjoy'd the benefit 
And fruits of our enlargement, 'twas our happiness 
To intercept this monster of ambition, 
Bred in these times of usurpation, 
The rankness of whose insolence and treason 
Grew to such height, 'twas arm'd to bid you battle, 
Whom, as our fames' redemption, on our knees 
We present captiv'd.

AURELIUS 
Had it needed reason 
You rightly came provided. What is he?

GENTLEMAN 
My lord, that treacherous Hengist, King of Kent.

AURELIUS 
I understand not your desert till now, my lords. 
Is this that German Saxon whose least thirst 
Could not be satisfied under a province?

HENGIST 
Had but my fate directed this bold arm 
To thy life, the whole kingdom had been mine, 
That was my hope's great aim; I have a thirst 
Could never have been full quench'd under all: 
The whole land must, or nothing.

AURELIUS 
A strange drouth! 
And what a little ground shall death now teach you 
To be content withal!

HENGIST 
Why, let it then, 
For none else can; y'have nam'd the only way: 
When I'm content, it must be when I'm clay.

AURELIUS 
My lords, the best requital yet we give you 
Is a fair inward joy. Speak to your fames 
Glories unblemish'd, for the queen your daughter 
Lives firm in honour, neither by consent 
Or act [of] violence stain'd, as her grief judges; 
'Twas her own lord abus'd her honest fear, 
Whose ends sham'd him, only to make her clear.

DEVONSHIRE 
Had your grace given a kingdom for a gift 
[It] had not been so welcome.

Enter Castiza, a Gentleman.

AURELIUS 
Here she comes 
Whose virtues I must reverence.

CASTIZA 
[Kneeling] Oh, my lord, 
I kneel a wretched woman.

AURELIUS 
[Raising her] Arise with me, 
Great in true joy and honour.

HENGIST 
This sight splits me; 
It brings Roxena's ruin to my memory.

CASTIZA 
My lord, it is too great a joy for life.

AURELIUS 
'Tis truth, and that I know you ever joy'd in, 
His end confess'd it.

CASTIZA 
Are you return'd, soul's comforts?

AURELIUS 
Nay, to approve thy pureness to posterity, 
The fruitful hopes of a fair, peaceful kingdom 
Here will I plant.

CASTIZA 
Too worthless are my merits.

AURELIUS 
There speaks thy modesty, and to the firmness 
Of truth's plantation in this land forever, 
Which always groans under some curse without it, 
As I begin my rule with the destruction 
Of this ambitious pagan, so shall all 
With his adulterate faith distain'd and soil'd 
Either turn Christians, die, or live exil'd.

OMNES 
A blessing on those virtues!

Flourish. Exeunt.


[Chorus v.]
Enter Raynulph.

[RAYNULPH] 
For story of truth compact 
I choose these times, these men to act, 
As careful now to make you glad 
As this were the first day they play'd; 
And though some that give none their due 
Please to mistake 'em, do not you, 
Whose censures have been ever kind: 
We hope 'tis good, but if we find 
Your grace and love by pleas'd signs understood, 
We cease to hope, for then we know 'tis good.

Exit. Music.
