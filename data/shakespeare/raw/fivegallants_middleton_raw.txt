INDUCTION
Presenter, or Prologue, passing over the stage; the bawd-gallant [Primero], with three wenches gallantly attired, meets him; the whore-gallant [Tailby], the pocket-gallant [Pursenet], the cheating-gallant [Goldstone], kiss these three wenches, and depart in a little whisper and wanton action. Now, for the other, the broker-gallant [Frippery], he sits at home yet, I warrant you, at this time of day, summing up his pawns. Hactenus quasi inductio, a little glimpse giving.

I.[i. A room in Frippery's house.]
[Frippery discovered summing up his pawns, one Fellow standing by him.] Enter a Second Fellow [led in by Arthur].

ARTHUR 
Is your pawn good and sound, sir?

SECOND FELLOW 
I'll pawn my life for that, sir.

ARTHUR 
Place yourself there then; I will seek to prefer it presently. My master is very jealous of the pestilence; marry, the pox sits at meat and meal with him.

[Second Fellow retires.]

FRIPPERY 
[Reads] "Lent the fifth day of September to Mistress Onset upon her gown [and] taffeta petticoat with three broad silver laces, three pound fifteen shillings. Lent to Justice Cropshin upon both his velvet jackets, five pound ten shillings. Lent privately to my Lady Newcut upon her gilt casting-bottle and her silver lie-pot, fifty-five shillings."

ARTHUR 
Sir--

FRIPPERY
[Reads] "Lent to Sir Oliver Needy upon his taffeta cloak, beaver hat, and perfumed leather-jerkin, six pound five shillings."

ARTHUR
May it please your worship--

FRIPPERY 
[Reads] "Lent to Master Andrew Lucifer upon his flame-coloured doublet and blue taffeta hose"--Top the candle, sirrah; methinks the light burns blue: when came that suit in?

ARTHUR 
'T'as lain above the year now.

FRIPPERY 
Fire and brimstone! Cut it out into matches; the white linings will serve for tinder.

ARTHUR 
And with little help, sir; they are almost black enough already. Sir, here's another come with a pawn.

FRIPPERY 
Keep him aside awhile, and reach me hither the bill of the last week.

ARTHUR 
'Tis here at hand, sir.

FRIPPERY 
Now, sir, what's your pawn?

FIRST FELLOW 
The second part of a gentlewoman's gown, sir; the lower half, I mean.

FRIPPERY 
I apprehend you easily, the breeches of the gown.

FIRST FELLOW
Very proper, for she wears the doublet at home; a guest that lies in my house, sir; she looks every hour for her cousin out a' th' country.

FRIPPERY 
O, her cousin lies here; 'a may mistake in that. My friend, of what parish is your pawn?

FIRST FELLOW
Parish? Why, Saint Clement's, sir.

FRIPPERY 
[To Second Fellow] I'll come to you presently. [To First Fellow] What parish is your pawn, my friend? [Reads] "Saint Bride's, five; Saint Dunstan's, none; Saint Clement's, three." Three at Clement's? Away with your pawn, sir, your parish is infected! I will neither purchase the plague for sixpence in the pound and a groat bill-money, nor venture my small stock into contagious parishes: you have your answer; fare you well, as fast as you can, sir.

FIRST FELLOW 
The pox arrest you, sir, at the suit of the suburbs!

FRIPPERY 
Ay, welcome, welcome.

FIRST FELLOW
For, I think, plague scorns your company.

Exit.

FRIPPERY 
I rank with chief gallants; I love to smell safely. [Reads] "Lent in the vacation to Master Proctor upon his spiritual gown five angels, and upon his corporal doublet fifteen shillings; sum, three pound five shillings."

ARTHUR 
Sir--

FRIPPERY 
Now, sir?

ARTHUR 
[Bringing forward a trunk] Here's one come in with a trunk of apparel.

FRIPPERY 
Whence comes it?

ARTHUR 
From Saint Martin's-in-the-Field.

FRIPPERY 
Saint Martin's-in-the-Field? [Reads] "Saint Mary Maudlin, two; Saint Martin's, none." Here's an honest fellow; let him appear, sir.

ARTHUR 
You may come near, sir.

FRIPPERY 
O welcome, welcome; what's your pawn, sir?

SECOND FELLOW 
Faith, a gentlewoman's whole suit, sir.

FRIPPERY 
Whole suit? 'Tis well.

SECOND FELLOW
A poor, kind soul, troubled with a bad husband; one that puts her to her shifts here.

FRIPPERY 
He puts here from her shifts, methinks, when she is fain to pawn her clothes.

SECOND FELLOW 
Look you, sir; a fair satin gown, new taffeta petticoat--

FRIPPERY 
Stay, this petticoat has been turned.

SECOND FELLOW 
Often turned up and down, and you will, but never turned, sir.

FRIPPERY 
Cry you mercy, indeed.

SECOND FELLOW 
A fine white beaver, pearl band, three falls; I ha' known her have more in her days.

FRIPPERY 
Alas, and she be but a gentlewoman of any count or charge, three falls are nothing in these days! Know that: tut, the world's changed; [gentlewomen's] falls stand upright now; no sin but has a bolster, that it may lie at ease. Well, what do you borrow of these, sir?

SECOND FELLOW 
Twelve pounds, and you will, sir.

FRIPPERY 
How?

SECOND FELLOW 
They were not her's for twenty.

FRIPPERY 
Why, so; our pawn is ever thrice the value of our money, unless in plate and jewels; how should the months be restored and the use else? We must cast it for the twelvemonth, so many pounds, so many months, so many eighteenpences; then the use of these eighteenpences; then the want of the return of those pounds: all these must be laid together; which well considered, the valuation of the pawn had need to sound treble. Can six pound pleasure the gentlewoman?

SECOND FELLOW 
It may please her, but, like a man of three-score, in the limberest degree.

FRIPPERY 
I have but one word more to say in't; twenty nobles is all and the utmost that I will hazard upon't.

SECOND FELLOW 
She must be content with't: the less borrowed, the better paid; come.

FRIPPERY 
Arthur.

ARTHUR 
At hand, sir.

FRIPPERY 
Tell out twenty nobles, and take her name in a bill.

SECOND FELLOW 
I'm satisfied, sir.

[Exit with Arthur.]

FRIPPERY 
Welcome, good Saint Martin's-in-the-Field, welcome, welcome! I know no other name.

Enter Primero.

PRIMERO 
What, so hard at your prayers?

FRIPPERY 
A little, sir; summing up my pawns here--what, Master Primero, is it you, sir gallant? And how does all the pretty, sweet ladies, those plump, kind, delicate blisses, ha? whom I kiss in my very thoughts? How do they, gallant?

PRIMERO 
Why, gallant, if they should not do well in my house, where should it be done, boy? Have I not a glorious situation?

FRIPPERY 
O, a gallant receipt: violet air, curious garden, quaint walks, fantastical arbours, three back doors, and a coach-gate! Nay, thou'rt admirably seated: little furniture will serve thee; thou'rt never without moveables.

PRIMERO 
Ay, praise my stars! Ah, the goodly virginities that have been cut up in my house, and the goodly patrimonies that have lain like sops in the gravy! And when those sops were eaten, yet the meat was kept whole for another, and another, and another; for as in one pie twenty may dip their sippits, so upon one woman forty may consume their patrimonies.

FRIPPERY 
Excellent, Master Primero!

PRIMERO 
Well, I'll pray for women while I live; 
They're the profitablest fools, I'll say that for 'em, 
A man can keep about his house; the prettiest kind fowl, 
So tame, so gentle, e'en to strangers' hands 
So soon familiar, suffer to be touch'd 
Of those they ne'er saw twice: the dove's not like 'em.

FRIPPERY 
Most certain, for that's honest: but I have 
A suit to you.

PRIMERO 
And so have I to you.

FRIPPERY 
That happens well: grant mine, and I'll grant yours.

PRIMERO 
A match.

FRIPPERY 
Make me perfect in that trick that got you so much at primero.

PRIMERO 
O, for the thread tied at your partner's leg, 
The twitch?

FRIPPERY 
Ay, that twitch and you call't so.

PRIMERO 
That secret twitch got me five hundred pound 
Ere 'twas first known, and since I ha' sold it well: 
Five hundred pound laid down shall not yet buy 
The fee-simple of my twitch: I would be here with't. 
'Twas a best invention; 
I'd been a beggar many a lousy year 
But for my twitch: it was the prettiest twitch! 
Many over-cheated gulls have fatted 
Me with the bottom of their patrimonies, 
E'en to the last sop, gaped while I fed 'em, 
Who now live by that art that first undid 'em, 
But I must swear you to be secret, close.

FRIPPERY 
As a maid at ten.

PRIMERO 
Had you sworn but two years higher 
I would ne'er ha' believ'd you.

FRIPPERY 
Nay, I let twelve alone, 
For after twelve has struck, maids look for one.

PRIMERO 
I look for one too, and a maid, I think.

FRIPPERY 
What, to come hither?

PRIMERO 
Sure, she follows me: 
A pretty, fat-eyed wench, with a Venus in her cheek; did but raiment smile upon her, she were nectar for great dons, boy: and that's my suit to thee.

FRIPPERY 
And that's granted already. Of what volume is this book, that I may fit a cover to't?

PRIMERO 
Faith, neither in folio nor in decimo sexto, but in octavo, between both; a pretty, middle-sized trug.

FRIPPERY 
Then I have fitted her already, in my eye, i'faith. Here came a pawn in e'en now will make shift to serve her as fit! Look you, sir [gallant]: satin, taffeta, beaver, fall, and all.

PRIMERO 
Is it new?

FRIPPERY 
New? You see it bears her youth as freshly.

PRIMERO 
A pretty suit of clothes, i'faith: but put case the party should come to redeem 'em of a sudden?

FRIPPERY 
Pooh, then your wit's sickly: have not I the policy, think you, to seem extreme busy, and defer 'em till the morrow? Against which time that pawn shall be secretly fetched home, and another carried out to supply the place.

PRIMERO 
I like thy craft well there.
FRIPPERY 
A general course. O, frippery is an unknown benefit, sir gallant! 
PRIMERO 
And what must I give you for the hire now, i'faith?
FRIPPERY 
Of the whole suit, for the month?
PRIMERO 
Ay, for the month.
FRIPPERY 
Go to, you shall give me but twelvepence a-day; Master Primero, you're a friend, and I'll use you so: 'tis got up at your house in an afternoon, i'faith, the hire of the whole month. Ye must think I can distinguish spirits, and put a difference between you and others; you pay no more, i'faith.

PRIMERO 
I could have offered you no less myself.

FRIPPERY 
Tut, a man must use a friend as a friend may use him: your house has been a sweet house to me, both for pleasure and profit; I'll give you your due: omne tulit punctum, you have always kept fine punks in your house, that's for pleasure, qui miscuit utile dulci, and I have had sweet pawns from 'em, that's for profit now.

PRIMERO 
You flatter, you flatter, sir gallant. But whist! Here she enters: I prithee, question her.

Enter Novice.

O, you're welcome!

FRIPPERY 
Is this your new scholar, Master Primero?

PRIMERO 
Marry, is she, sir.

FRIPPERY 
I'll commend your judgment in a wench while I live: that face will get money, i'faith; 'twill be a get-penny, I warrant you. [To Novice] Go to, your fortune was choice, pretty bliss, to fall into the regard of so kind a gentleman.

NOVICE 
I hope so, sir.

FRIPPERY 
See what his care has provided already for you; you'll be simply set out to the world! If you'll have that care now to deserve his pains, O, that will be acceptable! And these be the rudiments you must chiefly point at: to counterfeit cunningly, to wind in gentlemen with powerful attraction to keep his house in name and custom, to dissemble with your own brother, never to betray your fellows' imperfections nor lay open the state of their bodies to strangers, to believe those that give you, to gull those that believe you, to laugh at all under taffeta; and these be your rudiments.

PRIMERO 
There's e'en all, i'faith; we'll trouble you with no more. Nay, you shall live at ease enough: for nimming away jewels and favours from gentlemen, which are your chief vails, [I] hope that will come naturally enough to you, I need not instruct you; you'll have that wit, I trust, to make the most of your pleasure.

NOVICE 
I hope one's mother-wit will serve for that, sir.

PRIMERO 
O, properest of all, wench! It must be a she-wit that does those things, and thy mother was quick enough at it in her days.

FRIPPERY 
Give me leave, sister, to examine you upon two or three particulars: and make you ready, be not ashamed; here's none but friends. Are you a maid?

NOVICE 
Yes, in the last quarter, sir.

FRIPPERY 
Very proper, that's e'en going out: a maid in the last quarter, that's a whore in the first. Let me see, new moon on Thursday; she'll be chan[g]ed by that time, too. Are you willing to pleasure gentlemen?

NOVICE 
We are all born to pleasure our country, forsooth.

FRIPPERY 
Excellent! Can you carry yourself cunningly, and seem often holy?

NOVICE 
O, fear not that, sir! My friends were all Puritans.

FRIPPERY 
I'll ne'er try her further.

PRIMERO 
She's done well, i'faith: I fear not now to turn her loose to any gentleman in Europe.

FRIPPERY 
You need not, sir: of her own accord, I think she'll be loose enough without turning. Arthur!

Enter Arthur.

ARTHUR 
Here, sir.

FRIPPERY 
Go, make haste, shift her into that suit presently.

ARTHUR 
It shall be done.

PRIMERO 
Arthur, do't neatly, Arthur.

ARTHUR 
Fear't not, sir.

PRIMERO 
Follow him, wench.

NOVICE 
With all my heart, sir.

[Exeunt Arthur and Novice.]

PRIMERO 
[But, mass, sir], 
In what are we forgetful all this while!

FRIPPERY 
In what?

PRIMERO 
The wooing business, man.

FRIPPERY 
Heart, that's true!

PRIMERO 
The gallants will prevent us.

FRIPPERY 
Are you certain?

PRIMERO 
I can avouch it: there's a general meeting 
At the deceas'd knight's house this afternoon; 
There's rivalship enough.

FRIPPERY 
No doubt in that: 
Would either thou or I might bear her from 'em!

PRIMERO 
My hopes are not yet faint.

FRIPPERY 
Nor mine.

PRIMERO 
Tut, man. 
Nothing in women's hearts sooner win[s] place 
Than a grave outside and an impudent face.

FRIPPERY 
And for both those we'll fit it.

PRIMERO 
Ay, if the devil 
Be not in't: make haste.

FRIPPERY 
I follow straight.

Exit Primero.

Vanish, thou fog, and sink beneath our brightness, 
Abashed at the splendour of such beams! 
We scorn thee, base eclipser of our glories, 
That wouldst have hid our shine from mortal's eyes. 
Now, gallants, I'm for you, ay, and perhaps before you: 
You can appear but glorious from yourselves, 
And have your beams but drawn from your own light, 
But mine from many: many make me bright. 
Here's a diamond that sometimes graced the finger of a countess; here sits a ruby that ne'er lins blushing for the party that pawned it; here a sapphire. O providence and fortune! My beginning was so poor, I would fain forget it; and I take the only course, for I scorn to think on't; slave to a trencher, observer of a salt-cellar, privy to nothing but a closestool, or such unsavoury secret[s]: but as I strive to forget the days of my serving, so I shall once remember the first step of my rising; for, having hardly raked five mark together, I rejoiced so in that small stock, which most providentially I ventured by water to Blackwall among fishwives; and in small time, what by weekly return and gainful restitution, it rize to a great body, beside a dish of fish for a present, that stately preserved me a seven-night. 
Nor ceas'd it there, but drew on greater profit; 
For I was held religious by those 
That do profess like abstinence, 
And was full often secretly supplied 
By charitable Catholics, 
Who censur'd me sincerely abstinate, 
When merely I for hunger, [not] for zeal, 
Eat up the fish, and put their alms to use! 
Ha, ha, ha! 
But those times are run out; and, for my sake, 
Zealous dissemblance has since far'd the worse. 
Let me see now, whose cloak shall I wear today to continue change? O Arthur!

Enter Arthur.

ARTHUR 
Here, sir.

FRIPPERY 
Bring down Sir Oliver Needy's taffeta cloak and beaver hat--I am sure he is fast enough [in the knight's ward]--and Andrew Lucifer's rapier and dagger with the embossed girdle and hangers,

[Exit Arthur.]

for he's in his third sweat by this time, sipping of the doctor's bottle, or picking the ninth part of a rack of mutton, dry-roasted, with a leash of nightcaps on his head like the pope's triple crown, and as many pillows crushed to his back, with, "O the needles!" For he got the pox of a sempster, and it pricked so much more naturally. Quick, Arthur, quick!

[Enter Arthur with the pawned items, which Frippery puts on.]

Now to the deceas'd knight's daughter, 
Whom many gallants sue to, I 'mongst many; 
For since impudence gains more respect than virtue, 
And coin [than] blood, which few can now deny, 
Who're your chief gallants then but such as I?

[Exeunt.]


[I.ii. A room in Katherine's house]
Enter Katherine and Fitsgrave.

FITSGRAVE 
You do your beauties injury, sweet virgin, 
To lose the time they must rejoice in youth: 
There's no perfection in a woman plac'd 
But wastes itself though it be never wasted; 
Then judge your wrongs yourself.

KATHERINE 
Good Master Fitsgrave, 
Through sorrow for the knight my father's death, 
Whose being was the [perfection] of my joy 
And crown of my desires, I cannot yet 
But forcedly on marriage fix my heart: 
Yet heaven forbid I should deject your hopes! 
Conceive not of me so uncharitably; 
I should belie my soul if I should say 
You are the man I never should affect. 
I understand you thus far, you're a gentleman, 
Whom your estate and virtues may command 
To a far worthier breast than this of mine.

FITSGRAVE 
O cease! I dare not hear such blasphemy. 
What is without you worthy I neglect; 
In you is plac'd the worth that I respect. 
Vouchsafe, unequall'd virgin, [to] accept 
This worthless favour from your servant's arm, 
The hallow'd beads, whereon I justly kept 
The true and perfect number of my sighs. 
Gives a chain of pearl.

KATHERINE 
Mine cannot equal yours, yet in exchange 
Accept and wear it for my sake.

Gives a jewel.

FITSGRAVE 
Even as my [life] I'll rate it.

Enter Goldstone, Pursenet, Tailby, Frippery, Primero, and Boy, at the farther door.

GOLDSTONE 
Heart! Fitsgrave in such bosom single-loves?

PURSENET 
So close and private with her!

TAILBY 
Observe 'em; he grows proud and bold.

FRIPPERY 
Why, was not this a general meeting?

PRIMERO 
By her own consent. Death, how I could taste his blood!

KATHERINE 
See, the gentlemen, 
At my request, do all present themselves.

GOLDSTONE 
Manifold blisses wait on her desire, 
Whose beauty and whose mind so many honour!

KATHERINE 
I take your wishes thankfully, kind gentlemen, 
All here assembled, over whose long suits 
I ne'er insulted; 
Nor, like that common sickness of our sex, 
Grew proud in the abundance of my suitors, 
Or number of the days they sued unto me. 
Dutiful sorrow for my father's death, 
Not wilful coyness, hath my hours detain'd 
So long in silence. 
I'm left to mine own choice: so much the more 
My care calls on me. If I err through love, 
'Tis I must chide myself; I cannot shift 
The fault unto my parents, they're at rest, 
And I shall sooner err through love than wealth.

GOLDSTONE 
Good!

PURSENET 
Excellent!

TAILBY 
That likes me well.

PRIMERO 
Hope still.

KATHERINE 
And my affections do pronounce you all 
Worthy their pure and most entire deserts: 
Yet they can choose but one; 
Nor do I dissuade any of his hopes, 
Because my heart is not yet thoroughly fix'd 
On marriage or the man, 
But crave the quiet respite of one month, 
The month unto this night; against which time 
I do invite you all to that election, 
Which, on my unstain'd faith and virgin promise, 
Shall light amongst no strangers, but yourselves. 
May this content you?

While she is speaking, the Boy steals from her the chain of pearl.

ALL 
Glad and content.

KATHERINE 
'Tis a good time to leave; 
Till then commend us to your gentlest thoughts.

Exit.

ALL 
Enough.

FITSGRAVE 
Ough!

The gallants look scurvily upon Fitsgrave, and he upon them. Exeunt Goldstone, Tailby, Frippery, and Primero. As Pursenet is going out, the Boy takes him into a corner.

BOY 
Hist, master, hist!

PURSENET 
Boy, how now?

BOY 
Look you, sir.

PURSENET 
Her chain of pearl?

BOY 
I sneck'd it away finely.

PURSENET 
Active boy, 
Thy master's best revenue, his life and soul! 
Thou keep'st 'em both together: whip away.

[Exit Boy.]

[Aside] Fall back, fall belly, I must be maintained: 
Hope is no purchase; 
Nor care I if I miss her. Why I rank 
In this design with gallants, there's full cause; 
Policy invites me to it : 
'Tis not for love, or for her sake alone; 
It keeps my state suspectless and unknown.

Exit.

FITSGRAVE 
Their looks run through and through me, and the stings 
Of their snake-hissing whispers pierc'd my hearing. 
They're mad she grac'd me with one private minute 
Above their fortunes: I've observed 'em often 
Most spitefully aspected toward my happiness, 
Beyond all others; but the cause I know not. 
A quiet month the virgin has enclos'd 
Unto herself; suitors stand without till then: 
In which space cunningly I'll wind myself 
Into their bosoms. I've bethought the shape; 
Some credulous scholar, easily infected 
With fashion, time, and humour: unto such 
Their deepest thoughts will, like to wanton fishes, 
Play above water, and be all parts seen: 
For since at me their envy pines, I'll see 
Whether their lives from touch of blame sit free.

Exit.


II.[i. A room in Primero's house]
Enter Primero, meeting Mistress Newcut.

PRIMERO 
Mistress Newcut, welcome: here will be choice of gallants for you anon.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Is all clear? May I venture? Am I not seen of the wicked?

PRIMERO 
Strange absurdity, that you should come into my house, and ask if you be not seen of the wicked! Push! I take't unkindly, i'faith: what think you of my house? 'Tis no such common receptacle.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Forgive me, sweet Master Primero: I can be content to have my pleasure as much as another, but I must have a care of my credit; I would not be seen anything else. My husband's at sea, and a woman shall have an ill report in this world, let her carry herself never so secretly; you know't, Master Primero. And what choice of gallants be they? Will they be proper gentlemen, think you?

PRIMERO 
Nay, sure they are as proper as they will be already.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
And I must have choice, you know; I come for no gain, but for sheer pleasure and affection.

PRIMERO 
You see your old spy-hole yonder; take your stand, please your own eye. I'll work it so, the gallants shall present themselves before you, and in the most conspicuous fashion.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
That's all I can desire [aside] till better come.--Look you.

PRIMERO 
What mean you, lady?

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
A trifle, sir, to buy you silver spurs. Good sir, accept it.

[Gives money and retires.]

PRIMERO 
Silver spurs? A pretty emblem! Mark it; all her gifts are about riding still: the other day she sent me boot-hose wrought in silk and gold; now silver spurs. Well, go thy ways, thou'rt as profitable a spirit as e'er lighted into my house. 
Come, ladies, come, 'tis late; to music. When?

Enter Courtesans and Novice.

FIRST COURTESAN 
You're best command us, sir! Our pimp's grown proud.

PRIMERO 
To fools and strangers these are gentlewomen 
Of sort and worship, knight's heirs, great in portions, 
Boarded here for their music; 
And oftentimes 't 'as been so cunningly carried, 
That I have had two stolen away at once, 
And married at Savoy, and prov'd honest shopkeepers: 
And I may safely swear they practis'd music; 
They're natural at prick-song. A small mist 
Will dazzle a fool's eye, and that's the world: 
So I can thump my hand upon the table 
With an austere grace, and cry, "One, two, and three," 
Fret, stamp, and curse, foh, 'twill pass well for me.

Enter Boy.

How now, sirrah?

BOY 
They're coming in, sir, and strangers in their company.

PRIMERO 
Tune apace, ladies. [To Boy] Be ready for the song, sirrah.

Enter Goldstone, Pursenet, Frippery, Tailby, Fitsgrave disguised, and Bungler.

GOLDSTONE 
Nay, I beseech you, gallants, be more inward with this gentleman; [his parts deserve it].

PURSENET 
Whence comes he, sir?

GOLDSTONE 
Piping hot from the university; he smells of buttered loaves yet; an excellent scholar, [aside] but the arrantest ass! [Presenting Bungler] For this our solicitor, he's a rare fellow five-and-forty mile hence, believe that: his friends are of the old fashion, all in their graves; and now has he the leisure to follow all new fashions, ply the brothels, practise salutes and cringes.

PURSENET 
O!

GOLDSTONE 
Now dear acquaintance, 
I'll bring you to see fashions.

FITSGRAVE 
What house is this, sir?

GOLDSTONE 
O, of great name: here music is profess'd; 
Here sometimes ladies practise, and the meanest, 
Daughters to men of worship, 
Whom gentlemen, such as ourselves, may visit, 
Court, clip, and exercise our wits upon; 
It is a profess'd courtesy.

FITSGRAVE 
A pretty recreation, i'faith!

GOLDSTONE 
I seldom saw so few here: you shall have 'em sometimes in every corner of the house, with their viols betwixt their legs, and play the sweetest strokes; 'twould e'en filch your soul almost out of your bosom.

FITSGRAVE 
Pax on't, we spoil ourselves for want of these things at university.

GOLDSTONE 
You have no such natural happiness: let's draw near.

PRIMERO 
Gentlemen, you are all most respectively welcome.

GOLDSTONE 
We are bold and insatiate suitors, sir, to the breath of your music, and the dear sight of those ladies.

PRIMERO 
And what our poor skill can invite you to, 
You're kindly welcome: you must pardon 'em, gentlemen, 
Virgins and bashful, besides new beginners: 
'Tis not a whole month since they were first enter'd.

GOLDSTONE 
[Aside] Seven year in my knowledge.

PRIMERO 
They blush at their very lessons; they'll not endure 
To hear of a stop, a prick, or a semiquaver.

FIRST COURTESAN 
O, out upon you !

PRIMERO 
La, I tell you. You'll bear me witness, gentlemen, 
If their complaints come to their parents' ears, 
They're words of art I teach 'em, nought but art.

GOLDSTONE 
Why, 'tis most certain.

BUNGLER 
For all scholars know that musica est ars.

ALL THE COURTESANS 
O, beastly word!

PRIMERO 
Look to the ladies, gentlemen.

GOLDSTONE 
Kiss again.

PURSENET 
Come, another.

TAILBY 
This a good interim.

[Exit.]

PRIMERO 
What have you done, sir?

BUNGLER 
Why, what have I done?

PRIMERO 
Saw you their stomachs queasy, and come with such gross meat?

BUNGLER 
Why, is't not Latin, sir?

PRIMERO 
Latin? Why, then, let the next to't be Latin too.

PURSENET 
So, enough.

GOLDSTONE 
Nay, I can assure you thus far, I that never knew the language have heard so much that ars is Latin for art; and it may well be, too, for there's more art in't nowadays than ever was.

PRIMERO 
Is't possible? 
I'm sorry then I've followed it so far.

FIRST COURTESAN 
A scholar call you him?

PRIMERO 
Music must not jar: 
The offence is satisfied. Come, to the song; 
Begin, sir.

The song; and he keeps time, shows several humours and moods: the boy in his pocket nims away Fitsgrave's jewel here, and exit.

BUNGLER 
Not a whole month since you were entered, ladies?

FITSGRAVE 
[Aside] None that shall see their cunning will believe it.

PRIMERO 
It is no affliction, gentlemen.

BUNGLER 
I care not much, i'faith, if I write down to my father presently to send up my sister in all haste that I may place her here at this music-school.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
[Looking in] 'Slid, 'tis the fool my cousin! I would not for the value of three recreations he had seen me here.

PRIMERO 
How like you your new prize?

BUNGLER 
Pray, give me leave; 
I have not yet sufficiently admir'd her.

PRIMERO 
My wits must not stand idle. 'Slife, he's in a sick trance!

GOLDSTONE 
[Aside] A cheat or two among these mistresses 
Would not be ill bestow'd; I affect none, 
But for my prey: such are their affections, 
I know it; how could drabs and cheaters live else? 
Then since the world rolls on dissimulation, 
I'll be the first dissembler.

FIRST COURTESAN 
Prithee, love, comfort, choice, 
My only wish, in thee I am confin'd! 
Deny me anything, a slight chain of pearl?

PURSENET 
Nay, an't be but slight--

FIRST COURTESAN 
Being denied, 
I prize it slight; but given me by my love, 
Light shall not be so dear unto my eye, 
Mine eye unto the body, as the gift.

PURSENET 
How have I power to deny this to you, 
That command all? My fortunes are thy servants, 
And thou the mistress both of them and me.

Gives her the chain.

FIRST COURTESAN 
The truest that e'er breathed!

GOLDSTONE 
To a gentleman 
That thus so long has so sincerely lov'd you 
As I myself, ne'er was less pity shown.

SECOND COURTESAN 
Why, I never was held cruel.

GOLDSTONE 
But to me.

SECOND COURTESAN 
Nor to you.

GOLDSTONE 
Go to, 't 'as scar'd you much.

SECOND COURTESAN 
I'm sorry your conceit is so unkind 
To think me so.

GOLDSTONE 
When had I other argument? 
I've often tender'd you my love and service, 
And that in no mean fashion; 
Yet were you ne'er that requiteful mistress 
That grac'd me with one favour; 
'Slight, not so much as such a pretty ring; 
Pax on't, 't'as almost broke my heart.

Takes off her ring.

SECOND COURTESAN 
Has took it off! 'Sfoot, Master [Goldstone]!

GOLDSTONE 
Nay, where a man loves most, there to be scanted!

SECOND COURTESAN 
My ring, come, come--

GOLDSTONE 
What reckon I a satin gown or two, 
If she were wise?

SECOND COURTESAN 
Life! My ring, sir, come--

GOLDSTONE 
Have you the face, i'faith?

SECOND COURTESAN 
Give me my ring.

GOLDSTONE 
Prithee, hence; by this light you get none on't.

SECOND COURTESAN 
How?

GOLDSTONE 
I hold your favours of more pure esteem, 
Than to part from 'em; faith, I do, howe'er 
You think of me.

SECOND COURTESAN 
Push, pray, sir--

GOLDSTONE 
Hark you, go to; 
You've lost much by unkindness; go your ways.

SECOND COURTESAN 
'Sfoot!

GOLDSTONE 
But yet there's no time past; you may redeem it.

SECOND COURTESAN 
Come, I cannot miss it, i' faith; beside, 
The gentleman that bestowed it on me 
Swore to me it cost him twenty nobles.

GOLDSTONE 
Twenty nobles? Pox of twenty nobles! 
But you must cost me more, you pretty villain: 
Ah, you little rogue!

SECOND COURTESAN 
Come, come, I know you're but in jest.

GOLDSTONE 
In jest? No, you shall see.

SECOND COURTESAN 
No way will get it: 
[Aside] As good give it him now, and hope for somewhat.

GOLDSTONE 
True love made jest!

SECOND COURTESAN 
I did but try thy faith, 
How fast thou'dst hold it. Now I see a woman 
May venture worthy favours to thy trust, 
And have 'em truly kept; and I protest, 
Had I drawn't from thee, I should ne'er ha' lov'd thee; 
I know that.

GOLDSTONE 
'Sfoot, I was ne'er so wronged in my life! 
Think you I'm in jest with you? What, with my love? 
I could find lighter subjects, you shall see; 
And time will show how much you injure me.

SECOND COURTESAN 
The ring, were it thrice worth, I freely give, 
For I know you'll requite it.

GOLDSTONE 
Will I live?

SECOND COURTESAN 
Enough.

GOLDSTONE 
[Aside] Why, this was well come off now: 
Where's my old serving-man? Not yet return'd? 
O, here he peeps.

Enter Fulk.

Now, sirrah?

FULK 
May it please your worship: they're done artificially, i'faith, boy.

GOLDSTONE 
Both the great beakers?

FULK 
Both, lad.

GOLDSTONE 
Just the same size?

FULK 
Ay, and the marks as just.

GOLDSTONE 
So, fall off respectively now.

FULK 
My lord desires your worship of all love--

GOLDSTONE 
His lordship must hold me excused till morning; I'll not break company tonight. Where sup we, gallants?

PURSENET 
At Mermaid.

GOLDSTONE 
Sup there who list, I have forsworn the house.

FULK 
[Aside] For the truth is, this plot must take effect at Mitre.

Exit.

[PURSENET] 
Faith, I'm indifferent.

BUNGLER 
So are we, gentlemen.

PURSENET 
Name the place, Master Goldstone.

GOLDSTONE 
Why, the Mitre, in my mind, for neat attendance, diligent boys, and, push, excels it far!

ALL 
Agreed, the Mitre then.

[PURSENET] 
Boy! [Aside] Some goodness toward: the boy's whipped away.

FITSGRAVE 
The jewel, heart, the jewel!

GOLDSTONE 
How now, sir? What mov'd you?

FITSGRAVE 
Nothing, sir; 
A spice of poetry, a kind a' fury, 
A disease runs among scholars.

GOLDSTONE 
Mass, it made you stamp.

FITSGRAVE 
Whew, 
'Twill make some stamp and stare, make a strange noise, 
Curse, swear, beat tire-men, and kick players' boys; 
The effects are very fearful.

PURSENET 
Bless me from't!

FITSGRAVE 
O, you need not fear it, sir. [Aside] Hell of this luck!

GOLDSTONE 
Hark, he's at it again!

PURSENET 
Some pageant-plot, 
Or some device for the tilt-yard: disturb him not.

FITSGRAVE 
[Aside] How can I gain her love, when I have lost her favour?

[GOLDSTONE] 
What money hast about thee? [Look you, sir, I must be fain to pawn a fair stone here for ordinary expenses: a pox of my tenants! I give 'em twenty days after the quarter, and they cut out forty.]

FRIPPERY 
Why, you might take the forfeiture of their leases then.

GOLDSTONE 
I know I might; but what's their course? The rogues come me up all together, with geese and capons, and petitions in pigs' snouts, which would move any man, i'faith, were his stomach ne'er so great; and to see how pitifully the pullen will look, it makes me after relent, and turn my anger into a quick fire to roast 'em--nay, touch't and spare it not.

FRIPPERY 
'Tis right: well, what does your worship borrow of this, sir?

GOLDSTONE 
The stone's twenty nobles.

FRIPPERY 
Nay, hardly.

GOLDSTONE 
As I am a right gentleman.

FRIPPERY 
It comes near it indeed: well, here's five pound in gold upon't.

GOLDSTONE 
'Twill serve; and the ring safe and secret?

FRIPPERY 
As a virgin's.

GOLDSTONE 
I wish no higher. What, gallants, are you constant? Does the place hold?

ALL 
The Mitre.

GOLDSTONE 
Sir, in regard of our continued boldness and trouble, which love to your music hath made us guilty of, shall we entreat your worship's company, with these sweet ladies, your professed scholars, to take part of a poor supper with myself and these gentlemen at the Mitre?

FRIPPERY 
Pray, Master Primero.

PURSENET 
I beseech you, sir, let it be so.

PRIMERO 
O, pardon me, sweet gentlemen; the world's apt to censure. I have the charge of them, they're left in trust, they're virgins: and I dare not hazard their fames; the least touch mars 'em: and what would their right worshipful parents think, if the report should fly to them, that they were seen with gentlemen in a tavern?

GOLDSTONE 
All this may be prevented: what serves your coach for? 
They may come coach'd and mask'd.

PRIMERO 
You put me to't, sir; 
Yet I must say again, I fear the drawers 
And vintner's boys will be familiar with them, 
And think 'em mistresses.

PURSENET 
There are those places where respect seems slighter; 
More censure is belonging to the Mitre? 
You know that, sir.

PRIMERO 
Gentlemen, you prevail.

GOLDSTONE 
We'll all expect you there.

PRIMERO 
And we'll not fail.

FITSGRAVE 
The devil will ne'er dissemble with them so, 
As you for them.

GOLDSTONE 
Come, sir.

FRIPPERY 
What else? Let's go.

Exeunt [all except Primero, Courtesans and Novice]. Enter Tailby.

PRIMERO 
How cheer you, sir?

TAILBY 
Faith, like the moon, more bright, 
Decreas'd in body, but re-made in light; 
Here thou shalt share some of my brightness with me.

[Gives Primero gold.]

PRIMERO 
By my faith, they're comfortable beams, sir.

FIRST COURTESAN 
Come, 
Where have you spent the time now from my sight? 
I'm jealous of thy action.

TAILBY 
Push! I did but walk 
A turn or two in the garden.

FIRST COURTESAN 
What made you there?

TAILBY 
Nothing but cropp'd a flower.

FIRST COURTESAN 
Some woman's honour, I believe.

TAILBY 
[Showing her a flower] Foh! Is this a woman's honour?

FIRST COURTESAN 
Much about one, 
When both are pluck'd, their sweetness is soon gone.

TAILBY 
Prithee, be true to me.

FIRST COURTESAN 
When did I fail?

TAILBY 
Yet I am ever doubtful that [you] sin.

FIRST COURTESAN 
I do account the world but as my spoil, 
To adorn thee: 
My love is artificial to all others, 
But purity to thee. Dost thou want gold? 
Here, take this chain of pearl, supply thyself: 
Be thou but constant, firm, and just to me, 
Rich heirs shall want ere want come near to thee.

TAILBY 
Upon thy lip I seal sincerity.

Exit First Courtesan.

SECOND COURTESAN 
Was this your vow to me?

TAILBY 
Pox, what's a kiss to be quite rid of her? 
She's su'd so long, I was asham'd of her: 
'Twas but her cheek I kiss'd neither, to save her Ionging.

SECOND COURTESAN 
'Tis not a kiss I weigh.

TAILBY 
Had you weigh'd this, 
'T 'ad lack'd above five ounces of a true one; 
No kiss that e'er weigh'd lighter.

SECOND COURTESAN 
'Tis thy love that I suspect.

TAILBY 
My love? Why, by this-- What shall I swear by?

SECOND COURTESAN 
Swear by this jewel; keep thy oath, keep that.

TAILBY 
By this jewel, then, no creature can be perfect 
In my love but thy dear self.

SECOND COURTESAN 
I rest [content].

Exit.

TAILBY 
Ha, ha, ha! Let's laugh at 'em, sweet soul.

NOVICE 
Ay, they may laugh at me; 
I was a novice, and believ'd your oaths.

TAILBY 
Why, what do you think of me? Make I no difference 
['Tween] seven years' prostitution and seven days? 
Why, you're but in the wane of a maid yet. 
You wrong my health in thinking I love them: 
Do not I know their populous imperfections? 
Why, they cannot live till Easter, 
Let 'em show the fairest side to th' world, 
Like hundreds more, whose clothes e'en stand upright 
In silver, when their bodie[s] are ready 
To drop through 'em; such there be; they may deceive 
The world, they ne'er shall me.

NOVICE 
Forgive my doubts; 
And for some satisfaction wear this ring, 
From which I vow'd ne'er but to thee to part.

TAILBY 
With which thou ever bind'st me to thy heart.

Exeunt.


[II.ii. A street]
Enter Fitsgrave.

FITSGRAVE 
My pocket pick'd? This was no brothel-house! 
A music school? Damnation has fine shapes: 
I paid enough for the song, I've lost a jewel 
To me more precious than their souls to them 
That gave consent to filch it. I'll hunt hard, 
Waste time and money, trace and wheel about, 
But I will find these secret mischiefs out.

Enter Servant.

[Aside] How now? What's he? 
O, a servant to my love: being thus disguis'd, 
I'll learn some news.--Now, sir? You belong to me.

SERVANT 
I do, sir; but I cannot stay to say so. Nay, good sir, detain me not; I am going in all haste to inquire or lay wait for a chain of pearl, nimmed out of her pocket the fifth of November, a dismal day.

FITSGRAVE 
Ha! A chain of pearl, sayst thou?

SERVANT 
A chain of pearl, sir, which one Master Fitsgrave, a gentleman and a suitor, fastened upon her as a pledge of his love.

FITSGRAVE 
Ha!

SERVANT 
Urge me no more, I have no more to say 
Your friend, Jeronimo Bedlam.

Exit.

FITSGRAVE 
Thou'rt a mad fellow indeed. 
Some comfort yet, that hers is missing too; 
I feel my soul at much more ease: both stol'n! 
When griefs have partners they are better borne.

Exit.


[II.iii. A room in Primero's house]
Enter Tailby.

TAILBY 
[Singing] O, the parting of us twain 
Hath caus'd me mickle pain! 
And I shall ne'er be married 
Until I see my muggle again.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
[Looking in] Hist!

PRIMERO 
Ha?

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
The nimble gentleman, in the celestial stockings--

PRIMERO 
Has the best smock-fortune to be beloved of women. [Singing] Valle loo lo, lille lo lillo, valle loo lee lo lillo!

TAILBY 
[Singing] Valle loo lo, lille [lo] lillo, valle loo lee lo lillo!

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Ah, sweet gentleman, he keeps it up stately!

PRIMERO 
Well held, i'faith, sir: mass, and now I remember too, I think you ne'er saw my little banqueting box above since I altered it.

TAILBY 
Why, have you altered that?

PRIMERO 
O, divinely, sir! The pictures are all new run over again.

TAILBY 
Fie!

PRIMERO 
For what had the painter done, think you? Drew me Venus naked, which is the grace of a man's room, you know; and, when he had done, drew a number of oaken leaves before her: had not lawn been a hundred times softer, made a better show, and been more gentlewoman-like?

TAILBY 
More lady-like a great deal.

PRIMERO 
Come, you shall see how 'tis altered now; I do not think but you'll like her.

Exeunt.


[II.iv. A room in the Mitre]
Enter all at once[: Primero, Courtesans, Novice, Goldstone, Pursenet, Frippery, Tailby, Bungler, Fulk, Arthur, Boy, and Servant.]

PRIMERO 
Where be your liveries?

FIRST COURTESAN 
They attend without.

PRIMERO 
Go, call the coach.

[Exit Servant.]

Gentlemen, you have excelled in kindness as we in boldness.

TAILBY 
So you think amiss, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
Kind ladies, we commit you to sweet dreams, 
Ourselves unto the fortune of the dice. 
Dice, ho!

Exit Primero.

FIRST COURTESAN 
You rest firm mine?

TAILBY 
E'en all my soul to thee.

Exit First Courtesan.

SECOND COURTESAN 
You keep your vows?

TAILBY 
Why, do I breathe or see?

Exit Second Courtesan.

NOVICE 
Is your love constant?

TAILBY 
Ay, to none but thee.

Exit Novice.

Now gone, ay, now I love nor them nor thee; 
'Slife, I should be cloy'd, should I love one in three.

Enter Fitsgrave.

PURSENET 
O, here's Master Bouser now.

FITSGRAVE 
Save you, sweet gentlemen.

TAILBY 
Sweet Master Bouser, welcome.

PURSENET 
When come these dice?

VINTNER 
[Within] Anon, anon, sir.

PURSENET 
Yet anon, anon, sir!

GOLDSTONE 
[Taking Fulk aside] Hast thou shown art in 'em?

FULK 
You shall be judge, sir; here be the tavernbeakers, and here peep out the fine alchemy knaves, looking like, well, sir, most of our gallants, that seem what they are not.

GOLDSTONE 
Peace, villain, am not I in presence?

FULK 
Why, that puts me in mind of the jest, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
Again, you [chatterer]?

FULK 
Nay, compare 'em, and spare 'em not.

GOLDSTONE 
The bigness of the bore, just the same size; the marks, no difference. Away, put money in thy pocket, and offer to draw in upon the least occasion.

FULK 
I am no babe, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
Hist!

FULK 
What's the matter now?

GOLDSTONE 
Give me a pair of false dice ere you go.

FULK 
Pax on't, you're so troublesome too, you cannot remember a thing before! If I stay a little longer, I shall be staid anon.

Enter Vintner.

VINTNER 
Here be dice for your worships.

PURSENET 
Oh, come, come!

GOLDSTONE 
[Aside] The vintner himself? 
I'll shift away these beakers by a slight.

VINTNER 
Master Goldstone--

GOLDSTONE 
How now, you conjuring rascal?

VINTNER 
Bless your good worship; you're in humours, methinks.

GOLDSTONE 
Humours? Say that again.

VINTNER 
I said no such word, sir. 
[Aside] Would I had my beakers out on's fingers!
GOLDSTONE 
What's thy name, vintner?
VINTNER 
Jack, and please your worship.
GOLDSTONE 
Turn knight, like thy companions, scoundrel, live upon usury, wear thy gilt spurs at thy girdle for fear of slubbering.

VINTNER 
Oh no, I hope I shall have more grace than so, sir! Pray, let me help your worship.

GOLDSTONE 
Cannot I push 'em together without your help?

VINTNER 
O, I beseech your worship! They're the two standards of my house.

GOLDSTONE 
Standards? There lie your standards.

VINTNER 
Good your worship. [Aside] I am glad they are out of his fingers: my wife shall lock 'em up presently; they shall see no sun this twelvemonth's day for this trick.

GOLDSTONE 
Let me come to the sight of your standards again.

VINTNER 
Your worship shall pardon me. [Aside] Now you shall not see 'em in haste, I warrant ye.

GOLDSTONE 
I do not desire't. Ha, ha!

Exit Vintner with beakers.

FITSGRAVE 
Why, Master Goldstone!

GOLDSTONE 
I am for you, gallants. Master Bouser, cry you mercy, sir: why supped you from us?

FITSGRAVE 
Faith, sir, I met with a couple of my fellow pupils at university, and so we renewed our acquaintance and supped together.

GOLDSTONE 
Fie, that's none of the newest fashion, I must tell you that, Master Bouser: you must never take acquaintance of any 'a th' university when you are at London; nor any of London when you're at university. You must be more forgetful, i'faith; every place ministers his acquaintance abundantly.

BUNGLER 
He tells you true, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
I warrant you here's a gentleman will ne'er commit such an absurdity.

BUNGLER 
Who, I? No: 'tis well known, if I be disposed, I'll forget any man in a seven-night, and yet look him in the face: nay, let him ride but ten mile from me, and come home again, it shall be at my choice whether I'll remember him or no: I have tried that.

GOLDSTONE 
This is strange, sir.

BUNGLER 
'Tis as a man gives his mind to't, sir: and now you bring me in, I remember 'twas once my fortune to be cozened of all my clothes, and with my clothes my money; a poor shepherd, pitying, me, took me in and relieved me.

GOLDSTONE 
'Twas kindly done of him, i'faith.

BUNGLER 
Nay, you shall see now: 'twas his fortune likewise, not long after, to come to me in much distress, i'faith, and with weeping eyes; and do you think l remembered him?

GOLDSTONE 
You could not choose.

BUNGLER 
By my troth, not I; I forgot him quite, and never remembered him to this hour.

GOLDSTONE 
And yet knew who he was?

BUNGLER 
As well as I know you, i'faith: 'tis a gift given to some above others.

[FITSGRAVE] 
[Aside] To fools and knaves; they never miss on't.

BUNGLER 
Does any make such a wonder at this? Why, alas! 'Tis nothing to forget others! What say you to those that forget themselves?

GOLDSTONE 
Nay, then, to dice. 
Come, set me, gallants, set.

FRIPPERY 
Ay, fall to't, gentlemen. 
[Aside] I shall hear some news from some of you anon: 
I've th' art to know which lose, and ne'er look on. 
I'll be ready with all the worst money I can find about me.-- 
Arthur!

ARTHUR 
Here, sir.

FRIPPERY 
Stand ready.

ARTHUR 
Fear not me, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
These are mine, sir.

FRIPPERY 
[Aside] Here's a washed angel; 
It shall away : here's Mistress Rose-noble 
Has lost her maidenhead, crack'd in the ring; 
She's good enough for gamesters, and to pass 
From man to man: for gold presents at dice 
Your harlot, in one hour won and lost thrice; 
Every man has a fling at her.

TAILBY 
Again? Pax of these dice!

BUNGLER 
'Tis ill to curse the dead, sir.

[TAILBY] 
Mew, where should I wish 
The pox but among bones?

FITSGRAVE 
He tells you right, sir.

TAILBY 
I ne'er have any luck at these odd hands; 
None here to make us six? Why, Master Frip!

FRIPPERY 
I am very well here, I thank you, sir: I had rather be telling my money myself than have others count it for me; 'tis the scurviest music in the world, methinks, to hear my money gingle in other men's pockets; I never had any mind to't, i'faith.

TAILBY 
'Slud, play six or play four, I'll play no more.

GOLDSTONE 
'Sfoot, you see there's none here to draw in.

FULK 
Rather than you should be destitute, gentlemen, I'll play my ten pound, if my master's worship will give me leave.

PURSENET 
Come.

TAILBY 
He shall, he shall.

GOLDSTONE 
Pray, excuse me, gentlemen. [To Fulk] 'Sfoot, how now, goodman rascal? What, because you served my grandfather when he went ambassador, and got some ten pound by th' hand, has that put such spirit in you to offer to draw in among gentlemen of worship, knave?

TAILBY 
Pray, sir, let's entreat so much for once.

PURSENET 
'Tis a usual grace, i'faith, sir; you've many gentlemen will play with their men.

BUNGLER 
Ay, and with their maids too, i'faith.

PURSENET 
Good sir, give him leave.

GOLDSTONE 
Yes, come, and you be weary on't; I pray draw near, sir.

FULK 
Not so, sir.

TAILBY 
Come, fool, fear nothing; I warrant 't ye has given thee leave: stand here by me. Come now, set round, gentlemen, set.

PURSENET 
How the poor fellow shakes! Throw lustily, man.

FULK 
At all, gentlemen!

TAILBY 
Well said, i'faith.

[Fulk throws the dice.]

PURSENET 
They're all [thine].

TAILBY 
By my troth, I am glad the fellow has such luck, 'twill encourage him well.

FULK 
At my master's worship alone!

GOLDSTONE 
Now, sir slave?

FULK 
At my master's worship alone!

GOLDSTONE 
So, saucy rascal!

FULK 
At my master's worship alone!

GOLDSTONE 
You're a rogue, and will be ever one.

FULK 
By my troth, gentlemen, at all again for once.

[Fulk throws the dice.]

TAILBY 
Take 'em to thee, boy, take 'em to thee; thou'rt worthy of 'em, i'faith.

GOLDSTONE 
Gentlemen, faith, I am angry with you: go and suborn my knave again me here, to make him proud and peremptory!

TAILBY 
Troth, that's but your conceit, sir; the fellow's an honest fellow, and knows his duty, I dare swear for him.

PURSENET 
Heart, I am sick already!

GOLDSTONE 
Whither goes Master [Pursenet]?

PURSENET 
Play on; I'll take my turn, sir. Boy!

BOY 
Master?

PURSENET 
Pist! [Taking him aside] A supply; carry't closely, my little fooker. How much?

BOY 
Three pound, sir.

PURSENET 
Good boy! Take out another lesson.--How now, gentlemen?

TAILBY 
Devil's in't, did you e'er see such a hand?

PURSENET 
I set you these three angels.

BOY 
[Aside] My master may set high, for all his stakes are drawn out of other men's pockets.

[Exit.]

FULK 
As I said, gentlemen.

PURSENET 
Deuce ace!

FULK 
At all your right worshipful worships!

ALL 
Death and vengeance!

GOLDSTONE 
Hell, darkness!

TAILBY 
Hold, sir.

PURSENET 
Master Goldstone--

GOLDSTONE 
Hinder me not, sweet gentlemen. [To Fulk] You rascal, I banish thee the board.

TAILBY 
I'faith, but you shall not, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
Touch a die, and thou darest! Come you in with your lousy ten pound, you slave, among gentlemen of worship, and win thirty at a hand?

TAILBY 
Why, will you kick again luck, sir?

BUNGLER 
As long as the poor fellow ventures the loss of his own money, who can be offended at his fortunes?

FULK 
I have a master here! Many a gentleman would be glad to see his man come forward, aha.

PURSENET 
Pray, be persuaded, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
'Slife, here's none cuts my throat in play but he; I have observ'd it, an unlucky slave 'tis.

BUNGLER 
Methinks his luck's good enough, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
Upon condition, gentlemen, that I may ever bar him from the board hereafter, I am content to wink at him.

PURSENET 
Faith, use your own pleasure hereafter; h'as won our money now. [To Fulk] Come to th' table, sir; your master's friends with you.

FULK 
Pray, gentlemen--

TAILBY 
The fiend's in't, I think: I left a fair chain of pearl at my lodging, too, like an ass, and ne'er remembered it; that would ha' been a good pawn now. [To Frippery] Speak, what do you lend upon these, Master Frip? [Offering his weapons, with girdle and hangers] I care not much if you take my beaver hat too, for I perceive 'tis dark enough already, and it does but trouble me here.

FRIPPERY 
Very well, sir; why, now I can lend you three pound, sir.

TAILBY 
Prithee, do't quickly then.

FRIPPERY 
There 'tis in six angels.

TAILBY 
Very compendiously.

FRIPPERY 
Here, Arthur, run away with these presently; I'll enter 'em into th' shopbook tomorrow.

[Exit Arthur with pawned items.]

[Writing] "Item, one gilt hatch'd rapier and dagger, with a fair embroidered girdle and hangers, with which came also a beaver hat with a correspondent band."

TAILBY 
Push! I'faith, sir, you're to blame; you have snibbed the poor fellow too much; he can scarce speak, he cleaves his words with sobbing.

FULK 
Haff, haff, haff, haff at all, gentlemen.

GOLDSTONE 
Ah, rogue, I'll make you know yourself!

FULK 
At the fairest!

PURSENET 
Out, i'faith! Two aces.

GOLDSTONE 
I am glad of that; come, pay me all these, goodman cloak-bag.

PURSENET 
Why, are you the fairest, sir?

GOLDSTONE 
You need not doubt of that, sir.--Five angels, you scoundrel!

[TAILBY] 
Fie a' these dice! Not one hand tonight! There they go, gentlemen, at all, i'faith!

PURSENET 
Pay all with two treys and a quater.

TAILBY 
All curses follow 'em! Pay yourselves withal. I'll pawn myself to't, but I'll see a hand tonight: not once hold in! Here, Master Frip, lend me you hand, quick, quick; so.

[Takes off his doublet.]

FRIPPERY 
What do you borrow of this doublet now?

TAILBY 
Ne'er saw the world three days.

FRIPPERY 
Go to; in regard you're a continual customer I'll use you well, and pleasure you with five angels upon't.

TAILBY 
Let me not stand too long i' th' cold for them.

BUNGLER 
Had ever country gentleman such fortune? All swoopt away! I'd need repair to th' broker's.

TAILBY 
If you be in that mind, sir, there sits a gentleman will furnish you upon any pawn as well as the publickst broker of 'em all.

BUNGLER 
Say you so, sir? There's comfort in that, i'faith.

FRIPPERY 
[Writing] "Item, upon his orange-tawny satin doublet, five angels."

BUNGLER 
But, by your leave, sir, next comes the breeches.

FRIPPERY 
O, I have tongue fit for anything.

BUNGLER 
Saving your tale, sir; 'tis given me to understand that you are a gentleman i' th' hundred, and deal in the premises aforesaid.

FRIPPERY 
Master Bungler, Master Bungler, you're mightily mistook: I am content to do a gentleman a pleasure for once, so his pawn be neat and sufficient.

BUNGLER 
Why, what say you to my grandfather's seal-ring here?

FRIPPERY 
Ay, marry, sir, this is somewhat like.

BUNGLER 
Nay, view it well; an ancient arms, I can tell you.

FRIPPERY 
What's this, sir?

BUNGLER 
The great cod-piece, with nothing in't.

FRIPPERY 
How!

BUNGLER 
The word about it, Parturiunt montes.

FRIPPERY 
What's that, I pray, sir?

BUNGLER 
"You promise to mount us."

FRIPPERY 
And belike he was not so good as his word?

BUNGLER 
So it should seem by the story, for so our names came to be Bunglers.

FRIPPERY 
A lamentable hearing, that so great a house should shrink and fall to ruin!

PURSENET 
Two quaters, and yet lose it? Heart! Boy!

[Enter Boy.]

[Aside to him] I'faith, what is't?

BOY 
[Aside to him] Five pound, sir.

PURSENET 
[Aside] By my troth, this boy goes forward well; ye shall see him come to his preferment i' th' end!

GOLDSTONE 
Why, how now? Who's that, gentlemen? A bargeman?

TAILBY 
I never have any luck, gallants, till my doublet's off; I'm not half nimble enough at this, old cinque-quater drivel-beard.

[FULK] 
Your worship must pay me all these, sir.

TAILBY 
There, and feast the devil with 'em!

PURSENET 
Hell gnaw these dice!

GOLDSTONE 
What, do you give over, gallants?

FULK 
[Aside to Goldstone] Is't not time?

TAILBY 
I protest I have but one angel left to guide me home to my lodging.

GOLDSTONE 
[Aside to Fulk] How much, thinkest?

FULK 
[Aside to Goldstone] Some fourscore angels, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
[Aside to Fulk] Peace, we'll join powers anon, and see how strong we are in the whole number. Mass, yon gilt goblet stands so full in mine eye, the whoreson tempts me; it comes like cheese after a great feast, to disgest the rest: he will hardly 'scape me, i'faith, I see that by him already: back for a parting blow now.--Boy!

Enter Vintner.

VINTNER 
Anon, anon, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
Fetch a pennyworth of soft wax to seal letters.

VINTNER 
I will, sir.

Exit.

TAILBY 
Nay, had not I strange casting? Thrice together two quaters and a deuce!

PURSENET 
Why, was not I as often haunted with two treys and a quater?

Enter Vintner.

VINTNER 
There's wax for your worship. [To offstage] Anon, anon, sir.

Exit.

GOLDSTONE 
[Aside to Fulk] Screen me a little, you whoreson old cross-biter.

FULK 
[Aside to Goldstone] Why, what's the business? Filch it on hob goblet?

PURSENET 
And what has Master Bouser lost?

FITSGRAVE 
Faith, not very deeply, sir; enough for a scholar, some half a score royals.

PURSENET 
'Sfoot, I have lost as many with spurs at their heels.

Enter Vintner with two Drawers.

GOLDSTONE 
Come, gallants, shall we stumble?

TAILBY 
What's a' clock?

FIRST DRAWER 
Here's none on't, Dick; the goblet's carried down.

GOLDSTONE 
Nay, 'tis upon the point of three, boy.

[SECOND DRAWER 
What's to be done, sirs?]

VINTNER 
All's paid, and your worships are welcome; only there's a goblet missing, gentlemen, and cannot be found about house.

GOLDSTONE 
How, a goblet?

PURSENET 
What manner a' one?

VINTNER 
A gilt goblet, sir, of an indifferent size.

GOLDSTONE 
'Sfoot, I saw such a one lately.

VINTNER 
It cannot be found now, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
Came there no strangers here?

VINTNER 
No, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
['Tis] a marvellous matter, that a goblet should be gone, and none but we in the room; the loss is [near] all, here as we are; keep the door, vintner.

VINTNER 
No, I beseech your worship.

GOLDSTONE 
By my troth, vintner, we'll have a privy search for this. What, we are not all one woman's children.

VINTNER 
I beseech ye, gentlemen, have not that conceit of me, that I suspect your worships.

GOLDSTONE 
Tut, you are an ass; do you know every man's nature? There's a broker i' th' company.

PURSENET 
[Aside to Boy] 'Slife, you have not stole the goblet, boy, have you?

BOY 
[Aside to Pursenet] Not I, sir.

PURSENET 
[Aside to Boy] I was afraid.--'Tis a good cause, i'faith, let each man search his fellow: we'll begin with you.

TAILBY 
I shall save somebody a labour, gentlemen, for I'm half searched already.

PURSENET 
I thought the goblet had hung here, i'faith; none here, nor here.

GOLDSTONE 
Seek about floor. What was the goblet worth, vintner?

VINTNER 
Three pound ten shillings, sir; no more.

GOLDSTONE 
Pox on't, gentlemen, 'tis but angels apiece: it shall be a brace of mine, rather than I would have our reputations breathed upon by all comers; for you must think they'll talk on't in all companies--such a night, in such a company, such a goblet: 'sfoot, it may grow to a gangrene in our credits, and be incurable.

TAILBY 
Faith, I am content.

FRIPPERY 
So am I.

PURSENET 
There's my angel too.

GOLDSTONE 
So, and mine. [To Vintner] I'll tell thee what, the missing of this goblet has dismayed the gentlemen much.

VINTNER 
I am sorry for that, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
Yet they send thee this comfort by me; if they see thee but rest satisfied, and depart away contented, which will appear in thy countenance, not three times thrice the worth of the goblet shall hang between them and thee, both in their continual custom and all their acquaintances.

VINTNER 
I thank their worships all; I am satisfied.

GOLDSTONE 
Say it again.--Do you hear, gentlemen?

VINTNER 
I thank your worships all; I am satisfied.

Exeunt Vintner and Drawers.

GOLDSTONE 
Why, la, was not this better than hazarding our reputations upon trifles, and in such public as a tavern, such a questionable place?

TAILBY 
True.

PURSENET 
Faith, it was well thought on.

[GOLDSTONE] 
Nay, keep your way, gentlemen: I have sworn, Master Bouser, I will be last, i'faith.

[Exeunt all except Goldstone and Fulk.]

Rascal, the goblet!

FULK 
Where, sir?

GOLDSTONE 
Peep yon, sir, under.

FULK 
Here, sir.

He draws out the goblet. Exeunt.


[III.i. A room in Tailby's lodging]
Enter Tailby reading a letter.

TAILBY 
[Reading] "My husband is rode from home: make no delay; I know, if your will be as free as your horse, you will see me yet ere dinner. From Kingston, this eleventh of November." Hah! These women are such creatures, such importunate, sweet souls, they'll scarce give a man leave to be ready; that's their only fault, i'faith: if they be once set upon a thing, why, there's no removing of 'em, till their pretty wills be fulfilled. O, pity thy poor oppressed client here, sweet Cupid, that has scarce six hours' vacation in a month, his causes hang in so many courts, yet never suffer my French adversary, nor his big swoll'n confederates, to overthrow me, 
Who without mercy would my blood carouse, 
And lay me in prison in a doctor's house. 
Thy clemency, great Cupid! Peace, who comes here?

Enter Pursenet.

PURSENET 
Sir gallant, well encountered.

TAILBY 
I both salute and take my leave together.

PURSENET 
Why, whither so fast, sir?

TAILBY 
Excuse me, pray; 
I'm in a little haste; my horse waits for me.

PURSENET 
What, some journey toward?

TAILBY 
A light one, i'faith, sir.

PURSENET 
I'm sorry that my business so commands me, 
I cannot ride with you; but I make no question 
You have company enough.

TAILBY 
Alas, not any! 
[Aside] Nor do I desire it.--Why, 'tis but a Kingston yonder.

PURSENET 
O, cry you mercy, sir.

TAILBY 
'Scape but one reach, 
There's a little danger thither.

PURSENET 
True, a little of Combe Park.

TAILBY 
You've nam'd the place, sir; that's all I fear, i'faith.

PURSENET 
Farewell, sweet Master Tailby.

Exit Tailby.

This fell out happily; 
I'll call this purchase mine before I greet him; 
E'en where his fear lies most, there will I meet him.

Exit.


[III.ii. Combe Park]
Enter Pursenet with a scarf over his face, and Boy.

PURSENET 
Boy.

BOY 
Sir?

PURSENET 
Walk my horse behind yon thicket; give a word if you descry.

BOY 
I have all perfect, sir.

Exit.

PURSENET 
So; he cannot now be long. What with my boy's dexterity at ordinaries, and my gelding's celerity over hedge and ditch, but we make pretty shift to rub out a gallant; for I have learnt these principles: 
Stoop thou to th' world, 'twill on thy bosom tread; 
It stoops to thee, if thou advance thy head. 
The mind being far more excellent than fate, 
'Tis fit our mind then be above our state. 
Why should I write my extremities in my brow, 
To make them loathe me that respect me now? 
If every man were in his courses known, 
Legs that now honour him might spurn him down. 
To conclude, nothing seems as it is but honesty, and that makes it so little regarded amongst us.

BOY 
[Within] Ela, ha, ho!

PURSENET 
The boy? He's hard at hand; 
I'll cross him suddenly: and here he comes.

Enter Tailby.

Stand!

TAILBY 
Ha!

PURSENET 
Deliver your purse, sir.

TAILBY 
I feared none but this place, i'faith; nay, when my mind gives me a thing once--

PURSENET 
Quick, quick, sir, quick; I must despatch three robberies yet ere night.

TAILBY 
I'm glad you have such good doings, by my troth, sir.

PURSENET 
You'll fare ne'er a whit the better for your flattery, I warrant you, sir.

TAILBY 
I speak sincerely; 'tis pity such a proper-parted gentleman should want; nor shall you, as long as I have't about me.

[Pursenet rifles his pockets.]

Nay, search and spare not: there's a purse in my left pocket, as I take it, with fifteen pound in gold in't, and there's a fair chain of pearl in the other: nay, I'll deal truly you; it grieves me, i'faith, when I see such goodly men in distress; I'll rather want it myself than they should go without it.

PURSENET 
And that shows a good nature, sir.

TAILBY 
Nay, though I say it, I have been always counted a man of a good nature; 
I might have hanged myself ere this time else. 
Pray, use me like a gentleman; take all, 
But injury not my body.

PURSENET 
You must pardon me, sir; 
I must a little play the usurer, 
And bind you, for mine own security.

TAILBY 
Alas! There's no conscience in that, sir! Shall 
I enter into bond and pay money too?

PURSENET 
Tut, I must not be betrayed.

TAILBY 
Hear me but what 
I say, sir; I do protest I would not be he 
That should betray a man, to be prince of the world.

PURSENET 
Mass, that's the devil--l thank you heartily-- 
For he's call'd prince a' th' world.

TAILBY 
You take me still at worst.

PURSENET 
Swear on this sword then, 
To set spurs to your horse, not to look back, 
To give no marks to any passenger.

TAILBY 
Marks? Why, I think you have left me ne'er a penny, sir.

PURSENET 
I mean, no marks of me.

TAILBY 
I understand you, sir.

PURSENET 
Swear then.

TAILBY 
I'faith, I do, sir.

PURSENET 
Away!

TAILBY 
I'm gone, sir. [Aside] By my troth, of a fierce thief he seems to be a very honest gentleman.

Exit.

PURSENET 
Why, this was well adventur'd, trim a gallant! 
Now, with a courteous and long-thirsting eye, 
Let me behold my purchase, 
And try the soundness of my bones with laughter. 
How? Is not this the chain of pearl I gave 
To that perjured harlot? 'Tis, 'sfoot, 'tis, 
The very chain! O damned mistress! Ha! 
And this the purse which, not five days before, 
I sent her filled with fair spur-royals? Heart, 
The very gold! 'Slife, is this no robbery? 
How many oaths flew toward heaven, 
Which ne'er came half-way thither, but, like firedrakes, 
Mounted a little, gave a crack, and fell: 
Feign'd oaths bound up to sink more deep to hell. 
What folded paper's this? Death, 'tis her hand! 
[Reading] "Master Tailby, you know with what affection I love you." You do? "I count the world but as my prey to maintain you." The more dissembling quean you, I must tell you. "I have sent you an embroidered purse here with fifty fair spur-royals in't." A pox on you for your labour, wench! "And I desire you of all loves to keep that chain of pearl from Master Pursenet's sight." He cannot, strumpet; I behold it now, unto thy secret torture. "So fare thee well, but be constant and want nothing"--as long as I ha't, i'faith, methinks it should have gone so. Well, what a horrible age do we live in, that a man cannot have a quean to himself! Let him but turn his back, the best of her is chipp'd away like a court loaf, that when a man comes himself, has nothing but bumbast; and these are two simple chippings here. Does my boy pick and I steal to enrich myself, to keep her, to maintain him? Why, this is right the sequence of the world. A lord maintains her, she maintains a knight, he maintains a whore, she maintains a captain. So in like manner the pocket keeps my boy, he keeps me, I keep her, she keeps him; it runs like quicksilver from one to another. 'Sfoot, I perceive I have been the chief upholder of this gallant all this while: it appears true, we that pay dearest for our pasture are ever likely worse used. 'Sfoot, he has a nag can run for nothing, has his choice, nay, and gets by the running of [her]. O fine world, strange devils, and pretty damnable affections!

BOY 
[Within] Lela, ha, ho!

PURSENET 
There, boy, again: what news there?

Enter Boy.

BOY 
Master, pist, master!

PURSENET 
How now, boy?

BOY 
I have descried a prize.

PURSENET 
Another, lad?

BOY 
The gull, the scholar.

PURSENET 
Master Bouser?

BOY 
Ay; 
Comes along this way.

PURSENET 
Without company?

BOY 
As sure as he is your own.

PURSENET 
Back to thy place, boy.

Exit Boy.

I have the luck today to rob in safety; 
Two precious cowards! Whist; I hear him.

Enter Fitsgrave.

Stand!

FITSGRAVE 
You lie; I came forth to go.

PURSENET 
Deliver your purse.

FITSGRAVE 
'Tis better in my pocket.

PURSENET 
How now? At disputations, signior fool?

FITSGRAVE 
I've so much logic to confute a knave, 
A thief, a rogue!

[Attacks and strikes Pursenet down.]

PURSENET 
Hold, hold, sir, and you be 
A gentleman, hold! Let me rise.

FITSGRAVE 
[Aside] Heart! 
'Tis the courtesy of his scarf unmask'd him to me 
Above the lip by chance: I'll counterfeit.-- 
Light, 
Because I am a scholar, you think belike 
That scholars have no metal in 'em, but you 
Shall find I have not done with you, cousin.

[Beats Pursenet.]

PURSENET 
As you're a gentleman!

FITSGRAVE 
As you're a rogue!

PURSENET 
Keep on upon your way, sir.

FITSGRAVE 
You bade me stand--

PURSENET 
I have been once down for that.

FITSGRAVE 
And then deliver.

PURSENET 
Deliver me from you, sir! 
O, pax on't, has wounded me! 
Ela, ha, ho: my horse, my horse, boy!

Exit.

FITSGRAVE 
Have you your boy so ready? O thou world, 
How art thou muffled in deceitful forms! 
There's such a mist of these, and still hath been, 
The brightness of true gentry is scarce seen. 
This journey was most happily assign'd; 
I've found him dross both in his means and mind. 
What paper's this he dropp'd? I'll look on't as I go.

Exit.


[III.iii. Near Combe Park]
Enter Pursenet and Boy.

PURSENET 
A gull call you him? Let me always set upon wise men; they'll be afraid of their lives; they have a feeling of their iniquities, and [know] what 'tis to die with fighting: 'sfoot, this gull lays on without fear or wit. How deep's it, sayst thou, boy?

BOY 
By my faith, three inches, sir.

PURSENET 
La, this was long of you, you rogue!

BOY 
Of me, sir?

PURSENET 
Forgive me, dear boy; my wound ached, and I grew angry: there's hope of life, boy, is there not?

BOY 
Pooh, my life for yours!

[Exit Boy.]

PURSENET 
A comfortable boy in man's extremes! I was ne'er so afraid in my life but the fool would have seen my face: he had me at such advantage, he might have commanded my scarf. I 'scaped well there; 't 'ad choked me; my reputation had been past recovery: yet live I unsuspected, and still fit for gallant's choice societies. But here I vow, if e'er I see this Bouser when he cannot see me, either in by-lane, privilege[d] place, court, alley or come behind him when he's standing, 
Or take him when he reels from a tavern late, 
Pissing again a conduit, wall, or gate; 
When he's in such a plight, and clear from me[n], 
I'll do that I'm ashamed to speak till then.

Exit.


[III.iv. A street]
Enter two Gentlemen[, Fitsgrave and the First Gentleman].

FITSGRAVE 
Nay, read forward. I have found three of your gallants, like your bewitching shame, merely sophistical: there's your bawd-gallant, your pocket-gallant, and your whore-gallant.

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
[Reading] "Master Tailby--"

FITSGRAVE 
That's he.

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
[Reading] "I count the world but as my prey to maintain you."

FITSGRAVE 
That's just the phrase and style of 'em all to him; they meet altogether in one effect, and it may well hold, too, for they all jump upon one cause, subaudi lechery.

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
What shapes can flattery take! Let me entreat you, 
Both in the virgin's right and our good hopes, 
Since your hours are so fortunate, to proceed.

FITSGRAVE 
Why, he's base that fares until he crown his deed.

Exit [with First Gentleman].


[III.v. A room in Primero's house]
Enter Pursenet (his arm in a scarf) and Boy, meeting First Courtesan.

PURSENET 
[Aside] See that dissembling devil, that perjur'd strumpet!

FIRST COURTESAN 
Welcome, my soul's best wish. O, out, alas! 
Thy arm bound in a scarf? I shall swoon instantly.

PURSENET 
Heart, and I'll fetch you again in the same tune. 
O my unmatch'd love, if any spark of life remain, 
Look up, my comfort, my delight, my--

FIRST COURTESAN 
O good, O good!

PURSENET 
The organ of her voice is tun'd again; 
There's hope in women when their speech returns; 
See, like the moon after a black eclipse, 
She by degrees recovers her pure light. 
How cheers my love?

FIRST COURTESAN 
As one new-wak'd out of a deadly trance, 
The fit scarce quiet.

PURSENET 
'Twas terrible for the time; 
I'd much ado to fetch you.

FIRST COURTESAN 
[Aside] 'Shrew your fingers!-- 
How came my comfort wounded? Speak.

PURSENET 
Faith, in a fray last night.

FIRST COURTESAN 
In a fray? Will you lose your blood so vainly? 
Many a poor creature lacks it. Tell me, how? 
What was the quarrel?

PURSENET 
Loath to tell you that.

FIRST COURTESAN 
Loath to tell me?

PURSENET 
Yet 'twas my cause of coming.

FIRST COURTESAN 
Why, then, must not I know it?

PURSENET 
Since you urge it, 
You shall: you're a strumpet!

FIRST COURTESAN 
O, news abroad, sir!

PURSENET 
Say you so?

FIRST COURTESAN 
Why, you knew that the first night you lay with me.

PURSENET 
Nay, not to me only, but to the world.

FIRST COURTESAN 
Speak within compass, man.

PURSENET 
Faith, you know none, 
You sail without.

FIRST COURTESAN 
I have the better skill then.

PURSENET 
At my first step into a tavern-room, to spy 
That chain of pearl wound on a stranger's arm 
You begg'd of me!

FIRST COURTESAN 
How? You mistook it sure.

PURSENET 
By heaven, the very self-same chain!

FIRST COURTESAN 
O, cry you mercy, 'tis true, I'd forgot it: 'tis Saint George's day tomorrow: I lent it to my cousin only to grace his arm before his mistress.

PURSENET 
Notable cunning!

FIRST COURTESAN 
And is this all now, i'faith?

PURSENET 
Not; I durst go further.

FIRST COURTESAN 
Why, let me never possess your love if you see not that again a' Thursday morning: I take't unkindly, i'faith, you should fall out with me for such a trifle.

PURSENET 
Better and better!

FIRST COURTESAN 
Come, a kiss, and friends!

PURSENET 
Away!

FIRST COURTESAN 
By this hand, I'll spoil your arm and you will not.

PURSENET 
More for this than the devil--

Enter Goldstone, Tailby, Fitsgrave, Bungler, and Courtesans.

GOLDSTONE 
Yea, at your book so hard?

PURSENET 
Against my will. [Aside] Are you there, Signior Logic? A pox of you, sir!

GOLDSTONE 
Why, how now? What has fate sent us here, in the name of Venus, goddess of Cyprus?

PURSENET 
A freebooter's pink, sir, three or four inches deep.

GOLDSTONE 
No more? That's conscionable, i'faith.

TAILBY 
Troth, I'm sorry for't: pray, how came it, sir?

PURSENET 
Faith, by a paltry fray, in Coleman Street.

FITSGRAVE 
[Aside] Combe Park, he would say.

PURSENET 
No less than three at once, sir, 
Made a triangle with their swords and daggers, 
And all opposing me.

FITSGRAVE 
And amongst those three only one hurt you, sir?

PURSENET 
Ex for ex.

TAILBY 
Troth, and I'll tell you what luck I had too, since I parted from you last.

PURSENET 
What, I pray?

TAILBY 
The day you offered to ride with me, I wish now I'd had your company: 'sfoot, I was set upon in Combe Park by three too.

PURSENET 
Bah!

TAILBY 
Robbed, by this light, of as much gold and jewels as I value at forty pound.

PURSENET 
Sure Saturn is in the fifth house.

TAILBY 
I know not that; he may be in the sixth and he will for me: I am sure they were in my pocket wheresoever they [are]; but I'll ne'er refuse a gentleman's company again when 'tis offered me, I warrant you.

GOLDSTONE 
I must remember you 'tis Mitre-night, ladies.

SECOND COURTESAN 
Mass, 'tis indeed Friday today, I'd quite forgot: when a woman's busy, how the time runs away!

FIRST COURTESAN 
[Taking Tailby aside] O, you've betrayed us both!

TAILBY 
I understand you not.

FIRST COURTESAN 
You've let him see the chain of pearl I gave you.

TAILBY 
Who? Him? Will you believe me, by this hand, 
He never saw it.

FIRST COURTESAN 
Upon a stranger's arm he swore to me.

TAILBY 
Mass, that may be; for the truth is, i'faith, 
I was robb'd on't at Combe Park.

FIRST COURTESAN 
'Twas that betrayed it.

TAILBY 
I would [I] had stay'd him; 
He was no stranger, he was a thief, i'faith, 
For thieves will be no strangers.

FIRST COURTESAN 
How shall I excuse it?

[Bungler seizes the Boy, who had attempted to pick his pocket.]

BUNGLER 
Nay, I have you fast enough, boy; you rogue!

BOY 
Good sir, I beseech you, sir, let me go!

BUNGLER 
A pickpocket! Nay, you shall to Newgate, look you. [To Pursenet] Is this your boy, sir?

PURSENET 
How now, boy? A monster? Thy arm lined fast in another's pocket? Where learnt you that manners? What company have you kept a' late, that you are so transformed into a rogue? That shape I know not. Believe me, sir, I much wonder at the alteration of this boy, where he should get this nature: as good a child to see to, and as virtuous; he has his creed by heart, reads me his chapter duly every night; he will not miss you one tittle in the nine commandments.

BUNGLER 
There's ten of 'em.

PURSENET 
I fear he skips o'er one, "Thou shalt not steal."

BUNGLER 
Mass, like enough.

PURSENET 
Else grace and memory would quite abash the boy. 
[To Boy] Thou graceless imp! Ah, thou prodigious child, 
Begot at some eclipse, degenerate rogue, 
Shame to thy friends, and to thy master eke! 
How far digressing from the noble mind 
Of thy brave ancestors, that lie in marble 
With their coat-armours o'er 'em!

BUNGLER 
Had he such friends?

PURSENET 
The boy is well descended, though he be a rogue, and has no feeling on't; yet for my sake, and for my reputation's, seek not the blood of the boy; he's near allied to many men of worship now yet living; a fine old man to his father; it would kill his heart, i'faith; he'd away like a chrisom.

BUNGLER 
Alas, good gentleman!

PURSENET 
Ah, shameless villain, 
Complain'st thou? Dost thou want?

BOY 
No, no, no, no!

PURSENET 
Art not well clad? Thy hunger well resisted?

BOY 
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

PURSENET 
But thou shall straight to Bridewell.

BOY 
Sweet master!

PURSENET 
Live upon bread and water and chap-choke.

BOY 
I beseech your worship!

BUNGLER 
[Taking Pursenet aside] Come, I'll be his surety for once.

PURSENET 
You shall excuse me indeed, sir.

BUNGLER 
He will mend: 'a may prove an honest man for all this. I know gallant gentlemen now that have done as much as this comes to in their youth.

PURSENET 
Say you so, sir?

BUNGLER 
And as for Bridewell, that will but make him worse; 'a will learn more knavery there in one week than will furnish him and his heirs for a hundred year.

PURSENET 
Deliver the boy!

BUNGLER 
Nay, I tell you true, sir; there's none goes in there a quean, but she comes out an arrant whore, I warrant you.

PURSENET 
The boy comes not there for a million!

BUNGLER 
No, you had better forgive him by ten parts.

PURSENET 
True; but 'a must not know it comes from me. 
[To Boy] Down a' your knees, you rogue, 
And thank this gentleman has got your pardon.

BOY 
O, I thank your worship!

PURSENET 
[Aside to Boy] A pox on you for a rogue; 
You put me to my set speech once a quarter.

GOLDSTONE 
Nay, gentlemen, you quite forget your hour; lead, Master Bouser.

[Exeunt all but Goldstone and Second Courtesan.]

SECOND COURTESAN 
Let me go: you're a dissembler.

GOLDSTONE 
How?

SECOND COURTESAN 
Did not you promise me a new gown?

GOLDSTONE 
Did I not? Yes, faith, did I, and thou shalt have it. [To one offstage] Go, sirrah, run for a tailor presently.

Enter Tailor.

Let me see for the colour now: orange-tawny, peach colour. What sayst to a watchet satin?

SECOND COURTESAN 
O, 'tis the only colour I affect!

TAILOR 
A very orient colour, an't please your worships. l made a gown on't for a gentlewoman t'other day, and it does passing well upon her.

GOLDSTONE 
A watchet satin gown--

TAILOR 
There your worship left, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
Laid about, tailor.

TAILOR 
Very good, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
With four fair laces.

TAILOR 
That will be costly, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
How, you rogue, costly? Out a' th' house, you slipshod, sham-legged, brown-thread-penny-skeined rascal!

SECOND COURTESAN 
Nay, my sweet love--

Exit Tailor.

GOLDSTONE 
Hang him, rogue! He's but a botcher neither: come, I'll send thee a fellow worth a hundred of this, if the slave were clean enough.

Exeunt.


IV.[i. Before Tailby's lodging]
Enter a Servant bringing in a suit of satin, who knocks at Tailby's door, from which enter Jack.

JACK 
Who knocks?

SERVANT 
A Christian: pray, is not this Master Tailby's lodging? I was directed hither.

JACK 
Yes, this is my master's lodging.

SERVANT 
Cry you mercy, sir: is he yet stirring?

JACK 
He's awake, but not yet stirring, for he played away half his clothes last night.

SERVANT 
My mistress commends her secrets unto him, and presents him by me with a new satin suit here.

JACK 
Mass, that comes happily.

SERVANT 
And she hopes the fashion will content him.

JACK 
There's no doubt to be had of that, sir: your mistress's name, pray?

[Servant shows Jack his mistress's name.]

You're much preciously welcome.

SERVANT 
I thank you uncommonly, sir.

JACK 
The suit shall be accepted, I warrant you, sir.

SERVANT 
That's all my mistress desires, sir.

JACK 
Fare you well, sir.

SERVANT 
Fare you well, sir.

Exit.

JACK 
This will make my master leap out of the bed for joy, and dance Wigmore's galliard in his shirt about the chamber!

Exit into the house.


[IV.ii. A hall in Tailby's lodging]
The music plays on awhile, then enter Tailby, his man [Jack] after, trussing him.

TAILBY 
Came this suit from Mistress Cleveland?

JACK 
She sent it secretly, sir.

TAILBY 
A pretty requiteful squall! I like that woman that can remember a good turn three months after the date; it shows both a good memory and a very feeling spirit.

JACK 
This came fortunately, sir, after all your ill luck last night.

TAILBY 
I'd beastly casting, Jack.

JACK 
O abominable, sir! You had the scurviest hand; the old serving-man swooped up all.

TAILBY 
I am glad the fortune lighted upon the poor fellow, by my troth; it made his master mad.

JACK 
Did you mark that, sir? I warrant he has the doggedest master of any poor fellow under the dog-sign: I'd rather serve your worship, I'll say that behind your back, sir, for nothing, as indeed I have no standing wages at all, your worship knows.

TAILBY 
O, but your vails, Jack, your vails considered, when you run to and fro between me and mistresses--

JACK 
I must confess my vails are able to keep an honest man, go I where I list.

TAILBY 
Go to then, Jack.
JACK 
But those vails stand with the state of your body, sir, as long as you hold up your head: if that droop once, farewell you, farewell I, farewell all; and droop it will, though all the caudles in Europe should put to their helping hands to't: 'tis e'en as uncertain as playing, now up and now [down]; for if the bill down rise to above thirty, here's no place for players; so if your years rise to above forty, there's no room for old lechers.

TAILBY 
And [that's] the reason all rooms are taken up for young templars.

JACK 
You're in the right, sir.

TAILBY 
Pize on't, I pawned a good beaver hat to Master Frip last night, Jack: I feel the want of it now.

Knocking within.

Hark, who's that knocks?

Enter a Servant, bringing in a letter and a beaver hat.

SERVANT 
Is Master Tailby stirring?

JACK 
What's your pleasure with him? He walks here i' th' hall.

SERVANT 
Give your worship good morrow.
TAILBY 
Welcome, honest lad.
SERVANT 
A letter from my mistress.
TAILBY 
Who's thy mistress?
SERVANT 
Mistress Newblock.
TAILBY 
Mistress Newblock, my sincere love; how does she?

SERVANT 
Faith, only ill in the want of your sight.
TAILBY 
Alas, dear sweet! I've had such business, I protest I ne'er stood still since I saw her.
SERVANT 
She has sent your worship a beaver hat here, with a band best in fashion.

TAILBY 
How shall I requite this dear soul?

SERVANT 
'Tis not a thing fit for me to tell you, sir, for I have three years to serve yet: your worship knows how, I warrant you.

TAILBY 
I know the drift of her letter; and for the beaver, say I accept it highly.

SERVANT 
O, she will be a proud woman of that, sir!

TAILBY 
And hark thee; tell thy mistress, as I'm a gentleman, I'll despatch her out of hand the first thing I do, a' my credit: canst thou remember these words now?

SERVANT 
Yes, sir; as you are a gentleman, you'll despatch her out of hand the first thing you do.

TAILBY 
Ay, a' my credit.

SERVANT 
O, of your credit; I thought not of that, sir.

TAILBY 
Remember that, good boy.

SERVANT 
Fear it not now, sir.

Exit.

TAILBY 
I dreamt tonight, Jack, I should have a secret supply out a' th' city.

JACK 
Your dream crawls out partly well, sir.

Enter a Servant, bringing in a purse.

What news there now?

SERVANT 
I have an errand to Master Tailby.

JACK 
Yonder walks my master.

SERVANT 
Mistress Tiffany commends her to your worship, and has sent you your ten pound in gold back again, and says she cannot furnish you of the same lawn you desire till after Allhollandtide.

TAILBY 
Thank her she would let me understand so much.

[Exit Servant.]

Ha, ha! 
This wench will live: why, this was sent like a 
Workwoman now; the rest are botchers to her. 
Faith, I commend her cunning: she's a fool 
That makes her servant fellow to her heart; 
It robs her of respect, dams up all duty, 
Keeps her in awe e'en of the slave she keeps: 
This takes a wise course--I commend her more-- 
Sends back the gold I never saw before. 
Well, women are my best friends [still], i'faith. 
[Take] lands: give me 
Good legs, firm back, white hand, black eye, brown hair, 
And add but to these five a comely stature; 
Let others live by art, and I by nature.

Exeunt.


[IV.iii. A room with a door opening into Fitsgrave's chamber]
Enter Goldstone.

GOLDSTONE 
Master Bouser, Master Bouser! Ha, ha, ho! Master Bouser!

FITSGRAVE 
[Within] Holla!

GOLDSTONE 
What, not out of thy kennel, Master Bouser?

FITSGRAVE 
[Within] Master Goldstone? You're an early gallant, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
[Aside] A fair cloak yonder, i'faith.--By my troth, a-bed, Master Bouser? You remember your promise well o'ernight!

FITSGRAVE 
[Within] Why, what's a' clock, sir?

GOLDSTONE 
Do you ask that now? Why, the chimes are spent at Saint Bride's.

FITSGRAVE 
[Within] 'Tis a gentleman's hour: faith, Master Goldstone, I'll be ready in a trice.

GOLDSTONE 
Away, there's no trust to you.

FITSGRAVE 
[Within] Faith, I'll come instantly.

GOLDSTONE 
[Aside] Nay, choose whether you will or no, by my troth, your cloak shall go before you.

[Takes Fitsgrave's cloak.]

FITSGRAVE 
[Within] Nay, Master Goldstone, I ha' sworn: do you hear, sir?

GOLDSTONE 
Away, away! Faith, I'm angry with you: pox, a-bed now! I'm ashamed of it.

Exit. [As Goldstone goes out, Fitsgrave enters in his shirt.]

FITSGRAVE 
Foot, my cloak, my cloak, Master Goldstone! 'Slife, what mean you by this, sir? You'll bring it back again, I hope. No? Not yet? By my troth, I care very little for such kind of jesting: methinks this familiarity now extends a little too far, unless it be a new fashion come forth this morning secretly; yesterday 'twould have shown unmannerly and saucily. I scarce know yet what to think on't. Well, there's no great profit in standing in my shirt, I'll on with my clothes: h'as bound me to follow the suit: my cloak's a stranger; he was made but yesterday, and I do not love to trust him alone in company.

Exit.


[IV.iv. A street]
Enter Frippery, wearing Fitsgrave's cloak.

FRIPPERY 
What may I conjecture of this Goldstone? He has not only pawned to me this cloak, but the very diamond and sapphire which I bestowed upon my new love at Master Primero's house: the cloak's new, and comes fitly to do me great grace at a wedding this morning, to which I was solemnly invited. I can continue change more than the proudest gallant of 'em all, yet never bestow penny of myself, my pawns do so kindly furnish me: but the sight of these jewels is able to cloy me, did I not preserve my stomach the better for the wedding-dinner. A gift could never have come in a more patient hour, nor to be better disgested. Is she proved false? But I'll not fret today nor chafe my blood.

Enter Pursenet.

PURSENET 
Ha! Yonder goes Bouser: the place is fit. [Calling out to Boy within] Boy, stand with my horse at corner. [Attacking Frippery] I owe you for a pink three inches deep, sir.

FRIPPERY 
O-O-O!

PURSENET 
Take that in part of payment for Combe Park.

Exit.

FRIPPERY 
O-O-O!

Enter Fitsgrave.

FITSGRAVE 
How now, who's this? 'Sfoot, one of our gallants knocked down like a calf! Is there such a plague of 'em here at London, they begin to knock 'em a' th' head already?

FRIPPERY 
O Master Bouser! Pray, lend me your hand, sir; I am slain!

FITSGRAVE 
Slain and alive? O cruel execution! 
What man so savage-spirited durst presume 
To strike down satin on two taffetas cut, 
Or lift his hand against a beaver hat?

FRIPPERY 
Some rogue that owes me money, and had no other means. To a wedding-dinner! I must be dressed myself, methinks.

FITSGRAVE 
How? Why, this [is] my cloak: life, how came my cloak hither?

FRIPPERY 
Is it yours, sir? Master Goldstone pawned it to me this morning fresh and fasting, and borrowed five pound upon't.

FITSGRAVE 
How, pawned it? Pray, let me hear out this story: come, and I'll [lead] you to the next barber-surgeon's. Pawned my cloak?

Exit leading out Frippery.


[IV.v. Another street]
Enter Bungler, Goldstone, and Marmaduke.

BUNGLER 
How now, Marmaduke? What's the wager?

MARMADUKE 
Nay, my care is at end, sir, now I am come to the sight of you. My mistress, your cousin, entreats you to take part of a dinner with her at home at her house, and bring what gentleman you please to accompany you.

BUNGLER 
Thank my sweet coz: I'll munch with her, say.

MARMADUKE 
I'll tell her so.

BUNGLER 
Marmaduke--

MARMADUKE 
Sir?

BUNGLER 
Will there be any stockfish, thinkest thou?

MARMADUKE 
How, sir?

BUNGLER 
Tell my coz I've a great appetite to stockfish, i'faith.

[Exit Marmaduke.]

Master Goldstone, I'll entreat you to be the gentleman that shall accompany me.

GOLDSTONE 
Not me, sir?

BUNGLER 
You, sir.

[GOLDSTONE] 
By my troth, concluded. What state bears thy coz, sirrah?

BUNGLER 
O, a fine merchant's wife.

GOLDSTONE 
Or rather, a merchant's fine wife.

BUNGLER 
Trust me, and that's the properer phrase here at London; and 'tis as absurd too to call him fine merchant, for, being at sea, a man knows not what pickle he is in.

GOLDSTONE 
Why, true.

BUNGLER 
Yet my coz will be served in plate, I can tell you; she has her silver jugs and her gilt tankards.

GOLDSTONE 
Fie!

BUNGLER 
Nay, you shall see a house dressed up, i'faith; you must not think to tread a' th' ground when you come there.

GOLDSTONE 
No? How then?

BUNGLER 
Why, upon paths made of fig-frails and white blankets cut out in steaks.

GOLDSTONE 
Away! [Aside] I have thought of a device.--Where shall we meet an hour hence?

BUNGLER 
In Paul's.

GOLDSTONE 
Agreed.

Exit Bungler. Enter Fitsgrave.

FITSGRAVE 
The broker-gallant and the cheating-gallant: 
Now I have found 'em all, I so rejoice, 
That the redeeming of my cloak I weigh not. 
I have spied him.

GOLDSTONE 
Pax, here's Bouser.

FITSGRAVE 
Master Goldstone, my cloak! Come, where's my cloak, sir?

GOLDSTONE 
O, you're a sure gentleman, especially if a man stand in need of you! He may be slain in a morning to breakfast ere you vouchsafe to peep out of your lodging.

FITSGRAVE 
How?

GOLDSTONE 
No less than four gallants, as I'm a gentleman, drew all upon me at once, and opposed me so spitefully, that I not only lost your cloak i' th' fray--

FITSGRAVE 
Comes it in there?

GOLDSTONE 
But my rich hangers, sirrah; l think thou hast seen 'em.

FITSGRAVE 
Never, i'faith, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
Those with the two unicorns, all wrought in pearl and gold: pox on't, it frets me ten times more than the loss of the paltry cloak: prithee, and thou lovest me, speak no more on't; it brings the unicorns into my mind, and thou wouldst not think how the conceit grieves me. I will not do thee that disgrace, i'faith, to offer thee any satisfaction, for in my soul I think thou scornest it; thou bearest that mind, in my conscience; I have always said so of thee. Fare thee well: when shall I see thee at my chamber, when?

FITSGRAVE 
Every day, shortly.

GOLDSTONE 
I have fine toys to show thee.

FITSGRAVE 
You win my heart then.

Exit Goldstone.

The devil scarce knew what a portion he gave his children when he allowed 'em large impudence to live upon, and so turned 'em into th' world: surely he gave away the third part of the riches of his kingdom; revenues are but fools to't. 
The filed tongue and the undaunted forehead 
Are mighty patrimonies, wealthier than those 
The city-sire or the court-father leaves: 
In these behold it: riches oft, like slaves, 
Revolt; they bear their foreheads to their graves. 
What soonest grasps advancement, men[d]s great suits, 
Trips down rich widows, gains repute and name, 
Makes way where'er it comes, bewitches all? 
Thou, Impudence, the minion of our days, 
On whose pale cheeks favour and fortune plays. 
Call you these your five gallants? 
Trust me, they're rare fellows: 
They live on nothing; many cannot live on something: 
Here they may take example. Suspectless virgin, 
How easy had thy goodness been beguil'd! 
Now only rests, that as to me they're known 
So to the world their base arts may be shown.

Exit.


[IV.vi. The middle aisle of St. Paul's]
Enter Pursenet and Boy.

PURSENET 
Art sure thou sawest him receive't, boy?

BOY 
Forty pound in gold, as I'm a gentleman born.

PURSENET 
Thy father gave the ram's head, boy?

BOY 
No, you're deceiv'd; my mother gave that, sir.

PURSENET 
What's thy mother's is thy father's.

Enter Pyamont.

BOY 
I'm sorry it holds in the ram's head. See, here he walks; I was sure he came into Paul's: the gold had been yours, master, long ere this, but that he wears both his hands in his pockets.

PURSENET 
How unfortunately is my purpose seated! What the devil should come in his mind to keep in his hands so long? The biting but of a paltry louse would do me great kindness now; [I'd know] not how to requite it: will no rascal creature assist me? Stay, what if I did impudently salute 'em out? Good. Boy, be ready, boy.

BOY 
Upon the least advantage, sir.

PURSENET 
[To Pyamont] You're most devoutly met in Paul's, sir.

PYAMONT 
So are you, but I scarce remember you, sir.

PURSENET 
O, I cry you mercy, sir; I pray, pardon me; I fear I have tendered an offence, sir: troth, I took you at the first for one Master Dumpling, a Norfolk gentleman.

[While Pursenet speaks, the Boy watches in vain for an opportunity to pick Pyamont's pocket.]

PYAMONT 
There's no harm done yet, sir.

PURSENET 
[Aside] I hope he is there by this time.--How now, boy, hast it?

BOY 
No, by troth, have I not; this labour's lost: 'tis in the right pocket, and he kept that hand in sure enough.

PURSENET 
[Aside] Unpractised gallant! Salute me but with one hand, 
Like a counterfeit soldier? O times and manners! 
Are we grown beasts? Do we salute by halves? 
Are not our limbs at leisure? Where's comely nurture? 
The Italian kiss, or the French cringe, 
With the Polonian waist? Are all forgot? 
Then misery follows. Surely fate forbade it: 
Had he employ'd but his right hand, I'd had it.

Enter Bungler.

It must be an everlasting device, I think, that procures both his hands out at once.

[Exit with Boy.]

PYAMONT 
Do you walk, sir?

BUNGLER 
No, I stay a little for a gentleman's coming, too.

PYAMONT 
Farewell then, sir: I have forty pound in gold about me, which I must presently send down into the country.

BUNGLER 
Fare you well, sir.

Exit Pyamont.

I wonder Master Goldstone spares my company so long; 'tis now about the navel of the day, upon the belly of noon.

Enter Goldstone and Fulk, both disguised.

GOLDSTONE 
[Aside to Fulk] See where he walks: be sure you let off at a twinkling, now.

FULK 
[Aside to Goldstone] When did I miss you?--Your worship has forgot you promised Mistress Newcut, your cousin, to dine with her this day.

GOLDSTONE 
Mass, that was well remembered.

BUNGLER 
I am bold to salute you, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
Sir?

BUNGLER 
Is Mistress Newcut your cousin, sir?

GOLDSTONE 
Yes, she's a cousin of mine, sir.

BUNGLER 
Then I am a cousin of yours, by the sister's side.

GOLDSTONE 
Let me salute you then; I shall be glad of your farther acquaintance.

BUNGLER 
I am a bidden guest there too.

GOLDSTONE 
Indeed, sir!

BUNGLER 
Faith, invited this morning.

GOLDSTONE 
Your good company shall be kindly embraced, sir.

BUNGLER 
I walk a turn or two here for a gentleman, but I think he'll either overtake me, or be before me.

GOLDSTONE 
'Tis very likely, sir. [To Fulk] There, sirrah, go to dinner and about two wait for me.

BUNGLER 
Nay, let him come between two and three, cousin, for we love to sit long at dinner i' th' city.

GOLDSTONE 
Come, sweet cousin.

BUNGLER 
Nay, cousin; keep your way, cousin; good cousin, I will not, i'faith, cousin.

Exeunt.


[IV.vii. A room in Mistress Newcut's house]
[Marmaduke is discovered laying the tablecloth.] Enter Mistress Newcut.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Why, how now, sirrah? Upon twelve of the clock, and not the cloth laid yet? Must we needs keep Exchange time still?

MARMADUKE 
I am about it, forsooth.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
You're about it, forsooth? You're still about many things, but you ne'er do one well. I am an ass to keep thee in th' house, now my husband's at sea; thou hast no audacity with thee; a foolish, dreaming lad, fitter to be in the garret than in any place else; no grace nor manly behaviour: when didst thou ever come to me but with thy head hanging down? O decheerful 'prentice, uncomfortable servant!

[Exit Marmaduke.]

Pray heaven the gull, my cousin, has so much wit left as to bring Master Tailby along with him--my comfort, my delight!--for that was the chiefest cause I did invite him. I bade him bring what gentleman he pleased to accompany him; as far as I durst go: why may he not then make choice of Master Tailby? Had he my wit or feeling he would do't.

Enter Bungler, and Goldstone disguised.

BUNGLER 
Where's my sweet cousin here? Does she lack any guests?

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Ever such guess as you: you're welcome, cousin.

GOLDSTONE 
I am rude, lady.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
You're most welcome, sir.

BUNGLER 
There will be a gallant here anon, coz; he promised faithfully.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Who is't? Master Tailby?

BUNGLER 
Master Tailby? No, Master Goldstone.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Master Goldstone? I could think well of that Goldstone were't not for one vild trick he has.

GOLDSTONE 
What's that, lady?

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
In jest he will pawn his punks for supper.

GOLDSTONE 
That's a vild part in him, i'faith, and he my were brother.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Pray, gentlemen, sit awhile; your dinner shall come presently.

Exit.

GOLDSTONE 
[Aside] Yes, Mistress Newcut? At first give me a trip? 
A close bite always asks a secret nip.

BUNGLER 
My cousin here is a very kind-natured soul, i'faith, in her humour.

GOLDSTONE 
Pooh, you know her not so well as I, coz; I have observed her in all her humours; you ne'er saw her a little waspish, I think.

BUNGLER 
I have [not], i'faith.

GOLDSTONE 
Pooh, then ye ne'er saw pretty humour in your life; I can bring her into't when I list.

BUNGLER 
Would you could, i'faith!

GOLDSTONE 
Would I could? By my troth, and I were sure thou couldst keep thy countenance, coz, what a pretty jest have I thought upon already to entertain time dinner!

BUNGLER 
Prithee, coz, what is't? I love a jest a' life, i'faith.

GOLDSTONE 
Ah, but I am jealous you will not keep your countenance, i'faith! Why, ye shall see a pretty story of a humour. Faith, I'll try you for once: you know my cousin will wonder when she comes in to see the cloth laid, and ne'er a salt upon the board.

BUNGLER 
That's true, i'faith.

GOLDSTONE 
Now will I stand a while out of sight with it, and give her humour play a little.

BUNGLER 
Coz, dost thou love me? And thou wilt ever do anything for me, do't.

GOLDSTONE 
Marry, I build upon you[r] countenance.

BUNGLER 
Why, dost thou think I'm an ass, coz?

GOLDSTONE 
I would be loath to undertake it else; for if you should burst out presently, coz, the jest would be spoiled.

BUNGLER 
Why, do not I know that? Away, stand close!

Exit Goldstone with the salt-cellar.

So, so; mum, cousin. A merry companion, i'faith: here will be good sport anon. Whist, she comes.

Enter Mistress Newcut.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
I make you [stay] long for a bad dinner here, cousin; if Master Goldstone were come, the meat's e'en ready.

BUNGLER 
Some great business detains him, cousin, but he'll not be long now.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Why, how now? Cuds my life!

BUNGLER 
Why--

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Was ever mistress so plagued with a shuttle-headed servant! Why, Marmaduke!

Enter Marmaduke.

MARMADUKE 
I come, forsooth.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Able to shame me from generation to generation!

MARMADUKE 
Did you call, forsooth?

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Come hither, forsooth: did you lay this cloth?

MARMADUKE 
Yes, forsooth.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Do you use to lay a cloth without a salt, a salt, a salt, a salt, a salt, a salt!

MARMADUKE 
How many salts would you have? I'm sure I set the best I' the house upon the board.

BUNGLER 
How, cousin? [Singing] "Cousin, cousin, did call, coz?"

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Did you see a salt upon the board when you came in?

BUNGLER 
Pooh!

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Come, come, I thought as much; beshrew your fingers, where is't now?

BUNGLER 
Your cousin yonder--

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Why, the man's mad!

BUNGLER 
Cousin, hist, cousin!

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
What say you?

BUNGLER 
Pooh, I call not you, I call my cousin. Come forth with the salt, cousin! Ha! How? Nobody? Why, was not he that came in e'en now your cousin?

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
My cousin? O my bell-salt, O my great bell-salt!

Enter Goldstone in his own dress.

BUNGLER 
The tenor bell-salt. O, here comes Master Goldstone now, cousin; he may tell us some news on him. [To Goldstone] Did you not meet a fellow about door with a great silver salt under his arm?

GOLDSTONE 
No, sure; I met none such.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Pardon me, sir, I forgot all this while to bid you welcome. I shall loath this room for ever. Take hence the cloth, you unlucky, maple-faced rascal! Come, you shall dine in my chamber, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
No better place, lady.

Exeunt.


[IV.viii. A street]
Enter Pyamont.

PYAMONT 
No less than forty pound in fair gold at one lift! The next shall swoon and swoon again till the devil fetch him, ere I set hand to him. Heart, nothing vexes me so much, but that I paid the goldsmith for the change too not an hour before: had I let it alone in the chain of silver as it was at first, it might have given me some notice at his departure: 'sfoot, I could fight with a windmill now. Sure 'twas some unlucky villain: why should he come and salute me wrongfully too, mistake me at noonday? Now I think on't in cold blood, it could not be but an induction to some villainous purpose: well, I shall meet him--

Enter Pursenet.

PURSENET 
This forty pound came fortunately to redeem my chain of pearl from mortgage: I would not care how often I swooned to have such a good caudle to comfort me; gold and pearl is very restorative.

PYAMONT 
See, yonder's the rogue I suspect for foul play! I'll walk muffled by him, offer some offence or cause of a quarrel, only to try his temper; if he be a coward, he's the likelier to be a rogue, an infallible note.

Jostles Pursenet.

PURSENET 
What a pox ail you, sir? Would I had been aware of you!

PYAMONT 
Sir, speak you to me?

PURSENET 
Not I, sir: pray, keep on your way; I have nothing to say to you.

PYAMONT 
You're a rascal!

PURSENET 
You may say your pleasure, sir; but I hope I go not like a rascal.

PYAMONT 
Are you fain to fly to your clothes because you're gallant? Why, there's no rascal like your gallant rascal, believe that.

PURSENET 
You have took me at such an hour, faith, you may call me e'en what you please; nothing will move me.

PYAMONT 
No? I'll make somewhat move you. Draw! I suspected you were a rogue, and you have purs'd it up well with a coward!

PURSENET 
Who, my patron?

PYAMONT 
Keep out, you rascal!

PURSENET 
The guest that did me the kindness in Paul's? Hold, as you are a gentleman; you'll give me breath, sir?

Exit running; as he goes out, he drops the chain of pearl.

PYAMONT 
Are you there with me? A vengeance stop you! You have found breath enough to run away from me. I will never meet this slave hereafter in a morning, but I will breathe myself upon him; since I can have no other satisfaction, he shall save me that forty pound in fence-school.

Exit. Enter Goldstone.

GOLDSTONE 
When things are cleanly carried, sign of judgment: 
I was the welcom'st gallant to her alive 
After the salt was stolen; then a good dinner, 
A fine provoking meal, which drew on apace 
The pleasure of a day-bed, and I had it; 
This here one ring can witness: when I parted, 
Who but "sweet Master Goldstone?" 
I left her in that trance. What cannot wit, 
So it be impudent, devise and compass? 
I'd fain know that fellow now 
That would suspect me but for what I am; 
He lives not: 'tis all in the conveyance. 
What, thou look'st not like a beggar: 
What mask'st thou on the ground? 
I've a hand to help thee up: a fair chain of pearl!

[Takes up the chain of pearl which Pursenet had dropped.]

Surely a merchant's wife gives lucky handsel: 
They that find pearl may wear't at a cheap rate; 
Marry, my lady dropp'd it from her arm 
For a device to tole me to her bed: 
I've seen as great a matter. Who be these? 
I'll be too crafty for you.

Enter Primero and Frippery.

O Monsieur Primero, Signior Frip; is it you, gallants?

FRIPPERY 
Sweet Master Goldstone!

[They talk apart.] Enter Tailby and two Constables.

TAILBY 
Every bawd exceeds me in fortune: Master Primero was robbed of a carkanet upon Monday last; laid the goldsmiths, and found it. I ha' laid [goldsmith], jeweller, burnisher, broker, and the devil and all, I think, yet could never so much as hear of that chain of pearl: he was a notable thief; he works close. Peace, who be these? Ha, let me see. By this light, there it is! Back, lest they see thee: a happy minute! Goldstone? What an age do we breathe in! Who that saw him now would think he were maintained by purses? So, who that meets me would think I were maintained by wenches? As far as I can see, 'tis all one case, and holds both in one court; we are both maintained by the common roadway! Keep thou thine own heart, thou livest unsuspected. I leese you again now.

GOLDSTONE 
But, I pray you, tell me, met you no gentlewomen by the way you came?

FRIPPERY 
Not any: what should they be?

GOLDSTONE 
Nay, I do but ask, because a gentlewoman's glove was found near to the place I met you.

PRIMERO 
Faith, we saw none, sir.

TAILBY 
Good officers, upon suspicion of felony.

SECOND CONSTABLE 
Very good, sir.

FIRST CONSTABLE 
What call you the thief's name you do suspect?

TAILBY 
Master Justinian Goldstone.

FIRST CONSTABLE 
Remember, Master Justinian Goldstone; a terrible world the whilst, my masters!

TAILBY 
Look you, that's he: upon him, officers!

FIRST CONSTABLE 
I see him not yet; which is he, sir?

TAILBY 
Why, that.

FIRST CONSTABLE 
He a thief, sir? Who, that gentleman i' th' satin?

TAILBY 
E'en he.

FIRST CONSTABLE 
Farewell, sir; you're a merry gentleman.

TAILBY 
As you will answer it, officers! I'll bear you out, I'll be your warrant.

FIRST CONSTABLE 
Nay, and you say so. What's his name then?

TAILBY 
Justinian Goldstone.

[The Constables approach and seize Goldstone.]

FIRST CONSTABLE 
Master Justinian Goldstone, we apprehend you, sir, upon suspicion of felony.

GOLDSTONE 
Me?

TAILBY 
You, sir.

[Goldstone struggles.]

SECOND CONSTABLE 
I charge you, in the king's name, gentlemen, to assist us.

GOLDSTONE 
Master Tailby!

TAILBY 
The same man, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
Life, what's the news?

TAILBY 
Ha' you forgot Combe Park?

GOLDSTONE 
Combe Park? No, 'tis in Kingston way.

TAILBY 
I believe you'll find it so.

GOLDSTONE 
I not deny it.

FIRST CONSTABLE 
Bear witness, has confessed.

GOLDSTONE 
What have I confessed? Pair of coxcombs indubitable!

TAILBY 
I was robb'd finely of this chain of pearl there, and forty fair spur-royals.

GOLDSTONE 
Did I rob you?

TAILBY 
There where I find my goods I may suspect, sir.

FRIPPERY 
I dreamt this would be his end.

GOLDSTONE 
See how I am wrong'd, gentlemen: as I've a soul, I found this chain of pearl not three yards from this place, just when I met you.

TAILBY 
Ha, ha!

FRIPPERY 
Yet the law's such, if he but swear 'tis you, you're gone.

GOLDSTONE 
Pox on't, that e'er I saw't!

FRIPPERY 
Can you but swear 'tis he? Do but that, and you tickle him, i'faith.

TAILBY 
Nay, and it come once to swearing, let me alone.

FRIPPERY 
Say, and hold; he called my jewels counterfeit, and so cheated the poor wench of 'em.

FIRST CONSTABLE 
Come, bring him away, come.

GOLDSTONE 
'Twill call my state in question.

Enter Pursenet.

PURSENET 
[Aside] I think what's got by theft doth never prosper; 
Now lost my chain of pearl.--Come, Master Goldstone, 
Let go this; 'tis mine, i'faith.

GOLDSTONE 
The chain of pearl?

PURSENET 
By my troth, it's mine.

GOLDSTONE 
By my troth, much good do't you, sir.

FRIPPERY 
I'm glad in my soul, sir.

FIRST CONSTABLE 
Deliver your weapons.

PURSENET 
How!

FIRST CONSTABLE 
You're apprehended upon suspicion of felony.

PURSENET 
Felony! What's that?

TAILBY 
Was it you, i'faith, sir, all this while, that did me that kindness to ease both my pockets at Combe Park?

PURSENET 
I, sir? 
Pray, gentlemen, draw near; let's talk among ourselves. 
[To First Constable] Stand apart, scoundrel. [To the gallants] 
Must every gentleman 
Be upbraided in public that flies out 
Now and then upon necessity, 
To be themes for pedlars and weavers? This should 
Not be: 'twas never seen among the Romans, 
Nor read we of it in the time of Brute: 
Are we more brutish now? 
Did I list to blab, do not I know your course 
Of life, Master Tailby to be as base 
As the basest, maintained by me, by him, by all 
Of us, and 'a second-hand from mistresses? 
I've their letters here to show. 
Why should you be so violent to strip naked 
Another's reputation to the world, 
Knowing your own so leprous? 
Beside, this chain of pearl and those spur-royals 
Came to you falsely; for she broke her faith, 
And made her soul a strumpet with her body, 
When she sent those; they were ever justly mine. 
[To Primero] Pray, what moves you, sir? Why should you shake your head? 
You're clear; sure I should know you, sir: pray, are you not sometimes a pander, and oftener a bawd, sir? Have I never sinned in your banqueting boxes, your bowers and towers? You slave, that keeps fornication upon the tops of trees, the very birds cannot engender in quiet for you! Why, rogue, that goes in good clothes made out of wenches' cast gowns--

PRIMERO 
Nothing goes so near my heart as that.

PURSENET 
Do you shake your slave's noddle?

TAILBY 
And here's a rascal [look'st] away too--saving the presence of Master Goldstone--a filthy-slimy-lousy-nittical broker, pricked up in pawns from the hat-band to the shoe-string; a necessary hook to hang gentlemen's suits out i' th' air, lest they should grow musty with long lying, which his pawns seldom are guilty of; a fellow of several scents and steams, French, Dutch, Italian, English, and therefore his lice must needs be mongrels: why, bill-money--

GOLDSTONE 
I am sorry to hear this among you: you've all deceived me; truly I took you for other spirits. You must pardon me henceforward; I have a reputation to look to; I must be no more seen in your companies.

FRIPPERY 
Nay, nay, nay, nay, Master Goldstone, you must not 'scape so, i'faith, one word before you go, sir.

GOLDSTONE 
Pray, despatch then; I would not for half my revenues, i'faith, now, that any gallants should pass by in the meantime, and find me in your companies; nay, as quick as you can, sir.

FRIPPERY 
You did not take away Master Bouser's cloak t'other morning, pawned it to me, and borrowed five pound upon't?

GOLDSTONE 
Ha!

FRIPPERY 
'Twas not you neither that finely cheated my little novice at Master Primero's house of a diamond and sapphire, and swore they were counterfeit, both glass, mere glass, as you were a right gentleman?

GOLDSTONE 
'Slife, why were we strangers all this while? 'Sfoot, I perceive we are all natural brothers! A pox on's all, are we found, i'faith?

FRIPPERY 
A cheater!

GOLDSTONE 
A thief, a lecher, a bawd, and a broker!

FIRST CONSTABLE 
What mean they to be so merry? I'm afraid they laugh at us, and make fools on's.

GOLDSTONE 
Push, leave it to me. [To First Constable] How now, who would you speak withal?

FIRST CONSTABLE 
Speak withal! Have we waited all this while for a suspected thief?

GOLDSTONE 
How? You're scarce awake yet, I think: look well, does any appear like a thief in this company? Away, you slaves! You stand loitering when you should look to the commonwealth: you catch knaves apace now, do you not? They may walk by your nose, you rascals!

Exeunt Constables.

ALL 
Sweet Master Goldstone!

GOLDSTONE 
You lacked spirit in your company till I came among you: here be five on's; let's but glue together, why now the world shall not come between us.

PURSENET 
If we be true among ourselves.

GOLDSTONE 
Why, true; we cannot lack to be rich, for we cannot lack riches, nor can our wenches want, nor we want wenches.

PRIMERO 
Let me alone to furnish you with them.

TAILBY 
And me.

GOLDSTONE 
There's one care past: and as for the knight's daughter, 
Our chiefest business, and least thought upon--

PURSENET 
That's true, i'faith.

TAILBY 
How shall we agree for her?

GOLDSTONE 
With as much ease as for the rest. Tomorrow 
Brings the night: let's all appear in the best shape 
We may; troth is, we have need on't: and when 
Amongst us five she makes election, 
As one she shall choose--

PURSENET 
True, she cannot [but] choose.

GOLDSTONE 
That one so fortunate amongst us five 
Shall bear himself more portly, live regarded, 
Keep house, and be a countenance to the rest.

ALL 
[Admirable]!

GOLDSTONE 
For instance; 
[To Pursenet] Put case yourself, after some robbery done, 
Were pursu'd hardly, why, there were your shelter, 
You know your sanctuary; nay, say you were taken, 
His letter to the justice will strike't dead: 
'Tis policy to receive one for the head.

ALL 
Let's hug thee, Goldstone.

GOLDSTONE 
What have I begot?

PURSENET 
What, sir?

GOLDSTONE 
I must plot for you all; it likes me rarely.

TAILBY 
Prithee, what is't, sir?

GOLDSTONE 
'Twould strike Fitsgrave pale, 
And make the other suitors appear blanks.

FRIPPERY 
For our united mysteries.

GOLDSTONE 
What if we five presented our full shapes 
In a strange, gallant and conceited masque?

PURSENET 
In a masque? Your thoughts and mine were twins.

TAILBY 
So the device were subtle, nothing like it.

FRIPPERY 
Some poet must assist us.

GOLDSTONE 
Poet? 
You'll take the direct line to have us stag'd? 
Why, what lacks Bouser? Are you too well, too safe? 
An absolute scholar; easy to be wrought, 
No danger in the operation.

PURSENET 
But have you so much interest?

GOLDSTONE 
What, in Bouser? 
Why, my least word commands him.

TAILBY 
Then no man fitter.

PURSENET 
And there's Master Frip, too, 
Can furnish us of masquing suits enow.

FRIPPERY 
Upon sufficient pawn, I think I can, sir.

PURSENET 
Pawn? Jew, here, take my chain: pawns among brothers? 
We shall thrive! But we must still expect 
One rogue in five, and think us happy, too.

Enter Fitsgrave.

GOLDSTONE 
Last man we spoke on, Master Bouser.

ALL 
Little Master Bouser, sweet Master Bouser, welcome, i'faith.

FITSGRAVE 
Are your fathers dead, gentlemen, you're so merry?

GOLDSTONE 
By my troth, a good jest! Did not I commend his wit to you, gentlemen? Hark, sirrah Ralph Bouser, cousin Bouser, i'faith, there's a kind of portion in town, a girl of fifteen hundred, whom we all powerfully affect, and determine to present our parts to her in a masque.

FITSGRAVE 
In a masque.

GOLDSTONE 
Right, sir: now, a little of thy brain for a device to present us firm, which we shall never be able to do ourselves, thou knowest that; and with a kind of speech wherein thou mayst express what gallants are, bravely.

FITSGRAVE 
Pooh, how can I express 'em otherwise but bravely? Now for a Mercury, and all were fitted.

PURSENET 
Could not a boy supply it?

FITSGRAVE 
Why, none better.

PURSENET 
I have a boy shall put down all the Mercuries i' th' town; 'a will play a Mercury naturally, at his fingers' end[s], i'faith.

FITSGRAVE 
Why, then we are suited: for torch-bearers and shield-boys, those are always the writer's properties; you're not troubled with them.

GOLDSTONE 
Come, my little Bouser, do't finely now, to the life.

FITSGRAVE 
I warrant you, gentlemen.

FRIPPERY 
[Aside to Fitsgrave] Hist; give me a little touch above the rest, and you can possible, for I mean to present this chain of pearl to her.

FITSGRAVE 
[Aside to Frippery] Now I know that, let me alone to fit you.

Exeunt.


V.[i. A chamber]
Enter Courtesans and Mistress Newcut.

FIRST COURTESAN 
Come forth, you wary, private whispering strumpet! 
Have we found your close haunts, 
Your private watch-towers, and your subtle means?

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
How then?

SECOND COURTESAN 
You can steal secretly hither, 
You mystical quean you, at twilight, twitter-lights! 
You have a privilege from your hat, forsooth, 
To walk without a man, and no suspicion; 
But we poor gentlewomen that go in tires 
Have no such liberty, we cannot do thus: 
Custom grants that to you that's shame in us.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Have you done yet?

SECOND COURTESAN 
You broke the back of one husband already; 
And now th' other's dead with grief at sea, 
With your secret expenses, close stealths, cunning 
Filches, and continued banquets in corners. 
Then, forsooth, you must have your milk-baths to white you, 
Your roseleaves to sweeten you, 
Your bean-flour bags to sleek you, and make you soft, 
Smooth, and delicate, for lascivious entertainment

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
So, and you think all this while you dance like a thief in a mist, you're safe, nobody can find you! Pray, were not you a feltmonger's daughter at first, that run away with a new courtier for the love of gentlewomen's clothes, and bought the fashion at a dear rate, with the loss of your name and credit? Why, what are all of you but rustical insides and city flesh, the blood of yeomen, and the bum of gentlewomen?

SECOND COURTESAN 
What, shall we suffer a changeable forepart out-tongue us? Take that!

[They attack her.]

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Murder, murder!

Enter Fitsgrave.

FITSGRAVE 
How now! Why, ladies, a retreat! Come, 
You have shown your spirits sufficiently: 
You're all land-captains; and so they shall find 
That come in your quarters; but have you the law 
Free now to fight and scratch among yourselves, 
And let your gallants run away with [others]?

FIRST COURTESAN 
How!

SECOND COURTESAN 
Good--

FIRST COURTESAN 
Sweet Master Bouser!

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Another?

FITSGRAVE 
Why then, I perceive you know nothing: why, they are in the way of marriage; a knight's daughter here in town makes her election among 'em this night.

FIRST COURTESAN 
This night?

FITSGRAVE 
This very night; and they all present themselves in a masque before her: know you not this?

SECOND COURTESAN 
O traitor Master Goldstone!

THIRD COURTESAN 
Perjured Master Tailby!

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Without soul?

FIRST COURTESAN 
She will chase him!

FITSGRAVE 
You have more cause to join, 
And play the grounds of friendship 'mongst yourselves, 
Than rashly run division: I could tell you 
A means to pleasure you--

FIRST COURTESAN 
Good Master Bouser!

FITSGRAVE 
But that you're women, and are hardly secret--

SECOND COURTESAN 
We vow it seriously.

FITSGRAVE 
You should be all there in presence, 
See all, hear all, and yet not they perceive you.

THIRD COURTESAN 
So that--

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
Sweet Master Bouser, I--

FITSGRAVE 
I can 
Stand you in stead; for I frame the device.

ALL 
If ever--

FITSGRAVE 
Will you do't? Hark you-- [Whispers.]

FIRST COURTESAN 
Content.

SECOND COURTESAN 
And I'll make one.

THIRD COURTESAN 
And I another: 
We'll mar the match.

[MISTRESS NEWCUT] 
When that good news came of my husband's death, 
Goldstone promis'd me marriage, and sware to me--

SECOND COURTESAN 
I'll bring his oaths in question.

THIRD COURTESAN 
So will I.

FITSGRAVE 
Agree among yourselves, for shame!

FIRST COURTESAN 
Are we 
Resolv'd?

SECOND COURTESAN 
In this who would not feign?

THIRD COURTESAN 
Friends all, 
For my part.

[MISTRESS NEWCUT] 
Here's my lip for mine.

THIRD COURTESAN 
Round let it go.

SECOND COURTESAN 
All wrath thus quench'd.

FIRST COURTESAN 
And I conclude it so.

Exeunt [all except Fitsgrave].

FITSGRAVE 
How all events strike even with my wishes! 
Their own invention damns them.

[Enter two Gentlemen, Pyamont, and Bungler.]

Now, gentlemen, 
Stands your assistance firm?

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
Why, 'tis our own case; 
I'm sorry you should doubt.

SECOND GENTLEMAN 
We'll furnish you.

Enter Painter with shields.

[BUNGLER] 
Are these our gallants?

FITSGRAVE 
Are our gallants these?

PAINTER 
Here be five shields, sir.

FITSGRAVE 
Finished already? That's well: I'll see thy master shortly.

PAINTER 
I'm satisfied.

Exit.

PYAMONT 
Prithee, let's see, Master Fitsgrave.

FITSGRAVE 
I have blazed them.

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
What's this?

[SECOND GENTLEMAN] 
Fooh, you should be a gallant too, for you're no university scholar.

FITSGRAVE 
Look, this is Pursenet; the device, a purse wide open, and the mouth downward: the word, Alienis ecce crumensis!

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
What's that?

FITSGRAVE 
"One that lives out of other men's pockets."

PYAMONT 
That's right!

FITSGRAVE 
Here's Goldstone's, three silver dice.

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
They run high, two cinques and a quater!

FITSGRAVE 
They're high-men, fit for his purpose; the word, Fratremque patremque.

SECOND GENTLEMAN 
Nay, he will cheat his own brother; nay, his own father, i'faith!

FITSGRAVE 
So much the word imports. Master Primero.

[BUNGLER] 
Pox, what says he now?

FITSGRAVE 
The device, an unvalued pearl hid in a cave; the word, Occul[t]os vendit honores.

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
What's that?

FITSGRAVE 
"One that sells maidenheads by wholesale."

SECOND GENTLEMAN 
Excellently proper!

FITSGRAVE 
Master Frip.

SECOND GENTLEMAN 
That Pythagorical rascal! In a gentleman's suit today, in a knight's tomorrow.

FITSGRAVE 
The device for him, a cuckoo sitting on a tree the word, En avis ex avibus, "one bird made of many!" For you know as the sparrow hatches the cuckoo, so the gentleman feathers the broker.

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
Let me admire thee, Master Fitsgrave!

FITSGRAVE 
They will scorn, gentlemen; and to assist them the better, Pursenet's boy, that little precious pickpocket, has a compendious speech in Latin, and, like a Mercury, presents their dispositions more liberally.

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
Never were poor gallants so abused.

FITSGRAVE 
Hang 'em! They're counterfeits; 
No honest spirit will pity 'em. This is my crown; 
So good men smile, I dread no rascal's frown. 
Away, bestow yourselves secretly o'erhead; 
This is the place appointed for the rehearsal, 
To practise their behaviours.

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
We are vanish'd.

[Exeunt the two Gentlemen, Pymont, and Bungler, who hide themselves above.] Enter Goldstone, Pursenet, Tailby, Frippery, Primero, and Boy.

GOLDSTONE 
Master Bouser.

PURSENET 
Well said, i'faith; off with your cloaks, gallants; let's fall roundly to our business.

TAILBY 
Is the boy perfect?

FITSGRAVE 
That's my credit, sir, I warrant you.

FRIPPERY 
If our little Mercury should be out, we should scarce be known what we are.

FITSGRAVE 
I have took a course for that, fear it not, sir. Look you, first, here be your shields.

GOLDSTONE 
Ay, where be our shields?

PURSENET 
Which is mine?

TAILBY 
Which is mine, Master Bouser? This?

FITSGRAVE 
I pray, be contained a little, gentlemen; they'll come all time enough to you, I warrant.

PURSENET 
This Frip is grown so violent!

FITSGRAVE 
Yours to begin withal, sir.

PURSENET 
Well said, Master Bouser!

[FITSGRAVE] 
First the device, a fair purse wide open, the mouth downward; the word, Alienis ecce crumenis!

PURSENET 
What's that, prithee?

FITSGRAVE 
"Your bounty pours itself forth to all men."

PURSENET 
And so it does, i'faith; that's all my fault, bountiful.

FITSGRAVE 
Master Goldstone, here's yours, sir; three silver dice; the word, Fratremque patremque.

GOLDSTONE 
And what's that?

FITSGRAVE 
"Fortune of my side."

GOLDSTONE 
Well said, little Bouser, i'faith!

TAILBY 
What say you to me, sir?

FITSGRAVE 
For the device, a candle in a corner; the word, Consumptio victis.

TAILBY 
The meaning of that, sir?

FITSGRAVE 
"My light is yet in darkness till I enjoy her."

[TAILBY] 
Right, sir.

PRIMERO 
Now mine, sir?

FITSGRAVE 
The device, an unvalued pearl hid in a cave.

PRIMERO 
Aha, sirs!

FITSGRAVE 
The word, Occultos vendit honores.

PRIMERO 
Very good, I warrant.

FITSGRAVE 
"A black man's a pearl in a fair lady's eye."

PRIMERO 
I said 'twas some such thing.

FRIPPERY 
My turn must need come now: am I fitted, Master Bouser?

FITSGRAVE 
Trust to me: your device here is a cuckoo sitting on a tree.

FRIPPERY 
The Welsh leiger; good.

FITSGRAVE 
The word, En avis ex avibus!

FRIPPERY 
Ay, marry, sir.

FITSGRAVE 
Why, do you know what 'tis, sir?

FRIPPERY 
No, by my troth, not yet, sir.

FITSGRAVE 
O! "I keep one tune, I recant not."

FRIPPERY 
I'm like the cuckoo in that indeed: where I love, I hold.

FITSGRAVE 
Did I not promise you I would fit you?

GOLDSTONE 
They're all very well done, i'faith, and very scholarlike, though I say't before thy face, little Bouser; but I would not have thee proud on't now: come, if this be performed well--

PURSENET 
Who, the boy? He has performed deeper matters than this.

PYAMONT 
[Aside] Ay, a pox on him! I think was in my pocket now, and truth were known.

BUNGLER 
[Aside] I caught him once in mine.

FITSGRAVE 
Suppose the shields are presented, then you begin, boy.

BOY 
I representing Mercury, am a pickpocket, and have his part at my fingers' ends: "Page I am to that great and secret thief, magno illo et secreto latroni--"

[FITSGRAVE] 
There you make your honour, sir.

BOY 
At latroni?

[FITSGRAVE] 
You have it, sir.

[PURSENET] 
Latroni, that's mine.

FITSGRAVE 
[Aside] He confesses the thief's his.

PURSENET 
Remember, boy, you point latroni to me.

BOY 
To you, master.

[FITSGRAVE] 
Proceed.

[BOY] 
"These four are his companions; the one a notable cheater, that will cozen his own father--"

FITSGRAVE 
Master Goldstone.

GOLDSTONE 
Let me alone, Master Bouser; I can take mine own turn.

FITSGRAVE 
Why--

GOLDSTONE 
Peace.

[BOY] 
"The second a notorious lecher, maintained by harlots, cujus virtus consumptio corpus."

TAILBY 
That's I, Master Bouser.

FITSGRAVE 
There you remember your honour, sir.

BOY 
"Ille leno pretiosissimus, virgineos ob lucrum vendens honores."

PURSENET 
It sounds very well, i'faith.

BOY 
"Postremus ille, quamvis apparatu splendidus, is no other than a broker; these feathers are not his own, sed avis ex avibus: all which to be nothing but truth will appear by the event."

FITSGRAVE 
I'faith, here's all now, gentlemen.

GOLDSTONE 
Short and pithy.

TAILBY 
A good boy, i'faith, and a pregnant!

PURSENET 
I dare put trust in the boy, sir. [To Boy] Forget not, sirrah, at any hand, to point that same latroni to me.

BOY 
I warrant you, master.

GOLDSTONE 
Come, gentlemen, the time beckons us away.

FITSGRAVE 
Ay, furnish, gentlemen, furnish.

PURSENET 
Hark, one word, Master Bouser: what's the same latroni? I have a good mind to that word, i'faith.

FITSGRAVE 
Latroni? Why, "[shrieve] of the shire."

PURSENET 
I'faith, and I have shriven some shires in my days.

Exeunt Goldstone, Pursenet, Tailby, Frippery, Primero, and Boy.

FITSGRAVE 
Now, gentlemen, are you satisfied and pleas'd?

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
Never more amply.

FITSGRAVE 
Amongst us now falls that desired lot, 
For we shall blast five rivals with one plot.

[Exeunt.]


[V.ii. A hall in Katherine's house]
Enter Katherine between two ancient Gentlemen.

KATHERINE 
Grave gentlemen, in whose approved bosoms 
My deceas'd father did repose much faith, 
You're dearly welcome: pray, sit, command music; 
See nothing want to beautify this night, 
That holds my election in her peaceful arms; 
Feasts, music, hymns, those sweet celestial [charms].

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
May you be blest in this election.

SECOND GENTLEMAN 
That content may meet perfection.

HYMN 
Sound lute, bandora gittern, 
Viol, virginals, and cittern; 
Voices spring, and lift aloud 
Her name that makes the music proud! 
This night perfection 
Makes her election. 
Follow, follow, follow, follow round, 
Look you to that, nay, you to that, nay, you to that: 
Anon you will be found, anon you will be found, anon you will be found.
Cornets sound: enter the Masque, thus ordered: a torch-bearer, a shield-boy, then a masquer, so throughout; then the shield-boys fall at one end, the torch-bearers at the other; the masquers i' th' middle: the torch-bearers are the five gentlemen, the shield-boys the whores in boys' apparel; the masquers the five gallants: they bow to her; she rises and shows the like: they dance, but first deliver the shields up; she reads. The speech: their action.

KATHERINE 
[Reads] "Alienis ecce crumenis!"

[Pursenet bows to her.]

[Reads] "Fratremque patremque."

[Goldstone bows to her.]

[Reads] "Consumptio victus."

[Tailby bows to her.]

[Reads] "Occultos vendit honores."

[Primero bows to her.]

A cuckoo: [reads] "En avis ex avibus!"

[Frippery bows to her.]

Are you all as the speech and shields display you?

GOLDSTONE 
We shall prove so.

They go to dance, each unhasps his weapon from his side, and gives it to the torch-bearers. Katherine seems distrustful, but then Fitsgrave whispers to her and falls back. At then end of which, all making an honour, Frippery presents her with the chain of pearl.

KATHERINE 
The very chain of pearl was filch'd from me!

[The Boy begins to sneak away.]

FITSGRAVE 
Hold! Stop the boy there!

Boy seized. Pursenet stamps.

KATHERINE 
Will none lay hands on him?

Frippery seized.

GOLDSTONE 
How now?

FRIPPERY 
Alas, I'm but a broker! 'Twas pawned to me in my shop.

Fitsgrave, Pyamont, and the others discover themselves.

TAILBY 
Ha, Fitsgrave!

PURSENET 
Pyamont, and the rest!

GOLDSTONE 
Where's Bouser?

FITSGRAVE 
Here.

GOLDSTONE 
We are all betrayed!

FITSGRAVE 
Betrayed? You're [not worthy to be] to betrayed, you have not so much worth: nay, struggle not with the net, you are caught for this world.

FIRST COURTESAN 
Would we were out!

FITSGRAVE 
'Twas I fram'd your device, do you see? 'Twas I! 
The whole assembly has took notice of it. 
[To Goldstone] That you are a gallant cheater, 
So much the pawning of my cloak contains; 
[to Pursenet] You a base thief, think of Combe Park; [to Tailby] and tell me 
That you're a hired smockster; here's her letter, 
[to Primero] In which we are certified that you're a bawd.

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
The broker has confessed it.

SECOND GENTLEMAN 
So has the boy.

TAILBY 
That boy will be hanged; he stole the chain at first, 
And has thus long maintained his master's gallantry

FITSGRAVE 
All which we here present, like captive slaves, 
Waiting that doom which their presumption craves.

KATHERINE 
How easily may our suspectless sex 
With fair appearing shadows be deluded! 
Dear sir, you have the work so well begun, 
That took from you, small glory would be won.

FITSGRAVE 
Since 'tis your pleasure to refer to me 
The doom of these, I have provided so, 
They shall not altogether lose their cost: 
See, I have brought wives for 'em.

[The women of the masque discover themselves.]

GOLDSTONE 
Heart, the strumpets! Out, out!

TAILBY 
Having assum'd, out of their impudence, 
The shape of shield-boys!

FRIPPERY 
To heap full confusion!

FIRST COURTESAN 
Rather confine us to strict chastity, 
A mere impossible task, than to wed these, 
Whom we [do] loathe worse than the foul'st disease.

GOLDSTONE 
O grant 'em their requests!

FITSGRAVE 
The doom is past; so, since your aim was marriage, 
Either embrace it in these courtesans, 
Or have your base acts and felonious lives 
Proclaim'd to the indignation of the law, 
Which will provide a public punishment. 
As for the boy, and that infectious bawd, 
We put forth those to whipping.

PRIMERO 
Whipping? You find not that in the statute to whip satin.

FITSGRAVE 
Away with him!

[Primero and Boy led off.]

GOLDSTONE 
Since all our shifts are discovered, as far as I can see, 'tis our best course to marry 'em; we'll make them get our livings.

PURSENET 
He says true.

MISTRESS NEWCUT 
You see how we are threatened: by my troth, wenches, be ruled by me; let's marry 'em, and it be but to plague 'em; for when we have husbands we are under covert-baron, and may lie with whom we list! I have tried that in my t'other husband's days.

ALL THE COURTESANS 
A match.

FITSGRAVE 
I'll be no more deferr'd: come, when do you join?

GOLDSTONE 
These forc'd marriages do never come to good.

FITSGRAVE 
How can they when the[y] come to such as you?

PURSENET 
The[y] often prove the ruin of great houses.

[FITSGRAVE] 
Nor, virgin, do I in this seek to entice 
All glory to myself; these gentlemen, 
[Whom] I am bound to love for kind assistance, 
Had great affinity in the plot with me.

KATHERINE 
To them I give my thanks; myself to thee, 
Thrice-worthy Fitsgrave!

FITSGRAVE 
I have all my wishes.

KATHERINE 
And I presume there's none but those can frown, 
Whose envies, like the rushes, we tread down.

[Exeunt omnes.]
