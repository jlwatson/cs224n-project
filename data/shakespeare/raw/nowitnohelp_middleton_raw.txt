Prologue
How is't possible to suffice 
So many ears, so many eyes? 
Some in wit, some in shows 
Take delight, and some in clothes: 
Some for mirth they chiefly come, 
Some for passion, for both some; 
Some for lascivious meetings, that's their arrant; 
Some to detract, and ignorance their warrant. 
How is't possible to please 
Opinion toss'd in such wild seas? 
Yet I doubt it not, if attention 
Seize you above, and apprehension 
You below, to take things quickly, 
We shall both make you sad and tickle ye.


I.[i. A street]
Enter Philip, Sir Oliver Twilight's son, with Savorwit, his father's man.

PHILIP 
I am at my wit's end, Savorwit.

SAVORWIT 
And I am ev'n following after you as fast as I can, sir.

PHILIP 
My wife will be forc'd from me, my pleasure!

SAVORWIT 
Talk no more on't, sir. How can there be any 
Hope i' th' middle when we're both at our 
Wit's end in the beginning? My invention 
Was ne'er so gravel'd since I first set out upon't.

PHILIP 
Nor does my stop stick only in this wheel, 
Though it be a main vexation, but I'm grated 
In a dear absolute friend, young Master Sandfield--

SAVORWIT 
Ay, there's another rub too.

PHILIP 
Who supposes 
That I make love to his affected mistress, 
When 'tis my father works against the peace 
Of both our spirits, and woos unknown to me. 
He strikes out sparks of undeserved anger 
['Twixt] old steel friendship and new stony hate, 
As much forgetful of the merry hours 
The circuits of our youth hath spent and worn 
As if they had not been or we not born.

Enter Sandfield.

SAVORWIT 
See where he comes.

SANDFIELD 
Unmerciful in torment! 
Will this disease never forsake mine eye?

PHILIP 
It must be kill'd first if it grow so painful. 
Work it out strongly at one time that th' anguish 
May never more come near thy precious sight. 
If my eternal sleep will give thee rest, 
Close up mine eyes with opening of my breast.

SANDFIELD 
I feel thy wrongs at midnight and the weight 
Of thy close treacheries. Thou hast a friendship 
As dangerous as a strumpet's, that will kiss 
Men into poverty, distress, and ruin; 
And to make clear the face of thy foul deeds, 
Thou work'st by seconds.

[Draws his sword.]

PHILIP 
Then may the sharp point of an inward horror 
Strike me to earth, and save thy weapon guiltless!

SANDFIELD 
Not in thy father?

PHILIP 
How much is truth abus'd 
When 'tis kept silent!

[SANDFIELD] 
Oh, defend me friendship!

SAVORWIT 
True, your anger's in an error all this while, sir, 
But that a lover's weapon [ne'er] hears reason; 
'Tis out still like a mad man's. Hear but me, sir: 
'Tis my young master's injury, not yours, 
That you quarrel with him for, and this shows 
As if y' would challenge a lame man the field 
And cut off's head because he has lost his legs. 
His grief makes him dead flesh, as it appear'd 
By off'ring up his breast to you; for believe it, sir, 
Had he not greater crosses of his own, 
Your hilts could not cross him.

SANDFIELD 
How?

SAVORWIT 
Not your hilts, sir. 
Come, I must have you friends; a pox of weapons! 
There's a whore gapes for't; put it up i' th' scabbard.

SANDFIELD 
[Putting up his sword] Thou'rt a mad slave.

SAVORWIT 
Come, give me both your hands. 
Y'are in a quagmire both: should I release you now, 
Your wits would both come home in a stinking pickle; 
Your father's old nose would smell you out presently.

PHILIP 
Tell him the secret, which no mortal knows 
But thou and I, and then he will confess 
How much he wrong'd the patience of his friend.

SAVORWIT 
Then thus the marigold opens at the splendour 
Of a hot constant friendship 'twixt you both. 
'Tis not unknown to your ear some ten years since 
My mistress, his good mother, with a daughter 
About the age of six, crossing to [Jersey], 
Was taken by the Dunkirks, sold both, and separated, 
As the last news brings hot the first and last 
So much discover'd; for in nine years' space 
No certain tidings of their life or death 
Or what place held 'em, earth, the sea, or heaven, 
Came to the old man's ears, the knight my master, 
Till about five months since, a letter came, 
Sent from the mother, which related all 
Their taking, selling, separation, 
And never meeting; and withal required 
Six hundred crowns for ransom, which my old master 
No sooner heard the sound but told the sum, 
Gave him the gold, and sent us both aboard. 
We landing by the way, having a care 
To lighten us of our carriage because gold 
Is such a heavy metal, eas'd our pockets 
In wenches' aprons. Women were made to bear, 
But for us gentlemen, 'tis most unkindly.

SANDFIELD 
Well, sir?

PHILIP 
A pure rogue still!

SAVORWIT 
Amongst the rest, sir, 
'Twas my young master's chance there to dote finely 
Upon a sweet young gentlewoman, but one 
That would not sell her honour for the Indies, 
Till a priest struck the bargain, and then half a crown dispatch'd it. 
To be brief, wedded her and bedded her, 
Brought her home hither to his father's house, 
And with a fair tale of mine own bringing up, 
She passes for his sister that was sold.

SANDFIELD 
Let me not lose myself in wond'ring at thee. 
But how made you your score even for the mother?

SAVORWIT 
Pish, easily: we told him how her fortunes 
Mock'd us as they mock'd her. When we were o' th' sea, 
She was o' th' land, and as report was given, 
When we were landed, she was gone to heaven. 
So he believes two lies one error bred: 
The daughter ransom'd and the mother dead.

SANDFIELD 
Let me admire thee and withal confess 
My injuries to friendship.

PHILIP 
They're all pardon'd. 
[Embracing him] These are the arms I bore against my friend.

SAVORWIT 
But what's all this to th' present? This discourse 
Leaves you i' th' bog still.

PHILIP 
On, good Savorwit!

SAVORWIT 
For yet our policy has cross'd ourselves; 
For the old knave, my master, little thinking her 
Wife to his son, but his own daughter still, 
Seeks out a match for her--

PHILIP 
Here I feel the surgeon 
At second dressing.

SAVORWIT 
And h'as entertain'd 
Ev'n for pure need, for fear the glass should crack 
That is already broken, but well solder'd, 
A mere sot for her suitor, a rank fox, 
One Weatherwise, that woos by the almanac, 
Observes the full and change, an errant moon-calf. 
And yet, because the fool demands no portion 
But the bare down of her smock, the old fellow, 
Worn to the bone with a dry [covetous] itch, 
To save his purse and yet bestow his child, 
Consents to waste [her on] lumps of almanac stuff 
Kned with May-butter. Now as I have thought on't 
I'll spoil him in the baking.

SANDFIELD 
Prithee, as how, sirrah?

SAVORWIT 
I'll give him such a crack in one o' th' sides 
He shall quite run out of my master's favour.

PHILIP 
I should but too much love thee for that.

SAVORWIT 
Thus, then, 
To help you both at once, and so good night to you. 
After my wit has shipp'd away the fool, 
As he shall part, I'll buzz into the ear 
Of my old master that you, sir, Master Sandfield, 
Dearly affect his daughter and will take her 
With little or no portion. Well stood out in't! 
Methinks I see him caper at that news 
And in the full cry, oh! This brought about 
And wittily dissembled on both parts, 
You to affect his love, he to love yours, 
I'll so beguile the father at the marriage 
That each shall have his own, and both being welcom'd 
And chamber'd in one house, as 'tis his pride 
To have his children's children got successively 
On his forefathers' feather beds, in the day times, 
To please the old man's eyesight, you may dally 
And set a kiss on the wrong lip; no sin in't: 
Brothers and sisters do't, cousins do more, 
But pray take heed you be not kin to them. 
So in the night time nothing can deceive you, 
Let each know his own work, and there I leave you.

SANDFIELD 
Let me applaud thee.

PHILIP 
Bless'd be all thy ends 
That mak'st arm'd enemies embracing friends. 
About it speedily.

Exit [with Sandfield].

SAVORWIT 
I need no pricking. 
I'm of that mettle, so well-pac'd and free, 
There's no good riders that use spur to me.

Enter Grace Twilight.

Oh, are you come?

GRACE 
Are any comforts coming?

SAVORWIT 
I never go without 'em.

GRACE 
Thou sport'st joys that utterance cannot perfect.

SAVORWIT 
Hark, are they risen?

GRACE 
Yes, long before I left 'em. 
And all intend to bring the widow homeward.

SAVORWIT 
Depart then, mistress, to avoid suspect: 
Our good shall arrive time enough at your heart.

[Exit Grace.]

Poor fools that ever more take a green surfeit 
Of the first fruits of joys. Let a man but shake the tree, 
How soon they'll hold up their laps to receive comfort! 
The music that I struck made her soul dance. 
Peace!

Enter the Lady Widow Goldenfleece with Sir Gilbert Lambston, Master Pepperton, Master Overdon, suitors. After them, the two old men, Sir Oliver Twilight and Master Sunset, with their daughters, Grace Twilight [and] Jane Sunset.

[Aside] Here comes the Lady Widow, the late wife 
To the deceas'd Sir Avarice Goldenfleece, 
Second to none for usury and extortion, 
As too well it appears on a poor gentleman, 
One Master Low-water, from whose estate 
He pull'd that fleece that makes his widow weight. 
Those are her suitors now, Sir Gilbert Lambston, 
Master Pepperton, Master Overdon.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Nay, good Sir Oliver Twilight, Master Sunset, 
We'll trouble you no farther.

SUNSET, SIR OLIVER 
No trouble, sweet madam.

SIR GILBERT 
We'll see the widow at home; it shall be 
Our charge, that.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
It shall be so indeed. 
Thanks, good Sir Oliver, and to you both 
I am indebted for those courtesies 
That will ask me a long time to requite.

SIR OLIVER 
Ah, 'tis but your pleasant condition to give it out so, madam.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Mistress Grace and Mistress Jane, I wish you both 
A fair contented fortune in your choices, 
And that you happen right. 
[GRACE, JANE] 
Thanks to you, good madam.

[LADY GOLDENFLEECE] 
[Aside] There's more in that word "right" than you imagine.-- 
I now repent, girls, a rash oath I took 
When you were both infants, to conceal a secret.

GRACE 
What does't concern, good madam?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
No, no. 
Since you are both so well, 'tis well enough. 
It must not be reveal'd; 'tis now no more 
Than like mistaking of one hand for t'other. 
A happy time to you both.

[GRACE, JANE] 
The like to you, madam.

GRACE 
[Aside] I shall long much to have this riddle open'd.

JANE 
[Aside] I would you were so kind to my poor kinswoman 
And the distressed gentleman her husband, 
Poor Master Low-water, who on ruin leans. 
You keep this secret as you keep his means.

[LADY GOLDENFLEECE] 
Thanks, good Sir Oliver Twilight. Welcome, sweet 
Master Pepperton; Master Overdon, welcome.

Exeunt. Manet Sir Oliver with Savorwit.

SIR OLIVER 
And goes the business well 'twixt those young lovers?

SAVORWIT 
Betwixt your son and Master Sunset's daughter, 
The line goes even, sir.

SIR OLIVER 
Good lad, I like thee.

SAVORWIT 
But sir, there's no proportion, height, or evenness 
Betwixt that equinoctial and your daughter.

SIR OLIVER 
'Tis true, and I'm right glad on't.

SAVORWIT 
Are you glad, sir? 
There's no proportion in't.

SIR OLIVER 
Ay, marry, am I, sir. 
I can abide no word that ends in portion; 
I'll give her nothing.

SAVORWIT 
Say you should not, sir, 
As I'll ne'er urge your worship 'gainst your nature, 
Is there no gentleman, think you, of worth and credit 
Will open's bed to warm a naked maid? 
A hundred gallant fellows, and be glad 
To be so set a-work! Virginity 
Is no such cheap ware as you make account on 
That it had need with portion be set off, 
For that sets off a portion in these days.

SIR OLIVER 
Play on, sweet boy! 
Oh, I could hear this music all day long, 
When there's no money to be parted from! 
Strike on, good lad!

SAVORWIT 
Do not wise men and great often bestow 
Ten thousand pound in jewels that lie by 'em? 
If so, what jewel can lie by a man 
More precious than a virgin? If none more precious, 
Why should the pillow of a fool be grac'd 
With that brave spirits with dearness have embrac'd? 
And then, perhaps, ere the third spring come on, 
Sends home your diamond crack'd, the beauty gone; 
And more to know her, 'cause you shall not doubt her, 
A number of poor sparks twinkling about her.

SIR OLIVER 
Now thou play'st Dowland's Lachrymae to thy master.

SAVORWIT 
But shall I dry your eyes with a merry jig now 
And make you look like sunshine in a shower?

SIR OLIVER 
How, how, my honest boy, sweet Savorwit?

SAVORWIT 
Young Master Sandfield, gallant Master Sandfield--

SIR OLIVER 
Ha! What of him?

SAVORWIT 
Affects your daughter strangely.

SIR OLIVER 
Brave Master Sandfield! Let me hug thy zeal 
Unto thy master's house. Ha, Master Sandfield! 
But he'll expect a portion.

SAVORWIT 
Not a whit, sir, 
As you may use the matter.

SIR OLIVER 
Nay, and the matter fall into my using 
The devil a penny that he gets of me.

SAVORWIT 
He lies at the mercy of your lock and key, sir; 
You may use him as you list.

SIR OLIVER 
Say'st thou me so? 
Is he so far in doing?

SAVORWIT 
Quite over head and ears, sir. 
Nay, more: he means to run mad and break his neck 
Off some high steeple if he have her not.

SIR OLIVER 
Now bless the young gentleman's gristles; I hope 
To be a grandfather yet by 'em.

SAVORWIT 
That may you, sir, 
To, marry, a chopping girl with a plump buttock 
Will hoist a farthingale at five years old, 
And call a man between eleven and twelve 
To take part of a piece of mutton with her.

SIR OLIVER 
Ha, precious wag! Hook him in finely, do.

SAVORWIT 
Make clear the way for him first; set the gull going.

SIR OLIVER 
An ass, an ass! I'll quickly dash his wooing.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Why now the clocks 
Go right again. It must be a strange wit 
That makes the wheels of youth and age so hit; 
The one are dry, worn, rusty, furr'd, and soiled; 
Love's wheels are glib, ever kept clean and oil'd.

Exit.

SIR OLIVER 
I cannot choose but think of this good fortune: 
That gallant Master Sandfield!

Enter Weatherwise.

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside] Stay, stay, stay. 
What comfort gives my almanac today? 
Luck, I beseech thee! [Consulting his almanac] Good days, evil days, June, July; speak a good word for me now, and I have her. Let me see: "the fifth day, 'twixt hawk and buzzard; the sixth day, backward and forward." That was beastly to me, I remember. "The seventh day, on a slippery pin; the eighth day, fire and tow; the ninth day, the market is marr'd." That's long of the hucksters, I warrant you; but now "the tenth day." Luck, I beseech thee now before I look into't! "The eleventh day, against the hair." A pox on't! Would that hair had been left out! "Against the hair!" That hair will go nigh to choke me; had it been against anything but that, 'twould not have troubled me because it lies cross i' th' way. Well, I'll try the fortune of a good face yet, though my almanac leave me i' th' sands.

SIR OLIVER 
[Aside] Such a match, too. I could not wish a better.

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside] Mass, here he walks.--Save you, sweet Sir Oliver! Sir Oliver Twilight!

SIR OLIVER 
Oh, pray come to me a quarter of a year hence; I have a little business now.

WEATHERWISE 
How, a quarter of a year hence? What, shall I come to you in September?

SIR OLIVER 
Nor in November neither, good my friend.

WEATHERWISE 
Y'are not a mad knight; you will not let your daughter hang past August, will you? She'll drop down under tree then. She's no winter fruit, I assure you, if you think to put her in crust after Christmas.

SIR OLIVER 
Sir, in a word, depart: my girl's not for you; 
I gave you a drowsy promise in a dream, 
But broad awake now, I call't in again. 
Have me commended to your wit; farewell, sir.

[Exit.]

WEATHERWISE. 
Now the devil run away with you, and some lousy fiddler with your daughter! May Clerkenwell have the first cut of her and Hound's Ditch pick the bones! I'll never leave the love of an open-hearted widow for a narrow-ey'd maid again, go out of the roadway like an ass to leap over hedge and ditch: I'll fall into the beaten path again and invite the widow home to a banquet. Let who list seek out new ways, I'll be at my journey's end before him. 
My almanac told me true how I should fare; 
Let no man think to speed against the hair.

Exit.


[I.ii. Low-water's house]
Enter Mistress Low-water.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Is there no saving means? No help religious 
For a distressed gentlewoman to live by? 
Has virtue no revenue? Who has all then? 
Is the world's lease from hell, the devil head-landlord? 
Oh, how was conscience, the right heir, put by? 
Law would not do such an unrighteous deed, 
Though with the fall of angels 't had been fee'd. 
Where are our hopes in banks? Was honesty 
A younger sister without portion left? 
No dowry in the Chamber beside wantonness? 
O miserable orphan! 
'Twixt two extremes runs there no blessed mean, 
No comfortable strain that I may kiss it? 
Must I to whoredom or to beggary lean, 
My mind being sound? Is there no way to miss it? 
Is't not injustice that a widow laughs 
And lays her mourning part upon a wife? 
That she should have the garment, I the heart; 
My wealth her uncle left her, and me her grief? 
Yet, stood all miseries in their loathed'st forms 
On this hand of me, thick like a foul mist, 
And here the bright enticements of the world 
In clearest colours, flattery, and advancement, 
And all the bastard glories this frame jets in, 
Horror nor splendour, shadows fair nor foul 
Should force me shame my husband, wound my soul.

Enter Mistress Jane, Sunset's daughter.

Cousin, y'are welcome. This is kindly done of you 
To visit the despis'd.

JANE 
I hope not so, coz. 
The want of means cannot make you despis'd; 
Love not by wealth but by desert is priz'd.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Y'are pleas'd to help it well, coz.

JANE 
I am come to you, 
Beside my visitation, to request you 
To lay your wit to mine, which is but simple, 
And help me to untie a few dark words 
Made up in knots--they're of the widow's knitting, 
That ties all sure--for my wit has not strength 
Nor cunning to unloose 'em.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Good, what are they, 
Though there be little comfort of my help?

JANE 
She wish'd Sir Oliver's daughter and myself 
Good fortune in our choices and repented her 
Of a rash oath she took when we were both infants, 
A secret to conceal; but since all's well, 
She holds it best to keep it unreveal'd. 
Now what this is, heaven knows.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Nor can I guess. 
The course of her whole life and her dead husband's 
Was ever full of such dishonest riddles 
To keep right heirs from knowledge of their own. 
And now I'm put i' th' mind on't, I believe 
It was some [piece] of land or money given 
By some departing friend upon their deathbed, 
Perhaps to yourself, and Sir Oliver's daughter 
May wrongfully enjoy it, and she hired, 
For she was but an hireling in those days, 
To keep the injury secret.

JANE 
The most likeliest 
That ever you could think on.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Is it not?

JANE 
Sure, coz. I think you have untied the knot; 
My thoughts lie at more ease. As in all other things, 
In this I thank your help, and may you live 
To conquer your own troubles and cross ends, 
As you are ready to supply your friends.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I thank you for the kind truth of your heart, 
In which I flourish when all means depart. 
[Aside] Sure in that oath of hers there sleeps some wrong 
Done to my kinswoman.

Enter Footman.

JANE 
Who'd you speak withal?

FOOTMAN 
The gentlewoman of this house, forsooth.

JANE 
Whose footman are you?

FOOTMAN 
One Sir Gilbert Lambston's.

JANE 
Sir Gilbert Lambston's? There my cousin walks.

FOOTMAN 
Thank your good worship.

[Exit Jane.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
How now, whence are you?

FOOTMAN 
[Handing her a letter] This letter will make known.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Whence comes it, sir?

FOOTMAN 
From the knight, my master, Sir Gilbert Lambston.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Throwing the letter at him] Return't; I'll receive none on't!

FOOTMAN 
[Aside] There it must lie then; 
I were as good run to Tyburn afoot and hang myself 
At mine own charges as carry it back again.

Exit.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Life, had he not his answer? What strange impudence 
Governs in man when lust is lord of him? 
Thinks he me mad, 'cause I have no moneys on earth, 
That I'll go forfeit my estate in heaven 
And live eternal beggar? He shall pardon me, 
That's my soul's jointure; I'll starve ere I sell that. 
Oh, is he gone, and left the letter here? 
Yet I will read it, more to hate the writer. 
[Reading] "Mistress Low-water, if you desire to understand your own comfort, hear me out ere you refuse me. I'm in the way now to double the yearly means that first I offered you; and to stir you more to me, I'll empty your enemy's bags to maintain you, for the rich widow, the Lady Goldenfleece, to whom I have been a longer suitor than you [an] adversary, hath given me so much encouragement lately, insomuch that I am perfectly assured the next meeting strikes the bargain. The happiness that follows this 'twere idle to inform you of; only consent to my desires, and the widow's notch shall lie open to you. Thus much to your heart; I know y'are wise. Farewell. Thy friend to his power, and another's, Gilbert Lambston." 
In this poor brief, what volumes has he thrust 
Of treacherous perjury and adulterous lust! 
So foul a monster does this wrong appear 
That I give pity to mine enemy here. 
What a most fearful love reigns in some hearts 
That dare oppose all judgment to get means, 
And wed rich widows only to keep queans. 
What a strange path he takes to my affection, 
And thinks 't the near'st way, 'twill never be, 
Goes through mine enemy's ground to come to me. 
This letter is most welcome; I repent now 
That my last anger threw thee at my feet: 
My bosom shall receive thee.

Enter Sir Gilbert Lambston.

SIR GILBERT 
[Aside] 'Tis good policy too, 
To keep one that so mortally hates the widow; 
She'll have more care to keep it close herself. 
And look what wind her revenge goes withal: 
The self-same gale whisks up the sails of love. 
I shall [loose] much good sport by that.-- 
Now, my sweet mistress!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Sir Gilbert, you change [suits] oft; 
You were here in black but lately.

SIR GILBERT 
My mind ne'er shifts though.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Aside] A foul mind the whilst-- 
But sure, sir, this is but a dissembling glass 
You sent before you; 'tis not possible 
Your heart should follow your hand.

SIR GILBERT 
Then may both perish!

MISTRESS [LOW-WATER] 
Do not wish that so soon, sir. Can you make 
A three-months' love to a rich widow's bed, 
And lay her pillow under a quean's head? 
I know you can't, howe'er you may dissemble 't; 
You have a heart brought up better.

SIR GILBERT 
Faith, you wrong me in't; 
You shall not find it so. I do protest to thee, 
I will be lord of all my promises, 
And ere't be long, thou shalt but turn a key 
And find 'em in thy coffer; for my love, 
In matching with the widow, is but policy 
To strengthen my estate and make me able 
To set off all thy kisses with rewards: 
That the worst weather our delights behold, 
It may hail pearl and shower the widow's gold.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
You talk of a brave world, sir.

SIR GILBERT 
'Twill seem better 
When golden happiness breaks forth itself 
Out of the [east port] of the widow's chamber.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
And here it sets.

SIR GILBERT 
Here shall the downfall be; 
Her wealth shall rise from her and set in thee.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
You men have th' art to overcome poor women. 
Pray give my thoughts the freedom of one day, 
And all the rest take you.

SIR GILBERT 
I straight obey. 
[Aside] This bird's my own.

Exit Sir Gilbert Lambston.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
There is no happiness but has her season: 
Herein the brightness of her virtue shines. 
The husk falls off in time that long shuts up 
The fruit in a dark prison; so sweeps by 
The cloud of miseries from wretches' eyes 
That yet, though fall'n, at length they see to rise: 
The secret powers work wondrously and duly.

Enter Master Low-water.

LOW-WATER 
Why, how now, Kate?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Oh, are you come, sir? Husband, 
Wake, wake, and let not patience keep thee poor; 
Rouse up thy spirit from this falling slumber. 
Make thy distress seem but a weeping dream 
And this the opening morning of thy comforts. 
Wipe the salt dew off from thy careful eyes, 
And drink a draught of gladness next thy heart 
T' expel the infection of all poisonous sorrows.

LOW-WATER 
You turn me past my senses.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Will you but second 
The purpose I intend, I'll be first forward. 
I crave no more of thee but a following spirit; 
Will you but grant me that?

LOW-WATER 
Why, what's the business 
That should transport thee thus?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Hope of much good, 
No fear of the least ill: take that to comfort thee.

LOW-WATER 
Yea?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Sleep not on't; this is no slumbering business. 
'Tis like the sweating sickness: I must keep 
Your eyes still wake; y'are gone if once you sleep.

LOW-WATER 
I will not rest then till thou hast thy wishes.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Peruse this love paper as you go.

LOW-WATER 
A letter?

Exeunt.


[I.iii. Sir Oliver's house]
Enter Sir Oliver Twilight, with Master Sandfield, Philip, and Savorwit.

SIR OLIVER 
Good Master Sandfield, for the great affection 
You bear toward my girl, I am well pleas'd 
You should enjoy her beauty. Heaven forbid, sir, 
That I should cast away a proper gentleman 
So far in love with a sour mood or so. 
No, no, 
I'll not die guilty of a lover's neck-cracking. 
Marry, as for portion, there I leave you, sir, 
To the mercy of your destiny again; 
I'll have no hand in that.

SANDFIELD 
Faith, something, sir; 
Be 't but t' express your love.

SIR OLIVER 
I have no desire, sir, 
To express my love that way, and so rest satisfied. 
I pray take heed in urging that too much 
You draw not my love from me.

SANDFIELD 
Fates foresee, sir.

SIR OLIVER 
Faith, then you may go; seek out a high steeple 
Or a deep water: there's no saving of you.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] How naturally he plays upon himself!

SIR OLIVER 
Marry, if a wedding dinner, as I told you, 
And three years' board, well lodg'd in mine house, 
And eating, drinking, and a sleeping portion 
May give you satisfaction, I am your man, sir; 
Seek out no other.

SANDFIELD 
I am content to embrace it, sir, 
Rather than hazard languishment or ruin.

SIR OLIVER 
I love thee for thy wisdom; such a son-in-law 
Will cheer a father's heart. Welcome, sweet Master Sandfield.

[Philip and Savorwit begin to leave with Sandfield.]

Whither away, boys? Philip?

PHILIP 
To visit my love, sir, 
Old Master Sunset's daughter.

SIR OLIVER 
That's my Philip. 
Ply 't hard, my good boys both, put 'em to't finely. 
One day, one dinner and one house shall join you.

PHILIP, SANDFIELD 
That's our desire, sir.

Exeunt.

SIR OLIVER 
Pish! Come hither, Savorwit. 
Observe my son and bring me word, sweet boy, 
Whether h'as a speeding wit or no in wooing.

SAVORWIT 
That will I, sir. [Aside] That your own eyes might tell you. 
I think it speedy: your girl has a round belly.

Exit Savorwit.

SIR OLIVER 
How soon the comfortable shine of joy 
Breaks through a cloud of grief! 
The tears that I let fall for my dead wife 
Are dried up with the beams of my girl's fortunes. 
Her life, her death, and her ten years' distress 
Are ev'n forgot with me; the love and care 
That I ought her, her daughter [sh' owes] it all: 
It can but be bestow'd, and there 'tis well.

Enter Servant.

SIR OLIVER 
How now, what news?

SERVANT 
There's a Dutch merchant, sir, 
That's now come over desires some conference with you.

SIR OLIVER 
How? A Dutch merchant? Pray send him in to me.

[Exit Servant.]

What news with him, trow?

Enter Dutch Merchant with a little Dutch Boy in great slops.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Sir Oliver Twilight?

SIR OLIVER 
That's my name indeed, sir. 
I pray be covered, sir; y'are very welcome.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
This is my business, sir. I took into my charge 
A few words to deliver to yourself 
From a dear friend of yours that wonders strangely 
At your unkind neglect.

SIR OLIVER 
Indeed! What might 
He be, sir?

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Nay, y'are i' th' wrong gender now; 
'Tis that distressed lady, your good wife, sir.

SIR OLIVER 
What say you, sir? My wife?

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Yes, sir, your wife! 
This strangeness now of yours seems more to harden 
Th' uncharitable neglect she tax'd you for.

SIR OLIVER 
Pray give me leave, sir. Is my wife alive?

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Came any news to you, sir, to th' contrary?

SIR OLIVER 
Yes, by my faith, did there.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Pray, how long since, sir?

SIR OLIVER 
'Tis now some ten weeks.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Faith, within this month, sir, 
I saw her talk and eat; and those in our calendar 
Are signs of life and health.

SIR OLIVER 
Mass, so they are in ours.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
And these were the last words her passion threw me: 
"No grief," quoth she, "sits to my heart so close 
As his unkindness and my daughter's loss."

SIR OLIVER 
You make me weep and wonder, for I swear 
I sent her ransom, and that daughter's here.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Here! That will come well to lighten her of one grief. 
I long to see her for the piteous moan 
Her mother made for her.

SIR OLIVER 
That shall you, sir. Within there!

[Enter Servant.]

SERVANT 
Sir?

SIR OLIVER 
Call down my daughter.

SERVANT 
Yes, sir.

[Exit.]

Here's strange budgelling! I tell you, sir, 
Those that I put in trust were near me, too; 
A man would think they should not juggle with me: 
My own son, and my servant, no worse people, sir.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
And yet, ofttimes, sir, what worse knave to a man 
Than he that eats his meat?

SIR OLIVER 
Troth, you say true, sir. 
I sent 'em simply, and that news they brought, 
My wife had left the world; and with that [sum] 
I sent to her, this brought his sister home.

Enter Grace.

Look you, sir, this is she.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
If my eye sin not, sir, 
Or misty error falsify the glass, 
I saw that face at Antwerp in an inn 
When I set forth first to fetch home this boy.

SIR OLIVER 
How? In an inn?

GRACE 
[Aside] Oh, I am betray'd, I fear!

DUTCH MERCHANT 
How do you, young mistress?

GRACE 
Your eyes wrong your tongue, sir, 
And makes you sin in both; I am not she.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
No? Then I never saw face twice. Sir Oliver Twilight, 
I tell you my free thoughts: I fear y'are blinded. 
I do not like this story; I doubt much 
The sister is as false as the dead mother.

SIR OLIVER 
Yea! Say you so, sir? I see nothing lets me, 
But to doubt so too then. 
So, to your chamber; we have done with you.

GRACE 
[Aside] I would be glad you had. Here's a strange storm.-- 
Sift it out well, sir; till anon I leave you, sir.

[Exit.]

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Business commands me hence, but as a pledge 
Of my return, I'll leave my little son with you, 
Who yet takes little pleasure in this country 
'Cause he can speak no English, all Dutch he.

SIR OLIVER 
A fine boy; he's welcome, sir, to me.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Where's your leg and your thanks to the gentleman? 
War es you neighgen an you thonkes you?

DUTCH BOY 
[Bowing] Ick donck you, ver ew edermon vrendly kite.

SIR OLIVER 
What says he, sir?

DUTCH MERCHANT 
He thanks you for your kindness.

SIR OLIVER 
Pretty knave!

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Had not some business held me by the way, 
This news had come to your ear ten days ago.

SIR OLIVER 
It comes too soon now, methinks; I'm your debtor.

DUTCH MERCHANT. 
But I could wish it, sir, for better ware.

Exit.

SIR OLIVER 
We must not be our own choosers in our fortunes. 
Here's a cold pie to breakfast: wife alive, 
The daughter doubtful, and the money spent! 
How am I juggled withal!

Enter Savorwit.

SAVORWIT 
It hits i'faith, sir; 
The work goes even.

SIR OLIVER 
Oh, come, come, come, are you come, sir?

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Life, what's the matter now?

SIR OLIVER 
There's a new reckoning 
Come in since.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Pox on't! I thought all had been paid; 
I can't abide these after-reckonings.

SIR OLIVER 
I pray come near, sir; let's be acquainted with you. 
You're bold enough abroad with my purse, sir.

SAVORWIT 
No more than beseems manners and good use, sir.

SIR OLIVER 
Did not you bring me word some ten weeks since 
My wife was dead?

SAVORWIT 
Yes, true, sir, very true, sir.

SIR OLIVER 
Pray stay! And take my horse along with you, 
And with the ransom that I sent for her 
That you redeem'd my daughter?

SAVORWIT 
Right as can be, sir; 
I never found your worship in a false tale yet.

SIR OLIVER 
I thank you for your good word, sir, but I'm like 
To find your worship now in two at once.

SAVORWIT 
I should be sorry to hear that.

SIR OLIVER 
I believe you, sir. 
Within this month my wife was sure alive-- 
There's six weeks bated of your ten-weeks' lie-- 
As has been credibly reported to me 
By a Dutch merchant, father to that boy, 
But now come over, and the words scarce cold.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Oh, strange!--'Tis a most rank untruth; where is he, sir?

SIR OLIVER 
He will not be long absent.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] All's confounded.-- 
If he were here, I'll tell him to his face, sir; 
He wears a double tongue: that's Dutch and English. 
Will the boy say't?

SIR OLIVER 
'Las, he can speak no English.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] All the better; I'll gabble something to him.-- 
Hoyste kaloiste, kalooskin ee vou, dar sune, alla gaskin?

DUTCH BOY 
Ick wet neat watt hey zackt; ick unverston ewe neat.

SAVORWIT 
Why la, I thought as much.

SIR OLIVER 
What says the boy?

SAVORWIT 
He says his father is troubled with an imperfection at one time of the moon and talks like a madman.

SIR OLIVER 
What? Does the boy say so?

SAVORWIT 
I knew there was somewhat in't. 
Your wife alive! Will you believe all tales, sir?

SIR OLIVER 
Nay, more, sir: he told me he saw this wench 
Which you brought home at Antwerp in an inn, 
Tell[s] me I'm plainly cozen'd of all hands, 
'Tis not my daughter neither.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] All's broke out.-- 
How? Not your daughter, sir? I must to't again. 
Quisquinikin sadlamare, alla pisse kickin sows-clows, hoff tofte le cumber shaw, bouns bus boxsceeno.

DUTCH BOY 
Ick an sawth no int hein clappon de heeke, I dinke ute zein zennon.

SAVORWIT 
Oh, zein zennon! Ah ha! I thought how 'twould prove i' th' end. The boy says they never came near Antwerp: a quite contrary way, round about by Parma.

SIR OLIVER 
What's the same zein zennon?

SAVORWIT 
That is, he saw no such wench in an inn. 'Tis well I came in such happy time to get it out of the boy before his father returned again. Pray be wary, sir; the world's subtle: come and pretend a charitable business in policy, and work out a piece of money on you.

SIR OLIVER 
Mass, art advis'd of that?

SAVORWIT 
The age is cunning, sir; beside, a Dutchman will live upon any ground and work butter out of a thistle.

SIR OLIVER 
Troth, thou say'st true in that: they're the best thrivers in turnips, hartichalks, and cabishes; our English are not like them.

SAVORWIT 
Oh, fie, no, sir!

SIR OLIVER 
Ask him from whence they came, when they came hither.

SAVORWIT 
That I will sir. Culluaron lagooso, lageen, lagan, rufft, punkatee.

DUTCH BOY 
Nimd aweigh de cack.

SAVORWIT 
What, what? I cannot blame him then.

SIR OLIVER 
What says he to thee?

SAVORWIT 
The poor boy blushes for him; he tells me his father came from making merry with certain of his countrymen and he's a little steep'd in English beer. There's no heed to be taken of his tongue now.

SIR OLIVER 
Hoyda! How com'st thou by all this? I heard him speak but three words to thee.

SAVORWIT 
Oh, sir, the Dutch is a very wide language. You shall have ten English words even for one, as for example, Gullder-goose; there's a word for you, master.

SIR OLIVER 
Why, what's that same Gullder-goose?

SAVORWIT 
How do you and all your generation.

SIR OLIVER 
Why, 'tis impossible! How prove you that, sir?

SAVORWIT 
'Tis thus distinguish'd, sir: Gull, how do you, der, and, goose, your generation.

SIR OLIVER 
'Tis a most saucy language; how cam'st thou by't?

SAVORWIT 
I was brought up to London in an eelship; 
There was the place I caught it first by th' [tail]. 
[Aside] I shall be tripp'd anon; pox, would I were gone!-- 
I'll go seek out your son, sir; you shall hear 
What thunder he'll bring with him.

SIR OLIVER 
Do, do, Savorwit; 
I'll have you all face to face.

SAVORWIT 
Cuds me! What else, sir? 
[Aside] And you take me so near the net again, 
I'll give you leave to squat me! I have 'scap'd fairly. 
We are undone in Dutch; all our three-months' roguery 
Is now come over in a butter firkin.

Exit Savorwit.

SIR OLIVER 
Never was man so toss'd between two tales! 
I know not which to take, not which to trust. 
The boy here is the likeliest to tell truth, 
Because the world's corruption is not yet 
At full years in him; sure he cannot know 
What deceit means: 'tis English yet to him. 
And when I think again, why should the father 
Dissemble for no profit? He gets none, 
Whate'er he hopes for, and I think he hopes not. 
The man's in a good case: being old and weary, 
He dares not lean his arm on his son's shoulder 
For fear he lie i' th' dirt, but must be rather 
Beholding to a stranger for his prop.

Enter Dutchman [Dutch Merchant].

DUTCH MERCHANT. 
I make bold once again, sir, for a boy here.

SIR OLIVER 
Oh, sir, y'are welcome. Pray resolve me one thing, sir: 
Did you within this month, with your own eyes, 
See my wife living?

DUTCH MERCHANT 
I ne'er borrowed any. 
Why should you move that question, sir? Dissembling 
Is no part of my living.

SIR OLIVER 
I have reason 
To urge it so far, sir, pray be not angry though, 
Because my man was here since your departure, 
Withstands all stiffly, and to make it clearer, 
Question'd your boy in Dutch, who, as he told me, 
Return'd this answer first to him: that you 
Had imperfection at one time o' th' moon 
Which made you talk so strangely.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
How, how's this? Zeicke yongon, ick ben ick quelt medien dullek heght, ee untoit van the mon, an koot uram'd?

DUTCH BOY 
Wee ek, heigh lieght in ze bokkas, dee't site.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Why, la you, sir! Here's no such thing; 
He says he lies in's throat that says it.

SIR OLIVER 
Then the rogue lies in's throat, for he told me so, 
And that the boy should answer at next question 
That you ne'er saw this wench nor came near Antwerp.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Ten thousand devils! Zeicke hee ewe ek kneeght, yongon, dat wee neeky by Antwarpon ne don cammen no seene de doughter dor?

DUTCH BOY 
Ick hub ham hean sulka dongon he zaut, hei es an skallom an rubbout.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
He says he told him no such matter; he's a knave and a rascal.

SIR OLIVER 
Why, how am I abus'd? Pray tell me one thing: 
What's Gullder-goose in Dutch?

DUTCH MERCHANT 
How? Gullder-goose? 
There's no such thing in Dutch; it may be an ass 
In English.

SIR OLIVER 
Hoyda! Then am I that ass 
In plain English: I am grossly cozen'd, most 
Inconsiderately! Pray let my house receive you 
For one night that I may quit these rascals, 
I beseech you, sir.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
If that may stead you, sir, 
I'll not refuse you.

SIR OLIVER 
A thousand thanks, and welcome. 
On whom can fortune more spit out her foam: 
Work'd on abroad and play'd upon at home!

Exeunt.


II.[i. Weatherwise's house]
Enter Weatherwise, the gull, meeting [Pickadille and] two or three [servants] bringing out a table.

WEATHERWISE 
So, set the table ready. The widow's i' th' next room, looking upon my clock with the days and the months and the change of the moon; I'll fetch her in presently.

[Exit.]

PICKADILLE 
She's not so mad to be fetch'd in with the moon, I warrant you. A man must go roundlier to work with a widow than to woo her with the hand of a dial, or stir up her blood with the striking part of a clock; I should ne'er stand to show her such things in chamber.

Exeunt [Servants]. Enter Weatherwise with the widow [Lady Goldenfleece], Sir Gilbert Lambston, Master Pepperton, Master Overdon.

WEATHERWISE 
Welcome, sweet widow, to a bachelor's house here; a single man I, but for two or three maids that I keep.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Why, are you double with them then?

WEATHERWISE 
An exceeding good mourning wit! Women are wiser than ever they were since they wore doublets. You must think, sweet widow, if a man keep maids, they're under his subjection.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
That's most true, sir.

WEATHERWISE 
They have no reason to have a lock but the master must have a key to't.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
To him, Sir Gilbert. He fights with me at a wrong weapon now.

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside] Nay, and Sir Gilbert strike, my weapon falls; 
I fear no thrust but his. Here are more shooters, 
But they have shot two arrows without heads; 
They cannot stick i' th' butt yet. Hold out, knight, 
And I'll cleave the black pin i' th' midst o' th' white.

Exit.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Nay, and he led me into a closet, sir, where he showed me diet drinks for several months, as scurvigrass for April, clarified whey for June, and the like.

SIR GILBERT 
Oh, madam, he is a most necessary property, an't be but to save our credit, ten pound in a banquet.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Go, y'are a wag, Sir Gilbert.

SIR GILBERT 
How many there be in the world of his fortunes that prick their own calves with briers to make an easy passage for others, or like a toiling usurer sets his son a-horseback in cloth-of-gold breeches while he himself goes t' th' devil afoot in a pair of old strossers. 
But shall I give a more familiar sign? 
His are the sweetmeats, but the kisses mine. [Kisses her.]

OVERDON 
Excellent. [Aside] A pox o' your fortune!

PEPPERTON 
[Taking Overdon aside] Saucy courting has brought all modest wooing clean out of fashion. You shall have few maids nowadays got without rough handling; all the town's so us'd to't, and most commonly too they're join'd before they're married because they'll be sure to be fast enough.

OVERDON 
Sir, since he strives t' oppose himself against us, 
Let's so combine our friendships in our straits 
By all means graceful to assist each other. 
For I protest it shall as much glad me 
To see your happiness and his disgrace, 
As if the wealth were mine, the love, the place.

PEPPERTON 
And with the like faith I reward your friendship. 
I'll break the bawdy ranks of his discourse 
And scatter his libidinous whispers straight.-- 
Madam.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
How cheer you, gentlemen?

SIR GILBERT 
[Aside] Pox on 'em! 
They wak'd me out of a fine sleep; three minutes 
Had fasten'd all the treasure in mine arms.

PEPPERTON 
[Showing her the trenchers] You took no note of this conceit, it seems, madam.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Twelve trenchers, upon every one a month. 
January, February, March, April--

PEPPERTON 
Ay, and their posies under 'em.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Pray, what says May? She's the spring lady.

[PEPPERTON] 
"Now gallant May in her array, 
Doth make the field pleasant and gay."

OVERDON 
"This month of June use clarified whey, 
Boil'd with cold herbs, and drink alway."

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Drink't all away, he should say.

PEPPERTON 
'Twere much better indeed, and wholesomer for his liver.

SIR GILBERT 
September's a good one here, madam.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Oh, have you chose your month? Let's hear't, Sir Gilbert.

SIR GILBERT 
"Now mayst thou physics safely take, 
And bleed, and bathe for thy health's sake. 
Eat figs and grapes and spicery 
For to refresh thy members dry."

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Thus it is still when a man's simple meaning lights among wantons. How many honest words have suffered corruption since Chaucer's days? A virgin would speak those words then that a very midwife would blush to hear now, if she have but so much blood left to make up an ounce of grace. And who is this long on but such wags as you that use your words like your wenches? You cannot let 'em pass honestly by you, but you must still have a flirt at 'em.

PEPPERTON 
You have paid some of us home, madam.

Enter Weatherwise.

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside] If conceit will strike this stroke, have at the widow's plumtree. I'll put 'em down all for a banquet.--Widow and gentlemen, my friends and servants, I make you wait long here for a bachelor's pittance.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Oh, sir, y'are pleas'd to be modest.

WEATHERWISE 
No, by my troth, widow. You shall find it otherwise.

Strike music. Enter banquet and six of his tenants with the twelve signs made like banqueting-stuff: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What, the twelve signs?

WEATHERWISE 
These are the signs of my love, widow.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Worse meat would have serv'd us, sir. By my faith, 
I'm sorry you should be at such charges, sir, 
To feast us a whole month together here.

WEATHERWISE 
Widow, thou'rt welcome a whole month, and ever.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
And what be those, sir, that brought in the banquet?

WEATHERWISE 
Those are my tenants; they stand for fasting days.

SIR GILBERT 
Or the six weeks in Lent.

WEATHERWISE 
Y'are i' th' right, Sir Gilbert. 
Sweet widow, take your place at Aries here; 
That's the head sign. A widow is the head 
Till she be married.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What is she then?

WEATHERWISE 
The middle.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
[Sitting] 'Tis happy she's no worse.

WEATHERWISE 
Taurus, Sir Gilbert Lambston, that's for you. 
They say you're a good town-bull.

SIR GILBERT 
[Sitting] Oh, spare your friends, sir.

WEATHERWISE 
And Gemini for Master Pepperton. 
He had two boys at once by his last wife.

PEPPERTON 
[Sitting] I hear the widow[s] find no fault with that, sir.

WEATHERWISE 
Cancer the Crab for Master Overdon, 
For when a thing's past fifty, it grows crooked.

[Overdon sits.]

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Now for yourself, sir.

WEATHERWISE 
Take no care for me, 
Widow: I can be anywhere. Here's Leo, 
Heart and back; Virgo, guts and belly. 
I can go lower yet, and yet fare better, 
Since Sagittarius fits me the thighs; 
[Sitting] I care not if I be about the thighs, 
I shall find meat enough.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
But under pardon, sir. 
Though you be lord o' th' feast and the conceit both, 
Methinks it had been proper for the banquet 
To have had the signs all fill'd and no one idle.

WEATHERWISE 
I know it had, but whose fault's that, widow? 
You should have got you more suitors to have stopp'd 
The gaps.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Nay, sure, they should get us, and not 
We them. There be your tenants, sir; we are 
Not proud; you may bid them sit down.

WEATHERWISE 
By th' mass, 
It's true too. Then sit down, tenants, 
Once with your hats on, but spare the meat, I charge you, 
As you hope for new leases. I must make 
My signs draw out a month yet, with a bit 
Every morning to breakfast, and at 
Full moon with a whole one; that's restorative. 
Sit round, sit round, and do not speak, sweet tenants. 
You may be bold enough, so you eat but little.

[Tenants sit.]

How like you this now, widow?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
It shows well, sir; 
And like the good old hospitable fashion.

PICKADILLE 
[Aside] How! Like a good old hospital! My mistress makes an arrant gull on him.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
But yet methinks there wants clothes for the feet.

WEATHERWISE 
That part's uncovered yet. Push, no matter for the feet.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Yes, if the feet catch cold, the head will feel it.

WEATHERWISE 
Why then you may draw up your legs, and lie 
Rounder together.

SIR GILBERT 
H'as answered you well, madam.

WEATHERWISE 
And you draw up your legs too, widow, my tenant 
Will feel you there, for he's one of the calves.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Better and better, sir; your wit fattens as he feeds.

PICKADILLE 
[Aside] Sh'as took the calf from his tenant and put it upon his ground now.

[Enter Servant.]

WEATHERWISE 
How now, my lady's man, what's the news, sir?

SERVANT 
Madam, there's a young gentleman below; 
H'as earnest business to your ladyship.

WEATHERWISE 
Another suitor, I hold my life, widow.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What is he, sir?

SERVANT 
He seems a gentleman, 
That's the least of him, and yet more I know not.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Under the leave o' th' master of the house here, 
I would he were admitted.

WEATHERWISE 
With all my heart, widow; I fear him not. 
Come cut and long tail!

SIR GILBERT 
[Aside] I have the least fear 
And the most firmness; nothing can shake me.

[Exit Servant.]

WEATHERWISE 
If he be a gentleman, he's welcome; 
There's a sign does nothing, and that's fit 
For a gentleman. The feet will be kept warm 
Enough now for you, widow, for if he be 
A right gentleman, he has his stockings warm'd 
And he wears socks beside, partly for warmth, 
Partly for cleanliness; and if he observe 
Fridays too, he comes excellent well. 
Pisces will be a fine fish dinner for him.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Why then you mean, sir, he shall sit as he comes?

WEATHERWISE 
Ay, and he were a lord, he shall not sit 
Above my tenants. I'll not have two lords 
To them, so I may go look my rent 
In another man's breeches. I was 
Not brought up to be so unmannerly.

Enter Mistress Low-water as a gallant gentleman, her husband [Low-water] like a serving-man after her.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Aside] I have pick'd out a bold time.--Much good do you, 
Gentlemen.

WEATHERWISE 
Y'are welcome as I may say, sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Pardon my rudeness, madam.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
No such fault, sir; 
You're too severe to yourself; our judgment quits you. 
Please you to do as we do.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Thanks, good madam.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Make room, gentlemen.

WEATHERWISE 
Sit still, tenants. 
I'll call in all your old leases and rack you else.

ALL TENANTS 
Oh, sweet landlord!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Take my cloak, sirrah.

[She gives her cloak to Low-water.]

If any be disturb'd, I'll not sit, gentlemen. 
I see my place.

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside] A proper woman turn'd gallant! 
If the widow refuse me, I care not 
If I be a suitor to him. I have known 
Those who have been as mad, and given half 
Their living for a male companion.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
How, Pisces! Is that mine? [Sitting] 'Tis a conceited banquet.

WEATHERWISE 
If you love any fish, pray fall to, sir. 
If you had come sooner, you might have happened 
Among some of the flesh signs, but now they're all taken up; 
Virgo had been a good dish for you, had not 
One of my tenants been somewhat busy with her.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Pray let him keep her, sir; give me meat fresh: 
I'd rather have whole fish than broken flesh.

SIR GILBERT 
What say you to a bit of Taurus?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
No, I thank you, sir; 
The bull's too rank for me.

SIR GILBERT 
How, sir?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Too rank, sir.

SIR GILBERT 
Fie, I shall strike you dumb like all your fellows.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
What, with your heels or horns?

SIR GILBERT 
Perhaps with both.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
It must be at dead [low water], when I'm dead then.

LOW-WATER 
[Aside] 'Tis brave, Kate, and nobly spoke of thee.

WEATHERWISE 
This quarrel must be drown'd. Pickadille, my lady's fool!

PICKADILLE 
You're your own man, sir.

WEATHERWISE 
Prithee, step in to one o' th' maids.

PICKADILLE 
That I will, sir, and thank you, too.

WEATHERWISE 
Nay, hark you, sir: call for my sun-cup presently; I'd forgot it.

PICKADILLE 
How, your sun-cup? [Aside] Some cup, I warrant, that he stole out o' th' Sun Tavern.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
[Aside] The more I look on him, the more I thirst for't. 
Methinks his beauty does so far transcend, 
Turns the signs back, makes that the upper end.

WEATHERWISE 
How cheer you, widow? Gentlemen, how cheer you? 
Fair weather in all quarters! 
The sun will peep anon; I have sent one for him. 
In the meantime I'll tell you a tale of these. 
This Libra here that keeps the scale so even 
Was i' th' old time an honest chandler's widow 
And had one daughter which was called Virgo, 
Which now my hungry tenant has deflower'd. 
This Virgo, passing for a maid, was sued to 
By Sagittarius there, a gallant shooter, 
And Aries, his head rival; but her old crabbed 
Uncle Cancer here, dwelling in Crooked Lane, 
Still cross'd the marriage, minding to bestow her 
Upon one Scorpio, a rich usurer. 
The girl, loathing that match, fell into folly 
With one Taurus, a gentleman in Townbull Street, 
By whom she had two twins, those Gemini there, 
Of which two brats she was brought abed in Leo 
At the Red Lion about Tower Hill. 
Being in this distress, one Capricorn, 
An honest citizen, pitied her case and married her 
To Aquarius, an old water-bearer, 
And Pisces was her living ever after; 
At Standard she sold fish where he drew water.

ALL 
It shall be yours, sir.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Meat and mirth too! Y'are lavish; 
Your purse and tongue has been at cost today, sir.

SIR GILBERT 
You may challenge all comers at these twelve weapons, I warrant you.

Enter clown [Pickadille with the sun-cup, wearing a veil but no doublet].

PICKADILLE 
Your sun-cup call you it! 'Tis a simple voyage that I have made here. I have left my doublet within for fear I should sweat through my jerkin, and thrown a cypress over my face for fear of sun burning.

WEATHERWISE 
How now, [who's] this? Why, sirrah!

PICKADILLE 
Can you endure it, mistress?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Endure what, fool?

WEATHERWISE 
Fill the cup, coxcomb.

PICKADILLE. 
Nay, an't be no hotter, I'll go put on my doublet again.

Exit.

WEATHERWISE 
What a whoreson sot is this! [Giving the cup to Low-water] Prithee, fill the cup, fellow, and give't the widow.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Sirrah, how stand you? Bestow your service there 
Upon her ladyship.

[He gives the cup to Lady Goldenfleece.]

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What's here? A sun?

WEATHERWISE 
It does betoken, madam, a cheerful day 
To somebody.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
[Aside] It rises full in the face of [yon] 
Fair sign, and yet by course he is the last 
Must feel the heat.--Here, gentlemen, to you all, 
For you know the sun must go through the twelve signs.

[Drinks.]

WEATHERWISE 
Most wittily, widow: you jump with my conceit right; 
There's not a hair between us.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Give it Sir Gilbert.

SIR GILBERT 
I am the next through whom the golden flame 
Shines when 'tis spent in thy celestial ram; 
The poor feet there must wait and cool a while.

[Drinks.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
We have our time, sir; joy and we shall meet: 
I have known the proud neck lie between the feet.

WEATHERWISE 
So round it goes.

[Each drinks in turn.] Enter clown [Pickadille].

PICKADILLE 
I like this drinking world well.

WEATHERWISE 
So fill't him again.

PEPPERTON 
Fill't me? Why, I drunk last, sir.

WEATHERWISE 
I know you did, but Gemini must drink twice, 
Unless you mean that one of them shall be chok'd.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
[Aside] Fly from my heart all variable thoughts! 
She that's entic'd by every pleasing object 
Shall find small pleasure, and as little rest. 
This knave hath lov'd me long; he's best and worthiest, 
I cannot but in honour see him requited.-- 
Sir Gilbert Lambston!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
How! Pardon me, sweet lady, 
That with a bold tongue I strike by your words: 
Sir Gilbert Lambston?

SIR GILBERT 
Yes, sir, that's my name.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
There should be a rank villain of that name; 
Came you out of that house?

SIR GILBERT 
How, sir slave!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Fall to your bull; leave roaring till anon.

WEATHERWISE 
Yet again! And you love me, gentlemen, 
Let's have no roaring here. If I had thought that, 
I'd have sent my bull to the bear garden.

PEPPERTON 
Why, so you should have wanted one of your signs.

WEATHERWISE 
But I may chance want two now, and they fall 
Together by the ears.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What's the strange fire 
That works in these two creatures? Cold signs both, 
Yet more hot than all their fellows.

WEATHERWISE 
Ho, Sol in Pisces! 
The sun's in New Fish Street. Here's an end of this course.

PICKADILLE 
Madam, I am bold to remember your worship for a year's wages and an livery cloak.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
How, will you shame me? Had you not both last week, fool?

PICKADILLE 
Ay, but there's another year past since that.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Would all your wit could make that good, sir.

PICKADILLE 
I am sure the sun has run through all the twelve signs since, and that's a year; [these] gentlemen can witness.

WEATHERWISE 
The fool will live, madam.

PICKADILLE 
[Aside] Ay, as long as your eyes are open, I warrant him.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Sirrah!

LOW-WATER 
Does your worship call?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Giving him a letter] Commend my love and service to the widow; 
Desire her ladyship to taste that morsel.

LOW-WATER 
[Aside] This is the bit I watch'd for all this while, 
But it comes duly.

SIR GILBERT 
And wherein has this name of mine offended, 
That y'are so liberal of your infamous titles, 
I, but a stranger to thee? It must be known, sir, 
Ere we two part.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Marry, and reason, good sir.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Oh, strike me cold! This should be your hand, Sir Gilbert?

SIR GILBERT 
Why, make you question of that, madam? 'Tis one of the letters I sent you.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
[Rising to leave] Much good do you, gentlemen.

ALL 
How now? What's the matter?

WEATHERWISE 
Look to the widow; she paints white! Some aqua coelistis for my lady! Run, villain!

PICKADILLE 
Aqua solister! Can nobody help her case but a lawyer, and so many suitors here?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Oh, treachery unmatch'd, unheard of!

SIR GILBERT 
How do you, madam?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Oh, impudence as foul! Does my disease 
Ask how I do? Can it torment my heart 
And look with a fresh colour in my face?

SIR GILBERT 
What's this? What's this?

WEATHERWISE 
I am sorry for this qualm, widow.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
He that would know a villain when he meets him, 
Let him ne'er go to a conjurer: here's a glass 
Will show him without money, and far truer! 
Preserver of my state, pray tell me, sir, 
That I may pay you all my thanks together, 
What bless'd hap brought that letter to your hand 
From me, so fast lock'd in mine enemy's power?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I will resolve you, madam. I have a kinsman 
Somewhat infected with that wanton pity 
Which men bestow on the distress of women, 
Especially if they be fair and poor; 
With such hot charity, which indeed is lust, 
He sought t' entice, as his repentance told me, 
Her whom you call your enemy, the wife 
To a poor gentleman, one Low-water--

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Right, right, the same.

LOW-WATER 
[Aside] Had it been right, 't 'ad now been.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
And, according to the common rate of sinners, 
Offer'd large maintenance, which with her seem'd nothing: 
For if she would consent, she told him roundly, 
There was a knight had bid more at one minute 
Than all his wealth could compass, and withal 
Pluck'd out that letter as it were in scorn; 
Which, by good fortune, he put up in jest 
With promise that the writ should be returnable 
The next hour of his meeting. But, sweet madam, 
Out of my love and zeal, I did so practice 
The part upon him of an urgent wooer 
That neither he nor that return'd more to her.

SIR GILBERT 
[Aside] Plague o' that kinsman!

WEATHERWISE 
Here's a gallant rascal!

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Sir, you have appear'd so noble in this action, 
So full of worth and goodness, that my thanks 
Will rather shame the bounty of my mind 
Than do it honour. Oh, thou treacherous villain! 
Does thy faith bear such fruit? 
Are these the blossoms of a hundred oaths 
Shot from thy bosom? Was thy love so spiteful 
It could not be content to mock my heart, 
Which is in love a misery too much, 
But must extend so far to the quick ruin 
Of what was painfully got, carefully left me; 
And, 'mongst a world of yielding, needy women, 
Choose no one to make merry with my sorrows 
And spend my wealth on in adulterous surfeits 
But my most mortal enemy? Oh, despiteful! 
Is this thy practice? Follow it, 'twill advance thee! 
Go, beguile on! Have I so happily found 
What many a widow has with sorrow tasted, 
Even when my lip touch'd the contracting cup, 
Even then to see the spider? 'Twas miraculous! 
Crawl with thy poisons hence, and for thy sake 
I'll never covet titles and more riches, 
To fall into a gulf of hate and laughter. 
I'll marry love hereafter; I've enough, 
And wanting that, I have nothing. There's thy way.

OVERDON 
Do you hear, sir? You must walk.

PEPPERTON 
Hear't! Thrust him down stairs!

WEATHERWISE 
Out of my house, you treacherous, lecherous rascal!

SIR GILBERT 
All curses scatter you!

WEATHERWISE 
Life, do you thunder here? If you had stayed a little longer, I'd have ripp'd out some of my bull out of your belly again.

PEPPERTON 
'Twas a most noble discovery; we must love you forever for't.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Sir, for your banquet and your mirth, we thank you; 
You, gentlemen, for your kind company; 
But, you, for all my merry days to come, 
Or this had been the last else.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Love and fortune 
Had more care of your safety, peace, and state, madam.

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside] Now will I thrust in for't.

PEPPERTON 
[Aside] I'm for myself now.

OVERDON 
[Aside] What's fifty years? 'Tis man's best time and season. 
Now the [knight's] gone, the widow will hear reason.

LOW-WATER 
[Aside] Now, now! The suitors flatter; hold on, Kate: 
The hen may pick the meat while the cocks prate.

Exeunt.


[II.ii. A street outside Sir Oliver's house]
Enter Master Sandfield; Philip, Sir Oliver Twilight's son; with Savorwit.

PHILIP 
If thou talk'st longer, I shall turn to marble, 
And death will stop my hearing.

SANDFIELD 
Horrible fortune!

SAVORWIT 
Nay, sir, our building is so far defac'd 
There is no stuff left to raise up a hope.

PHILIP 
Oh, with more patience could my flesh endure 
A score of wounds and all their several searchings 
Than this that thou hast told me!

SAVORWIT 
Would that Flemish ram 
Had ne'er come near our house! There's no going home 
As long as he has a nest there, and his young one, 
A little Flanders' egg new fledg'd; they gape 
For pork, and I shall be made meat for 'em.

PHILIP 
'Tis not the bare news of my mother's life, 
May she live long and happy, that afflicts me 
With half the violence that the latter draws, 
Though in that news I have my share of grief, 
As I had share of sin and a foul neglect: 
It is my love's betraying; that's the sting 
That strikes through flesh and spirit, and sense nor wit 
From thee, in whom I ne'er saw ebb till now, 
Nor comforts from a faithful friend can ease me. 
I'll try the goodness of a third companion, 
What he'll do for me.

[Draws his sword.]

SANDFIELD 
Hold! Why, friend?

SAVORWIT 
Why, master, is this all your kindness, sir? Offer to steal into another country and ne'er take your leave on's? Troth, I take it unkindly at your hands, sir; but I'll put it up for once. [Puts up the sword.] Faith, there was no conscience in this, sir: leave me here to endure all weathers, whilst you make your soul dance like a juggler's egg upon the point of a rapier! By my troth, sir, y'are too blame in't. You might have given us an inkling of your journey; perhaps others would as fain have gone as you.

PHILIP 
Burns this clay lamp of miserable life 
When joy, the oil that feeds it, is dried up?

Enter his mother [Lady Twilight] new landed; with a gentleman, a scholar [Beveril]; and others.

LADY TWILIGHT 
He has remov'd his house.

BEVERIL 
So it seems, madam.

LADY TWILIGHT 
I'll ask that gentleman. Pray, can you tell me, sir, 
Which is Sir Oliver Twilight's?

PHILIP 
Few can better, gentlewoman. 
It is the next fair house your eye can fix on.

LADY TWILIGHT 
I thank you, sir. [To the others, who then leave] Go on. 
He had a son about some ten years since.

PHILIP 
That son still lives.

LADY TWILIGHT 
I pray, how does he, sir?

PHILIP 
Faith, much about my health; that's never worse. 
If you have any business to him, gentlewoman, 
I can cut short your journey to the house. 
I'm all that ever was of the same kind.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Oh, my sweet son! Never fell fresher joy 
Upon the heart of mother! This is he, sir!

BEVERIL 
My seven years' travel has ev'n worn him out 
Of my remembrance.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Oh, this gear's worse and worse!

PHILIP 
[Kneeling] I am so wonderstruck at your bless'd presence 
That through amaz'd joy, I neglect my duty.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Rise, and a thousand blessings spring up with thee.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] I would we had but one in the meantime; 
Let the rest glow at leisure.

LADY TWILIGHT 
But know you not this gentleman yet, son?

PHILIP 
I take it's Master Beveril.

BEVERIL 
My name's Beveril, sir.

PHILIP 
[Embracing him] Right welcome to my bosom!

LADY TWILIGHT 
You'd not think, son, 
How much I am beholding to this gentleman 
As far as freedom; he laid out the ransom, 
Finding me so distress'd.

PHILIP 
'Twas worthily done, sir, 
And I shall ever rest your servant for't.

BEVERIL 
You quite forget your worth. 'Twas my good hap, sir, 
To return home that way after some travels 
Where finding your good mother so distress'd, 
I could not but in pity see her releas'd.

PHILIP 
It was a noble charity, sir; heaven quit you.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] It comes at last.

BEVERIL 
I left a sister here, 
New married when I last took leave of England.

PHILIP 
Oh, Mistress Low-water.

BEVERIL 
Pray, sir, how does she?

PHILIP 
So little comfort I can give you, sir, 
That I would fain excuse myself for silence.

BEVERIL 
Why, what's the worst, sir?

PHILIP 
Wrongs has made her poor.

BEVERIL 
You strike my heart! Alas, good gentlewoman!

PHILIP 
Here's a gentleman; you know him: Master Sandfield.

BEVERIL 
I crave pardon, sir.

PHILIP 
He can resolve you from her kinswoman.

SANDFIELD 
Welcome to England, madam.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Thanks, good sir.

PHILIP 
[Taking Savorwit aside] Now there's no way to 'scape: I'm compass'd round; 
My shame is like a prisoner set with halberds.

SAVORWIT 
Pish, master, master! 'Tis young flood again, 
And you can take your time now; away quick!

PHILIP 
Push, thou'st a swimming head.

SAVORWIT 
Will you but hear me? 
When did you lose your tide when I set forth with you?

PHILIP 
That's true.

SAVORWIT 
Regard me then; though you have no feeling, 
I would not hang by th' thumbs with a good will.

PHILIP 
I hang by th' heart, sir, and would fain have ease.

SAVORWIT 
Then this or none. Fly to your mother's pity, 
For that's the court must help you: y'are quite gone 
At common law; no counselor can hear you. 
Confess your follies and ask pardon for 'em, 
Tell her the state of all things; stand not nicely: 
The meat's too hard to be minc'd now; 
She breeds young bones by this time. 
Deal plainly: heaven will bless thee; turn out all, 
And shake your pockets after it. Beg, weep, 
Kneel, anything; 'twill break no bones, man. 
Let her not rest, take breathing time, nor leave thee 
Till thou hast got her help.

PHILIP 
Lad, I conceive thee.

SAVORWIT 
About it then; it requires haste. Do't well: 
There's but a short street between us and hell.

BEVERIL 
Ah, my poor sister!

LADY TWILIGHT 
'Las, good gentlewoman 
My heart ev'n weeps for her.

[Philip] shogs his mother.

Nay, son, we'll go now.

PHILIP 
May I crave one word, madam?

LADY TWILIGHT 
With me, son? 
The more, the better welcome.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Now, now luck! 
I pray not often: the last prayer I made 
Was nine-year-old last Bartholomew-tide; 'twould have been 
A jolly chopper, and 't 'ad liv'd till this time.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Why do your words start back? Are they afraid 
Of her that ever lov'd them?

PHILIP 
I have a suit to you, madam.

LADY TWILIGHT 
You have told me that already; pray what is't? 
If't be so great my present state refuse it, 
I shall be abler, then command and use it; 
Whate'er 't be, let me have warning to provide for't.

PHILIP 
[Kneeling] Provide forgiveness then, for that's the want 
My conscience feels. Oh, my wild youth has led me 
Into unnatural wrongs against your freedom once. 
I spent the ransom which my father sent 
To set my pleasures free, while you lay captive.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] He does it finely, faith.

LADY TWILIGHT 
And is this all now? 
You use me like a stranger; pray stand up.

PHILIP 
Rather fall flat; I shall deserve yet worse.

LADY TWILIGHT 
[Raising him] Whate'er your faults are, esteem me still a friend, 
Or else you wrong me more in asking pardon 
Than when you did the wrong you ask'd it for, 
And since you have prepar'd me to forgive you, 
Pray let me know for what; the first fault's nothing.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] 'Tis a sweet lady, every inch of her.

PHILIP 
Here comes the wrong then that drives home the rest. 
I saw a face at Antwerp that quite drew me 
From conscience and obedience; in that fray 
I lost my heart, I must needs lose my way: 
There went the ransom, to redeem my mind; 
'Stead of the money, I brought over her, 
And to cast mists before my father's eyes, 
Told him it was my sister, lost so long, 
And that yourself was dead. You see the wrong?

LADY TWILIGHT 
This is but youthful still. Oh, that word "sister" 
Afflicts me when I think on't. I forgive thee 
As freely as thou didst it. For, alas, 
This may be call'd good dealing to some parts, 
That love and youth plays daily among sons.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] She helps our knavery well; that's one good comfort.

PHILIP 
But such is the hard plight my state lives in 
That 'twixt forgiveness I must sin again, 
And seek my help where I bestow'd my wrongs. 
Oh, mother, pity once, though against reason, 
'Cause I can merit none; though my wrongs grieve you, 
Yet let it be your glory to relieve me.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Wherein have I given cause yet of mistrust, 
That you should doubt my succour and my love? 
Show me but in what kind I may bestow 'em.

PHILIP 
There came a Dutchman with report this day 
That you were living.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Came he so lately?

PHILIP 
Yes, madam. 
Which news so struck my father on the sudden 
That he grows jealous of my faith in both. 
These five hours have I kept me from his sight 
And wish'd myself eternally so hid; 
And surely, had not your bless'd presence quicken'd 
The flame of life in me, all had gone out. 
Now to confirm me to his trust again 
And settle much aright in his opinion, 
Say but she is my sister, and all's well.

LADY TWILIGHT 
You ask devotion like a bashful beggar 
That pure need urges and not lazy impudence; 
And to express how glad I am to pity you, 
My bounty shall flow over your demand. 
I will not only with a constant breath 
Approve that, but excuse thee for my death.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Why, here's a woman made as a man would wish to have her.

PHILIP 
Oh, I am plac'd higher in happiness 
Than whence I fell before!

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] We're brave fellows once again, and we can keep our own. Now, hoffte toffte, our pipes play as loftily!

BEVERIL 
My sister fled!

SANDFIELD 
Both fled; that's the news now. Want must obey; 
Oppressions came so thick, they could not stay.

BEVERIL 
Mean are my fortunes, yet had I been nigh, 
Distress nor wrong should have made virtue fly.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Spoke like a brother, worthy such a sister.

BEVERIL 
Grief's like a new wound; heat beguiles the sense, 
For I shall feel this smart more three days hence. 
Come, madam, sorrow's rude and forgets manners.

[Exeunt all except Savorwit].

SAVORWIT 
Our knavery is for all the world like a shifting bankrupt; it breaks in one place, and sets up in another: he tries all trades, from a goldsmith to a tobacco seller, we try all shifts, from an outlaw to a flatterer; he cozens the husband, and compounds with the widow, we cozen my master, and compound with my mistress. Only here I turn o' th' right hand from him: he is known to live like a rascal, when I am thought to live like a gentleman.

[Exit.]


[II.iii. Lady Goldenfleece's house]
Enter Kate [Mistress Low-water] with her man-husband [Low-water, both still disguised].

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I have sent in one to th' widow.

LOW-WATER 
Well said, Kate, 
Thou ply'st thy business close. The coast is clear yet.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Let me but have warning, 
I shall make pretty shift with them.

LOW-WATER 
That thou shalt, wench.

[Enter Lady Goldenfleece's Servant.]

SERVANT 
My lady, sir, commends her kindly to you, 
And for the third part of an hour, sir, 
Desires your patience. 
Two or three of her tenants out of Kent 
Will hold her so long busied.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Thank you, sir. 
'Tis fit I should attend her time and leisure.

[Exit Servant.]

Those were my tenants once, but what relief 
Is there in what hath been or what I was? 
'Tis now that makes the man. A last year's feast 
Yields little comfort for the present humour; 
He starves that feeds his hopes with what is past.

[Enter Low-water.]

How now?

LOW-WATER 
They're come, newly alighted.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Peace, peace! 
I'll have a trick for 'em; look you second me well now.

LOW-WATER 
I warrant thee.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I must seem very imperious, I can tell you; 
Therefore, if I should chance to use you roughly, 
Pray forgive me beforehand.

LOW-WATER 
With all my heart, Kate.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
You must look for no obedience in [these] clothes; 
That lies in the pocket of my gown.

LOW-WATER 
Well, well, I will not then.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I hear 'em coming; step back a little, sir.

Enter Master Weatherwise, Master Pepperton, and Master Overdon, suitors.

Where be those fellows? Who looks out there? Is there ne'er a knave i' th' house to take those gentlemen's horses? Where wait you today? How stand you like a dreaming goose in a corner? The gentlemen's horses, forsooth!

LOW-WATER 
Yes, an't like your worship.

[Exit.]

PEPPERTON 
[Aside to fellow suitors] What's here? A strange alteration!

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside to fellow suitors] A new lord? Would I were upon my mare's back again then.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Pray, gentlemen, pardon the rudeness of these grooms; 
I hope they will be brought to better fashion. 
In the meantime, y'are welcome, gentlemen.

ALL 
We thank you, sir.

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside to fellow suitors] Life, here's quick work! [Taking out his almanac] I'll hold my life h'as struck the widow i' th' right planet. Venus in cauda! I thought 'twas a lecherous planet that goes to't with a caudle.

[Enter Low-water.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
How now, sir?

LOW-WATER 
The gentlemen's horses are set up, sir.

PEPPERTON 
No, no, no, we'll away!

WEATHERWISE 
We'll away.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
How! By my faith, but you shall not yet, by your leave. Where's Bess? Call your mistress, sir, to welcome these kind gentlemen, my friends.

[Exit Low-water.]

PEPPERTON 
[Aside to fellow suitors] How! Bess?

OVERDON 
[Aside to fellow suitors] Peg?

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside to fellow suitors] Plain Bess! I know how the world goes then; he has been abed with Bess, i'faith: there's no trust to these widows; a young horsing gentleman carries 'em away clear.

[Enter Low-water.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Now, where's your mistress, sir; how chance she comes not?

LOW-WATER 
Sir, she requests you to excuse her for a while; she's busy with a milliner about gloves.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Gloves?

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside to fellow suitors] Hoyda! Gloves, too!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Could she find no other time to choose gloves but now when my friends are here?

PEPPERTON 
No, sir, 'tis no matter; we thank you for your good will, sir. To say truth, we have no business with her at all at this time, i'faith, sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Oh, that's another matter; yet, stay, stay, gentlemen, and taste a cup of wine ere you go.

OVERDON 
No, thank you, sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Master Pepperton, Master Weatherwise, will you, sir?

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside to fellow suitors] I'll see the wine in a drunkard's shoes first, and drink't after he has brew'd it! But let her go; she's fitted, i'faith. A proud, surly sir here, he domineers already, one that will shake her bones and go to dice with her money, or I have no skill in a calendar. Life! He that can be so saucy to call her Bess already will call her prating quean a month hence.

Exeunt [suitors].

LOW-WATER 
They have given thee all the slip.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
So, a fair riddance. 
There's three rubs gone; I've a clear way to th' mistress.

LOW-WATER 
You'd need have a clear way because y'are a bad pricker.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Yet if my bowl take bank, I shall go nigh 
To make myself a saver; 
Here's alley room enough: I'll try my fortune. 
I am to begin the world like a younger brother; 
I know that a bold face and a good spirit 
Is all the jointure he can make [a] widow. 
An't shall go hard, but I'll be as rich as he, 
Or at least seem so, and that's wealth enough; 
For nothing kills a widow's heart so much 
As a faint, bashful wooer: though he have thousands 
And come with a poor water-gruel spirit 
And a fish-market face, he shall ne'er speed. 
I would not have himself left a poor widower.

LOW-WATER 
Faith, I'm glad I'm alive to commend thee, Kate. I shall be sure now to see my commendations delivered.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I'll put her to't, i'faith.

LOW-WATER 
But soft ye, Kate. 
How and she should accept of your bold kindness?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
A chief point to be thought on, by my faith. 
Marry, therefore, sir, be you sure to step in, 
For fear I should shame myself and spoil all.

LOW-WATER 
Well, I'll save your credit then for once, 
But look you come there no more.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Away, I hear her coming.

LOW-WATER 
I am vanish d.

Exit. Enter Widow [Lady Goldenfleece].

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
How does my life, my soul, my dear sweet madam?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
I have wrong'd your patience, made you stand too long here.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
There's no such thing, i'faith, madam; y'are pleas'd to say so.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Yes, I confess I was too slow, sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Why, you shall make me amends for that then with a quickness in your bed.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
That were a speedy mends, sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Why, then you are out of my debt; I'll cross the book and turn over a new leaf with you.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
So with paying a small debt, I may chance run into a greater.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
My faith, your credit will be the better then. There's many a brave gallant would be glad of such fortune, and pay use for't.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Some of them have nothing else to do; they would be idle and 'twere not for interest.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I promise you, widow, were I a setter-up, such is my opinion of your payment, I durst trust you with all the ware in my shop.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
I thank you for your good will; I can have no more.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Aside] Not of me, i'faith, nor that neither, and you know all.--Come, make but short service, widow: a kiss and to bed; I'm very hungry, i'faith, wench.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What are you, sir?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Oh, a younger brother has an excellent stomach, madam, worth a hundred of your sons and heirs that stay their wedding stomachs with a hot bit of a common mistress, and then come to a widow's bed like a flash of lightning. Y'are sure of the first of me, not of the five hundredth of them. I never took physic yet in my life; you shall have the doctor continually with them, or some bottle for his deputy: out flies your moneys for restoratives and strength'nings. In me 'tis sav'd in your purse and found in your children: they'll get peevish pothecaries' stuff, you may weigh 'em by th' ounces; I, boys of war, brave commanders, that shall bear a breadth in their shoulders and a weight in their hips, and run over a whole country with a pound o' beef and a biscuit in their belly. Ho, widow, my kisses are virgins, my embraces perfect, my strength solid, my love constant, my heat comfortable; but to come to the point, inutterable--

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
But soft ye, soft ye; because you stand so strictly 
Upon your purity, I'll put you to't, sir. 
Will you swear here you never yet knew woman?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Never, as man e'er knew her, by this light, widow.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What, what, sir? [Aside] 'Shrew my heart, he moves me much.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Nay, since you love to bring a man on's knees, 
I take into the same oath thus much more, 
That y'are the first widow, or maid, or wife 
That ever I in suit of love did court 
Or honestly did woo. How say you to that, widow?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Marry, I say, sir, you had a good portion of chastity left you, though ill fortune run away with the rest.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
That I kept for thee, widow: she's of fortune and all her strait-bodied daughters; thou shalt have't, widow. [Kisses her.]

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Push, what do you mean?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I cannot bestow 't better.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
I'll call my servants.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
By my troth, you shall not, madam.

Enter Master Low-water.

LOW-WATER 
Does your worship call, sir?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Ha, pox! Are you peeping?

Throws somewhat at him. [Exit Low-water.]

[Aside] He came in a good time; I thank him for't.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What do you think of me? You're very forward, sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Extremity of love.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
You say y'are ignorant; 
It should not seem so surely by your play: 
For aught I see, you may make one yourself; 
You need not hold the cards to any gamester.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
That love should teach men ways to wrong itself!

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Are these the first fruits of your boldness, sir? 
If all take after these, you may boast on 'em. 
There comes few such to market among women; 
Time you were taken down, sir. Within there!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Aside] I've lost my way again. 
There's but two paths that lead to widows' beds, 
That's wealth or forwardness, and I've took the wrong one.

Enter [Lady Goldenfleece's] Servant with the suitors [Weatherwise, Pepperton, and Overdon].

SERVANT 
[Aside] He marry my lady? Why, there's no such thought yet.

[Exit.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Aside] Oh, here they are all again too!

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Are you come, gentlemen? I wish no better men.

WEATHERWISE 
Oh, the moon's chang'd now!

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
See you that gentleman yonder?

PEPPERTON 
Yes, sweet madam.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Then pray be witness all of you; with this kiss 
I choose him for my husband--

[Kisses Mistress Low-water.]

ALL SUITORS 
A pox on't!

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
And with this parted gold that two hearts join.

[Breaks a piece of gold and gives half to Mistress Low-water.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Never with chaster love than this of mine.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
And those that have the hearts to come to th' wedding, 
They shall be welcome for their former loves.

Exit.

PEPPERTON 
No, I thank you; y'ave chok'd me already.

WEATHERWISE 
I never suspected mine almanac 'till now. I believe he plays cogging John with me: I bought it at his shop; it may learn the more knavery by that.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Now indeed, gentlemen, I can bid you welcome; 
Before 'twas but a flourish.

WEATHERWISE 
Nay, so my almanac told me there should be an eclipse, but not visible in our horizon, but about the western inhabitants of Mexicana and California.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Well, we have no business there, sir.

WEATHERWISE 
Nor we have none here, sir, and so fare you well.

[Exeunt Suitors.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
You save the house a good labour, gentlemen; the fool carries them away in a voider. Where be these fellows?

Enter [Low-water, Pickadille, and Lady Goldenfleece's] Servant.

SERVANT 
Sir?

PICKADILLE 
Here, sir.

SERVANT 
What['s] your worship['s] pleasure?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Oh, this is something like. [Aside to Low-water] Take you your ease, sir; 
Here are those now more fit to be commanded.

LOW-WATER 
[Aside] How few women are of thy mind! She thinks it too much to keep me in subjection for one day, whereas some wives would be glad to keep their husbands in awe all days of their lives and think it the best bargain that e'er they made.

[Exit.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[To Servant] I'll spare no cost for th' wedding, some device too, 
To show our thankfulness to wit and fortune; 
It shall be so. Run straight for one o' th' wits.

PICKADILLE 
How, one o' th' wits? I care not if I run on that account; are they in town think you? [Starts to leave.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Whither runn'st thou now?

PICKADILLE 
To an ordinary for one of the wits.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Why to an ordinary, above a tavern?

PICKADILLE 
No, I hold your best wits to be at ordinary, nothing so good in a tavern.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
And why I pray, sir?

PICKADILLE 
Because those that go to an ordinary dine better for twelve pence than he that goes to a tavern for his five shillings, and I think those have the best wits that can save four shillings, and fare better too.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
So, sir, all your wit then runs upon victuals.

PICKADILLE 
'Tis a sign 'twill hold out the longer then.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
What were you saying to me?

SERVANT 
Please your worship, 
I heard there came a scholar over lately 
With old Sir Oliver's lady.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Aside] Is she come?-- 
What is that lady?

SERVANT 
A good gentlewoman, 
Has been long prisoner with the enemy.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Aside] I know't too well, and joy in her release.-- 
Go to that house then straight, and in one labour 
You may bid them, and entreat home that scholar.

SERVANT 
It shall be done with speed, sir.

[Exit.]

PICKADILLE 
I'll along with you, 
And see what face that scholar has brought over; 
A thin pair of [parbreaking], sea-water green chops, 
I warrant you.

[Exit.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Since wit has pleasur'd me, 
I'll pleasure wit; scholars shall fare the better. 
Oh, my blessing! I feel a hand of mercy 
Lift me up out of a world of waters, 
And now sets me upon a mountain, where 
The sun plays most, to cheer my heart ev'n as 
It dries my limbs. What deeps I see beneath me, 
In whose falls many a nimble mortal toils 
And scarce can feed himself! The streams of fortune 
'Gainst which he tugs in vain still beat him down, 
And will not suffer him, past hand to mouth, 
To lift his arm to his posterity's blessing. 
I see a careful sweat run in a ring 
About his temples, but all will not do, 
For till some happy means relieve his state, 
There he must stick and bide the wrath of fate. 
I see this wrath upon an uphill land; 
Oh, bless'd are they can see their falls and stand!

Enter [Servant with] Beveril.

How now?

SERVANT 
With much entreating, sir; he's come.

[Exit.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Sir, y'are [aside] my brother! Joys come thick together!--

[Embraces him.] Sir, when I see a scholar, pardon me,

I am so taken with [affection] for him 
That I must run into his arms and clasp him.

BEVERIL 
Art stands in need, sir, of such cherishers; 
I meet too few: 'twere a brave world for scholars 
If half a kingdom were but of your mind, sir; 
Let ignorance and hell confound the rest.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Let it [suffice], sweet sir; you cannot think 
How dearly you are welcome.

BEVERIL 
May I live 
To show you service for't.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Your love, your love, sir: 
We go no higher, nor shall you go lower. 
Sir, I'm bold to send for you, to request 
A kindness from your wit, for some device 
To grace our wedding. It shall be worth your pains, 
And something more t' express my love to art; 
You shall not receive all in bare embracements.

BEVERIL 
Your love I thank; but pray, sir, pardon me, 
I've a heart says I must not grant you that.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
No? What's your reason, sir?

BEVERIL 
I'm not at peace 
With the lady of this house; now you'll excuse me: 
Sh'as wrong'd my sister, and I may not do't.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
The widow knows you not.

BEVERIL 
I never saw her face to my remembrance. 
Oh, that my heart should feel her wrongs so much, 
And yet live ignorant of the injurer!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Let me persuade thee since she knows you not: 
Make clear the weather; let not griefs betray you. 
I'll tell her y'are a worthy friend of mine, 
And so I tell her true, thou art indeed. 
Sir, here she comes.

Enter Widow [Lady Goldenfleece].

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What, are you busy, sir?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Nothing less, lady; here's a gentleman 
Of noble parts, beside his friendship to me. 
Pray, give him liberal welcome.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
He's most welcome.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
The virtues of his mind will deserve largely.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
[Aside] Methinks his outward parts deserve as much then; 
A proper gentleman it is.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Come, worthy sir.

BEVERIL 
I follow.

[Exeunt all but Beveril.]

Check thy blood 
For fear it prove too bold to wrong thy goodness! 
A wise man makes affections but his slaves; 
Break 'em in time, let 'em not master thee! 
Oh, 'tis my sister's enemy, think of that 
Some speedy grief fall down upon the fire 
Before it take my heart; let it not rise 
'Gainst brotherly nature, judgment, and these wrongs! 
Make clear the weather! 
Oh, who could look upon her face in storms! 
Yet pains may work it out: griefs do but strive 
To will this spark; I'll keep it still alive.

[Exit.]


III.[i. A street outside Lady Goldenfleece's house]
Enter the three late suitors, Weatherwise, Pepperton, and Overdon, join'd with Sir Gilbert Lambston.

WEATHERWISE 
Faith, Sir Gilbert, forget and forgive; 
There's all our hands to a new bargain of friendship.

PEPPERTON 
Ay, and all our hearts to boot, Sir Gilbert.

[Sir Gilbert refuses their hands.]

WEATHERWISE 
Why, la, you! There's but four suitors left on's in all th' world, and the fifth has the widow; if we should not be kind to one another, and so few on's, i'faith, I would we were all rak'd up in some hole or other.

SIR GILBERT 
Pardon me, gentlemen, I cannot but remember 
Your late disgraceful words before the widow, 
In time of my oppression.

WEATHERWISE 
Puh, Saturn reign'd then, a melancholy, grumbling planet! He was in the third house of privy enemies, and would have bewray'd all our plots; beside there was a fiery conjunction in the dragon's [tail] that spoil'd all that e'er we went about.

SIR GILBERT 
Dragon or devil, somewhat 'twas I am sure.

WEATHERWISE 
Why, I tell you, Sir Gilbert, we were all out of our wits in't; I was so mad at that time myself, I could have wish'd an hind-quarter of my bull out of your belly again, whereas now I care not if you had eat tail and all. I am no niggard in the way of friendship; I was ever yet at full moon in good fellowship, and so you shall find if you look into the almanac of my true nature.

SIR GILBERT 
Well, all's forgiven for once; hands apace, gentlemen.

WEATHERWISE 
Ye shall have two of mine to do you a kindness; yet when they're both abroad, who shall look to th' house here?

PEPPERTON, OVERDON 
Not only a new friendship, but a friend. 
[They shake hands.]

SIR GILBERT 
But upon this condition, gentlemen, 
You shall hear now a thing worth your revenge.

WEATHERWISE 
And you doubt that, 
You shall have mine beforehand; I've one ready: 
I never go without a black oath about me.

SIR GILBERT 
I know the least touch of a spur in this 
Will now put your desires to a false gallop, 
By all means sland'rous in every place, 
And in all companies, to disgrace the widow, 
No matter in what rank, so it be spiteful 
And worthy your revenges; so now I. 
It shall be all my study, care, and pains, 
And we can lose no labour; all her foes 
Will make such use on't that they'll snatch it from us 
Faster than we can forge it, though we keep 
Four tongues at work upon't and never cease. 
Then for the indifferent world, faith, they're apter 
To bid a [slander] welcome than a truth. 
We have the odds of our side; this in time 
May grow so general as disgrace will spread 
That wild dissension may divide the bed.

WEATHERWISE, PEPPERTON 
Excellent!

OVERDON 
A pure revenge; I see no dregs in't.

SIR GILBERT 
Let each man look to his part now, and not feed 
Upon one dish all four on's, like plain maltmen; 
For at this feast we must have several kickshaws 
And delicate made dishes, that the world 
May see it is a banquet finely furnish'd.

WEATHERWISE 
Why, then let me alone for one of your kickshaws; 
I have thought on that already.

SIR GILBERT 
Prithee, how, sir?

WEATHERWISE 
Marry, sir, I'll give it out abroad that I have lain with the widow myself, as 'tis the fashion of many a gallant to disgrace his new mistress when he cannot have his will of her, and lie with her name in every tavern, though he ne'er came within a yard of her person; so I, being a gentleman, may say as much in that kind as a gallant: I am as free by my father's copy.

SIR GILBERT 
This will do excellent, sir.

WEATHERWISE 
And moreover, I'll give the world thus much to understand beside, that if I had not lain with the widow in the wane of the moon, at one of my seven stars' houses, when Venus was about business of her own and could give no attendance, she had been brought abed with two roaring boys by this time, and the Gemini being infants, I'd have made away with them like a stepmother, and put mine own boys in their places.

SIR GILBERT 
Why, this is beyond talk; you out-run your master.

Enter clown [Pickadille].

PICKADILLE 
[Aside] Whoop! Draw home next time; here are all the old shooters that have lost the game at pricks! What a fair mark had Sir Gilbert on't if he had shot home before the last arrow came in. Methinks these show to me now for all the world like so many lousy beggars turn'd out of my lady's barn, and have ne'er a hole to put their heads in.

WEATHERWISE 
Mass, here's her ladyship's ass; he tells us anything.

SIR GILBERT 
Ho, Pickadille!

PICKADILLE 
What, Sir Gilbert Lambston! 
Gentlemen, outlaws all, how do you do?

SIR GILBERT 
How! What, dost call us? How goes the world at home, lad? 
What strange news?

PICKADILLE 
This is the state of prodigals as right as can be; 
When they have spent all their means on brave feasts, 
[They're] glad to scrape to a serving-man for a meal's meat; 
So you that whilom, like four prodigal rivals, 
Could goose or capon, crane or woodcock choose, 
Now're glad to make up a poor meal with news. 
A lamentable hearing!

WEATHERWISE 
He's in passion, up to the eyebrows for us.

PICKADILLE 
Oh, Master Weatherwise, I blame none but you. 
You are a gentleman deeply read in Pond's Almanac; 
Methinks you should not be such a shallow fellow. 
You knew this day, the twelfth of June, would come 
When the sun enters into the Crab's room, 
And all your hopes would go aside, aside.

WEATHERWISE 
The fool says true, i'faith, gentlemen. I knew 
'Twould come all to this pass; I'll show't you presently.

[Takes out his almanac.]

PICKADILLE 
If you had spar'd but four of your twelve signs now, 
You might have gone to a tavern and made merry with 'em.

WEATHERWISE 
H'as the best moral meaning of an ass that e'er I heard speak with tongue! Look you here, gentlemen. [Reading] "Fifth day, neither fish nor flesh."

PICKADILLE 
No, nor good red herring, and you look again.

WEATHERWISE 
[Reading] "Sixth day, privily prevented."

PICKADILLE 
Marry, faugh!

WEATHERWISE 
[Reading] "Seventh day, shrunk in the wetting."

PICKADILLE 
Nay, so will the best ware bought for love or money.

WEATHERWISE 
[Reading] "The eighth day, over head and ears."

PICKADILLE 
By my faith, he come home in a sweet pickle then.

WEATHERWISE 
[Reading] "The ninth day, scarce sound at heart."

PICKADILLE 
What o' pox ail'd it?

WEATHERWISE 
[Reading] "The tenth day, a courtier's welcome."

PICKADILLE 
That's a cup of beer, and you can get it.

WEATHERWISE 
[Reading] "The eleventh day, stones against the wind."

PICKADILLE 
Pox of an ass! He might have thrown 'em better.

WEATHERWISE 
Now the twelfth day, gentlemen, that was our day. [Reading] "Past all redemption."

PICKADILLE 
Then the devil go with't.

WEATHERWISE 
Now you see plainly, gentlemen, how we're us'd: 
The calendar will not lie for no man's pleasure.

SIR GILBERT 
Push, y'are too confident in almanac posies.

PEPPERTON 
Faith, so said we.

SIR GILBERT 
They're mere delusions.

WEATHERWISE 
How! You see how knavishly they happen, sir.

SIR GILBERT 
Ay, that's because they're foolishly [believ'd], sir.

WEATHERWISE 
Well, take your courses, gentlemen, without 'em, and see what will come on't: you may wander like masterless men; there's ne'er a planet will care a half-penny for you. If they look after you, I'll be hang'd, when you scorn to bestow two pence to look after them.

SIR GILBERT 
How! A device at the wedding say'st thou?

PICKADILLE 
Why, have none of you heard of that yet?

SIR GILBERT 
'Tis the first news, i'faith, lad.

PICKADILLE 
Oh, there's a brave traveling scholar entertain'd into the house o' purpose, one that has been all the world over, and some part of Jerusalem; h'as his chamber, his diet, and three candles allow'd him after supper.

WEATHERWISE 
By my faith, he need not complain for victuals then, whate'er he be.

PICKADILLE 
He lies in one of the best chambers i' th' house, bravely matted; and to warm his wits as much, a cup of sack and an aqua vitae bottle stands just at his elbow.

WEATHERWISE 
He's shrewdly hurt, by my faith, if he catch an ague of that fashion, I'll be hang'd.

PICKADILLE 
He'll come abroad anon.

SIR GILBERT 
Art sure on't?

PICKADILLE 
Why, he ne'er stays a quarter of an hour in the home together.

SIR GILBERT 
No? How can he study then?

PICKADILLE 
Pha, best of all, he talks as he goes, and writes as he runs; besides, you know 'tis death to a traveler to stand long in one place.

SIR GILBERT 
It may hit right, boys! Honest Pickadille, 
Thou wast wont to love me.

PICKADILLE 
I'd good cause, sir, then.

SIR GILBERT 
[Giving him money] Thou shalt have the same still; take that.

PICKADILLE 
Will you believe me now: I ne'er lov'd you better in my life than I do at this present.

SIR GILBERT 
Tell me now truly; who are the presenters? 
What parsons are employed in the device?

PICKADILLE 
Parsons? Not any, sir. My mistress will not be at the charge; she keeps none but an old Welsh vicar.

SIR GILBERT 
Prithee, I mean, who be the speakers?

PICKADILLE 
Troth, I know none, but those that open their mouths. Here he comes now himself; you may ask him.

Enter Master Beveril.

WEATHERWISE 
Is this he? By my faith, one may pick a gentleman out of his calves, and a scholar out on's cheeks; one may see by his looks what's in him. I warrant you there has ne'er a new almanac come out these dozen years but he has studied it over and over.

SIR GILBERT 
Do not reveal us now.

PICKADILLE 
Because you shall be sure on't, you have given me a nine-pence here, and I'll give you the slip for't.

Exit.

SIR GILBERT 
Well said; now the fool's pleas'd, we may be bold.

BEVERIL 
[Aside] Love is as great an enemy to wit 
As ignorance to art; I find my powers 
So much employ'd in business of my heart 
That all the time's too little to dispatch 
Affairs within me. Fortune, too remiss, 
I suffer for thy slowness: had I come 
Before a vow had chain'd their souls together, 
There might have been some hope, though ne'er so little; 
Now there's no spark at all, nor e'er can be, 
But dreadful ones struck from adultery. 
And if my lust were smothered with her will, 
Oh, who could wrong a gentleman so kind, 
A stranger made up with a brother's mind?

SIR GILBERT 
[Aside to the others] Peace, peace, enough, let me alone to manage it.-- 
A quick invention, and a happy one, 
Reward your study, sir.

BEVERIL 
Gentlemen, I thank you.

SIR GILBERT 
We understand your wits are in employment, sir, 
In honour of this wedding.

BEVERIL 
Sir, the gentleman 
To whom that worthy lady is betroth'd 
Vouchsafes t' accept the power of my good will in't.

SIR GILBERT 
I pray resolve us then, sir, 
For we're friends that love and honour her, 
Whether your number be yet full or no, 
Of those which you make choice of for presenters.

BEVERIL 
First, 'tis so brief, because the time is so, 
We shall not trouble many; and for those 
We shall employ, the house will yield in servants.

SIR GILBERT 
Nay, then, under your leave and favour, sir, 
Since all your pains will be so weakly grac'd, 
And wanting due performance lose their lustre, 
Here are four of us gentlemen, her friends, 
Both lovers of her honour and your art, 
That would be glad so to express ourselves, 
And think our service well and worthily plac'd.

BEVERIL 
My thanks do me no grace for this large kindness; 
You make my labours proud of such presenters.

SIR GILBERT 
She shall not think, sir, she's so ill belov'd, 
But friends can quickly make that number perfect.

BEVERIL 
She's bound t' acknowledge it.

SIR GILBERT 
Only thus much, sir, 
Which will amaze her most: I'd have't so carried, 
As you can do't, that neither she nor none 
Should know what friends we were till all were done.

WEATHERWISE 
Ay, that would make the sport.

BEVERIL 
I like it well, sir. 
My hand and faith amongst you gentlemen; 
It shall be so disposed of.

SIR GILBERT 
We are the men then.

BEVERIL 
Then look you, gentlemen: the device is single, 
Naked, and plain because the time's so short, 
And gives no freedom to a wealthier sport; 
'Tis only, gentlemen, the four elements 
In liveliest forms: earth, water, air, and fire.

WEATHERWISE 
Mass, and here's four of us, too!

BEVERIL 
It fits well, sir. 
This the effect: that whereas all those four 
Maintain a natural opposition 
And untruc'd war, the one against the other, 
To shame their ancient envies, they should see 
How well in two breasts all these do agree.

WEATHERWISE 
That's in the bride and bridegroom; I am quick, sir.

SIR GILBERT 
In faith, it's pretty, sir; I approve it well.

BEVERIL 
But see how soon my happiness and your kindness 
Is cross'd together.

SIR GILBERT 
Cross'd? I hope not so, sir.

BEVERIL 
I can employ but two of you.

PEPPERTON 
How comes that, sir?

BEVERIL 
Air and the fire should be by [men] presented, 
But the two other in the forms of women.

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside] Nay, then we're gone again; I think these women 
Were made to vex and trouble us in all shapes!

SIR GILBERT 
Faith, sir, you stand too nicely.

WEATHERWISE 
So think I, sir.

BEVERIL 
Yet when we tax ourselves, it may the better 
Set off our errors, when the fine eyes judge 'em; 
But water certainly should be a woman.

WEATHERWISE 
By my faith, then he is gelded since I saw him last; he was thought to be a man once, when he got his wife with child before he was married.

BEVERIL 
Fie, you are fishing in another stream, sir.

WEATHERWISE 
But now I come to yours and you go to that, sir; I see no reason then but fire and water should change shapes and genders.

BEVERIL 
How prove you that, sir?

WEATHERWISE 
Why, there's no reason but water should be a man, because fire is commonly known to be a quean.

BEVERIL 
So, sir, you argue well.

WEATHERWISE 
Nay, more, sir: water will break in at a little crevice, so will a man if he be not kept out; water will undermine, so will an informer; water will ebb and flow, so will a gentleman; water will search any place, and so will a constable, as lately he did at my seven stars for a young wench that was stole; water will quench fire, and so will Wat the barber; ergo, let water wear a codpiece-point.

BEVERIL 
Faith, gentlemen, I like your company well.

WEATHERWISE 
Let's see who'll dispute with me at the full o' th' moon.

BEVERIL 
No, sir; and you be vainglorious of your talent, I'll put you to't once more.

WEATHERWISE 
I'm for you, sir, as long as the moon keeps in this quarter.

BEVERIL 
Well, how answer you this then? Earth and water are both bearers, therefore they should be women.

WEATHERWISE 
Why, so are porters and peddlers, and yet they are known to be men.


BEVERIL 
I'll give you over in time, sir; I shall repent the bestowing on't else.

WEATHERWISE 
If I that have proceeded in five and twenty such books of astronomy should not be able to put down a scholar now in one thousand six hundred thirty and eight, the dominical letter being G, I stood for a goose.

SIR GILBERT 
Then this will satisfy you though that be a woman; 
Oceanus, the sea, that's chief of waters, 
He wears the form of a man, and so may you.

BEVERIL 
Now I hear reason, and I may consent.

SIR GILBERT 
And so, though earth challenge a feminine face, 
The matter of which earth consists, that's dust, 
The general soul of earth is of both kinds.

BEVERIL 
Fit yourselves, gentlemen, I've enough for me. 
Earth, water, air, and fire, part 'em amongst you.

WEATHERWISE 
Let me play air; I was my father's eldest son.

BEVERIL 
Ay, but this air never possess'd the lands.

WEATHERWISE 
I'm but dispos'd to jest with you, sir; 'tis the same my almanac speaks on, is't not?

BEVERIL 
That 'tis, sir.

WEATHERWISE 
Then leave it to my discretion to fit both the part and the person.

BEVERIL 
You shall have your desire, sir.

SIR GILBERT 
We'll agree 
Without your trouble now, sir. We're not factious 
Or envy one another for best parts, 
Like quarrelling actors that have passionate fits; 
We submit always to the writer's wits.

BEVERIL 
He that commends you may do't liberally, 
For you deserve as much as praise can show.

SIR GILBERT 
We'll send to you privately.

BEVERIL 
I'll dispatch you.

SIR GILBERT 
[Aside] We'll poison your device!

PEPPERTON 
[Aside] She must have pleasures, 
Shows, and conceits, and we disgraceful doom.

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside] We'll make your elements come limping home.

Exeunt [suitors].

BEVERIL 
How happy am I in this unlook'd-for grace, 
This voluntary kindness from these gentlemen!

Enter Mistress Low-water and her man-husband [Low-water; they remain hidden from Beveril].

'Twill set off all my labours far more pleasing 
Before the widow, whom my heart calls mistress, 
But my tongue dares not second it.

LOW-WATER 
How say you now, Kate?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I like this music well, sir.

BEVERIL 
Oh, unfortunate! 
Yet though a tree be guarded from my touch, 
There's none can hinder me to love the fruit.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Nay, now we know your mind, brother, we'll provide for you.

[Exeunt the Low-waters.]

BEVERIL 
Oh, were it but as free as late times knew it, 
I would deserve, if all life's wealth could do it.

Exit.


IV.[i. Sir Oliver's house]
Enter at Sir Oliver's house, himself; old Sunset; his redeemed lady [Lady Twilight]; Master Sandfield; the Dutch Merchant; Philip, Sir Oliver's son; and Savorwit, aloof off; and Servants.

SIR OLIVER 
Oh my reviving joy! Thy quick'ning presence 
Makes the sad night of threescore and ten years 
Sit like a youthful spring upon my blood. 
I cannot make thy welcome rich enough 
With all the wealth of words.

LADY TWILIGHT 
It is express'd, sir, 
With more than can be equall'd; the ill store 
Lies only on my side, my thanks are poor.

SIR OLIVER 
Bless'd be the goodness of his mind forever 
That did redeem thy life; may it return 
Upon his fortunes double! That worthy gentleman, 
Kind Master Beveril, shower upon him, heaven, 
Some unexpected happiness to requite him 
For that my joy unlook'd for! Oh, more kind 
And juster far is a mere stranger's goodness 
Than the sophistic faith of natural sons 
Here's one could juggle with me, take up the ransom, 
He and his loose companion.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Say you me so, sir? 
I'll eat hard eggs for that trick.

SIR OLIVER 
Spend the money, 
And bring me home false news, and empty pockets! 
In that young gallant's tongue there you were dead 
Ten weeks before this day, had not this merchant 
Brought first the truth in words, yourself in substance.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Pray let me stay you here ere you proceed, sir. 
Did he report me dead, say you?

SIR OLIVER 
Else you live not.

LADY TWILIGHT 
See now, sir, you may lay your blame too rashly 
When nobody look'd after it; let me tell you, sir, 
A father's anger should take great advice 
Ere it condemn flesh of so dear a price. 
He's no way guilty yet, for that report 
The general tongue of all the country spread, 
For being remov'd far off, I was thought dead.

PHILIP 
Can my faith now be taken into favour, sir? 
Is't worthy to be trusted?

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] No, by my troth, is't not; 
'Twould make shift to spend another ransom yet.

SIR OLIVER 
Well sir, I must confess y'ave here dealt well with me; 
And what is good in you, I love again.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Now am I half ways in, just to the girdle, 
But the worst part's behind.

SIR OLIVER 
Marry, I fear me, sir, 
This weather is too glorious to hold long.

LADY TWILIGHT 
I see no cloud to interpose it, sir, 
If you place confidence in what I have told you.

SIR OLIVER 
Nay, 'tis clear sky on that side; would 'twere so 
All over his obedience. I see that, 
And so does this good gentleman.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Do you, sir?

SIR OLIVER 
That makes his honesty doubtful.

LADY TWILIGHT 
I pray, speak, sir. 
The truth of your last kindness makes me bold with you.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
The knight, your husband, madam, can best speak; 
He truliest can show griefs whose heart they break.

LADY TWILIGHT 
I'm sorry yet for more; pray let me know't, sir, 
That I may help to chide him, though 'twould grieve me.

SIR OLIVER 
Why, then prepare for't. You came over now 
In the best time to do't you could pick out; 
Not only spent my money, but to blind me, 
He and his wicked instrument--

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Now he fiddles me!

SIR OLIVER 
Brings home a minion here, by great chance known, 
Told me she was his sister; she proves none.

LADY TWILIGHT 
This was unkindly done, sir. Now I'm sorry 
My good opinion lost itself upon you; 
You are not the same son I left behind me; 
More grace took him. Oh, let me end in time 
For fear I should forget myself and chide him! 
Where is [she], sir? Though he beguil'd your eyes, 
He cannot deceive mine; we're now too hard for him. 
For since our first unfortunate separation, 
I've often seen the girl--[aside] would that were true-- 
By many a happy accident, many a one, 
But never durst acknowledge her for mine own, 
And therein stood my joys distress'd again.

SIR OLIVER 
You rehearse miseries, wife. Call the maid down.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] She's been too often down to be now called so; 
She'll lie down shortly and call somebody up.

LADY TWILIGHT 
He's now to deal with one, sir, that knows truth: 
He must be sham'd or quit; there's no mean saves him.

SIR OLIVER 
I hear her come.

LADY TWILIGHT 
[To Philip] You see how hard 'tis now 
To redeem good opinion being once gone; 
Be careful then, and keep it when 'tis won. 
Now see me take a poison with great joy, 
Which but for thy sake, I should swoon to touch.

Enter Grace.

GRACE 
[Aside] What new affliction? Am I set to sale 
For any one that bids most shame for me?

SIR OLIVER 
Look you! Do you see what stuff they've brought me home here?

LADY TWILIGHT 
Oh, bless her, eternal powers! My life, my comforts, 
My nine-years' grief, but everlasting joy now! 
[Embracing Grace] Thrice welcome to my heart; 'tis she indeed.

SIR OLIVER 
What, is it?

PHILIP 
I'm unfit to carry a ransom!

SAVORWIT 
[To Grace] Down on your knees to save your belly harmless; 
Ask blessing, though you never mean to use it, 
But give't away presently to a beggar-wench.

[Grace kneels.]

PHILIP 
My faith is blemish'd; I'm no man of trust, sir.

LADY TWILIGHT 
[Raising her] Rise with a mother's blessing.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] All this while 
Sh'as rise with a son's.

SIR OLIVER 
But soft ye, soft ye, wife: 
I pray take heed you place your blessing right now. 
This honest Dutchman here told me he saw her 
At Antwerp in an inn.

LADY TWILIGHT 
True, she was so, sir.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Sir, 'tis my quality what I speak once 
I affirm ever: in that inn I saw her; 
That lets her not to be your daughter now.

SIR OLIVER 
Oh, sir, is't come to that?

SUNSET 
Here's joys ne'er dream'd on!

SIR OLIVER 
Oh, Master Sunset, I am at the rising 
Of my refulgent happiness! Now, son Sandfield, 
Once more and ever!

SANDFIELD 
I am proud on't, sir.

SIR OLIVER 
Pardon me, boy, I have wrong'd thy faith too much.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Now may I leave my shell and peep my head forth.

SIR OLIVER 
Where is this Savorwit, that honest whoreson, 
That I may take my curse from his knave's shoulders?

SAVORWIT 
Oh, sir, I feel you at my very blade here; 
Your curse is ten stone weight and a pound over.

SIR OLIVER 
Come, thou'rt a witty varlet and a trusty.

SAVORWIT 
You shall still find me a poor, faithful fellow, sir, 
If you have another ransom to send over 
Or daughter to find out.

SIR OLIVER 
I'll do thee right, boy. 
I ne'er yet knew thee but speak honest English; 
Marry, in Dutch I found thee a knave lately.

SAVORWIT 
That was to hold you but in play a little 
Till hither truths came over and I strong. 
You shall ne'er find me a knave in mine own tongue; 
I have more grace in me: I go out of England 
Still when I take such courses; that shows modesty, sir.

SIR OLIVER 
Anything full of wit and void of harm 
I give thee pardon for, so was that now.

SAVORWIT 
Faith, now I'm quit, I find myself the nimbler 
To serve you so again, and my will's good 
[Aside] Like one that lately shook off his old irons, 
And cuts a purse at bench to deserve new ones.

SIR OLIVER 
Since it holds all the way so fortunate still, 
And strikes so even with my first belief, 
This is the gentleman, wife, young Master Sandfield here, 
A man of worthy parts, beside his lands, 
Whom I make choice of for my daughter's bed.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] But he'll make choice there of another bedfellow.

LADY TWILIGHT 
I wish 'em both the happiness of love, sir.

SIR OLIVER 
'Twas spoke like a good lady! And your memory 
Can reach it, wife, but 'tis so long ago too, 
Old Master Sunset he had a young daughter 
When you unluckily left England so, 
And much about the age of our girl there, 
For both were nurs'd together.

LADY TWILIGHT 
'Tis so fresh 
In my remembrance now y'have waken'd it, 
As if twelve years were but a twelve-hours' dream.

SIR OLIVER 
That girl is now a proper gentlewoman, 
As fine a body, wife, as e'er was measured 
With an indenture cut in farthing steaks.

SUNSET 
Oh, say not so, Sir Oliver; you shall pardon me, sir. 
I'faith, sir, you are too blame.

SIR OLIVER 
Sings, dances, plays, 
Touches an instrument with a motherly grace.

SUNSET 
'Tis your own daughter that you mean that by.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] There's open Dutch indeed, and he could take it!

SIR OLIVER 
This wench, under your leave--

SUNSET 
You have my love in't.

SIR OLIVER 
Is my son's wife that shall be.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Thus I'd hold with't; 
Is your son's wife that should be Master Sandfield's.

LADY TWILIGHT 
I come in happy time to a feast of marriages.

SIR OLIVER 
And now you put's i' th' mind, the hour draws on 
At the new-married widow's; there we're look'd for. 
There will be entertainments, sports, and banquets; 
There these young lovers shall clap hands together: 
The seed of one feast shall bring forth another.

SUNSET 
Well said, Sir Oliver.

SIR OLIVER 
Y'are a stranger, sir, 
Your welcome will be best.

DUTCH MERCHANT 
Good sir, excuse me.

SIR OLIVER 
You shall along, i'faith; you must not refuse me.

[Exeunt.] Manent Mother [Lady Twilight], Sister [Grace], Philip, and Savorwit.

PHILIP 
Oh, mother, these new joys that sets my soul up, 
Which had no means nor any hope of any, 
Has brought me now so far in debt to you, 
I know not which way to begin to thank you. 
I am so lost in all, I cannot guess 
Which of the two my service most constrains, 
Your last kind goodness or your first dear pains.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Love is a mother's duty to a son, 
As a son's duty is both love and fear.

SAVORWIT 
I owe you a poor life, madam, that's all: 
Pray call for't when you please; it shall be ready for you.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Make much on't, sir, till then.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] If butter'd sack will.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Methinks the more I look upon her, son, 
The more thy sister's face runs in my mind.

PHILIP 
Belike she's somewhat like her; it makes the better, madam.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Was Antwerp, say you, the first place you found her in?

PHILIP 
Yes, madam. Why do you ask?

LADY TWILIGHT 
Whose daughter were you?

GRACE 
I know not rightly whose, to speak truth, madam.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] The mother of her was a good twigger the whilst.

LADY TWILIGHT 
No? With whom were you brought up then?

GRACE 
With those, madam, 
To whom, I've often heard, the enemy sold me.

LADY TWILIGHT 
What's that? 
Too often have I heard this piteous story 
Of a distressed mother I had once, 
Whose comfortable sight I lost at sea; 
But then the years of childhood took from me 
Both the remembrance of her and the sorrows.

LADY TWILIGHT 
[Aside] Oh, I begin to feel her in my blood! 
My heart leaps to be at her. What was that mother?

GRACE 
Some said an English lady, but I know not.

LADY TWILIGHT 
What's thy name?

GRACE 
Grace.

LADY TWILIGHT 
May it be so in heaven, 
For thou art mine on earth. [Embracing her] Welcome, dear child, 
Unto thy father's house, thy mother's arms, 
After thy foreign sorrows.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] 'Twill prove gallant.

LADY TWILIGHT 
What, son! Such earnest work; I bring thee joy now 
Will make the rest show nothing, 'tis so glorious.

PHILIP 
Why, 'tis not possible, madam, that man's happiness 
Should take a greater height than mine aspires.

LADY TWILIGHT 
No, now you shall confess it; this shall quit thee 
From all fears present or hereafter doubts 
About this business.

PHILIP 
Give me that, sweet mother.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Here, take her then, and set thine arms a-work; 
There needs no 'fection, 'tis indeed thy sister.

PHILIP 
My sister!

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Cuds me, I feel the razor!

LADY TWILIGHT 
Why, how now, son? How comes a change so soon?

PHILIP 
Oh, I beseech you, mother, wound me anywhere 
But where you pointed last. That's present death! 
Devise some other miserable torment, 
Though ne'er so pitiless, and I'll run and meet it. 
Some way more merciful let your goodness think on 
May steal away my joys, but save my soul! 
I'll willingly restore back every one 
Upon that mild condition; anything 
But what you spake last will be comfortable.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Y'are troubled with strange fits in England here. 
Your first suit to me did entreat me hardly 
To say 'twas she, to have old wrath appeas'd, 
And now 'tis known your sister, y'are not pleas'd. 
How should I show myself?

PHILIP 
Say 'tis not she.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Shall I deny my daughter?

PHILIP 
Oh, you kill me 
Beyond all tortures!

LADY TWILIGHT 
Why do you deal thus with me?

PHILIP 
She is my wife! I married her at Antwerp; 
I have known the way unto her bed these three months.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] And that's too much by twelve weeks for a sister.

LADY TWILIGHT 
I understand you now, too soon, too plain.

PHILIP 
Oh, mother, if you love my peace forever, 
Examine her again, find me not guilty.

LADY TWILIGHT 
'Tis now too late, her words make that too true.

PHILIP 
Her words? Shall bare words overthrow a soul? 
A body is not cast away so lightly. 
How can you know 'tis she? Let sense decide it; 
She then so young, and both so long divided.

LADY TWILIGHT 
She tells me the sad story.

PHILIP 
Does that throw me? 
Many a distress may have the face of yours 
That never was kin to you.

LADY TWILIGHT 
But, however, sir, 
I trust you are not married.

PHILIP 
Here's the witness, 
And all the wealth I had with her; this ring 
That join'd our hearts together.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Oh, too clear now! 
Thou'st brought in evidence to o'erthrow thyself; 
Had no one word been spoke, only this shown, 
'T had been enough to approv'd her for mine own. 
See here, two letters that begun my name 
Before I knew thy father; this I gave her, 
And, as a jewel, fasten'd to her ear.

GRACE 
Pardon me, mother, that you find it stray; 
I kept it till I gave my heart away.

PHILIP 
Oh, to what mountain shall I take my flight 
To hide the monster of my sin from sight?

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] I'll to Wales presently; there's the best hills 
To hide a poor knave in.

LADY TWILIGHT 
Oh, heap not desperation upon guilt! 
Repent yet and all's sav'd; 'twas but hard chance: 
Amongst all sins, heaven pities ignorance. 
She's still the first that has her pardon sign'd; 
All sins else see their faults, she's only blind. 
Go to thy chamber, pray, leave off, and win; 
One hour's repentance cures a twelve-month's sin.

GRACE 
Oh, my distressed husband, my dear brother! 
[Lady Twilight] exit cum filia [Grace].

PHILIP 
Oh, Savorwit! Never came sorrow yet 
To mankind like it; I'm so far distress'd, 
I've no time left to give my heart attendance, 
Too little all to wait upon my soul! 
Before this tempest came, how well I stood, 
Full in the beams of blessedness and joy! 
The memory of man could never say 
So black a storm fell in so bright a day. 
I am that man that ev'n life surfeits of; 
Or if to live, unworthy to be seen 
By the savage eyesight! Give's thy hand; 
Commend me to thy prayers.

SAVORWIT 
Next time I say 'em.

PHILIP 
Farewell, my honest breast, that cravest no more 
Than possible kindness; that I've found thee large in, 
And I must ask no more: there wit must stay; 
It cannot pass where fate stops up the way. 
Joy thrive with thee; I'll never see thee more.

SAVORWIT 
What's that, sir? 
Pray come back, and bring those words with you; 
You shall not carry 'em so out of my company. 
There's no last refuge when your father knows it; 
There's no such need on't yet: stay but till then, 
And take one with you that will imitate you 
In all the desperate onsets man dare think on. 
Were it to challenge all the wolves in France 
To meet at one set battle, I'd be your half in't; 
All beasts of venom, what you had a mind to, 
Your part should be took still. For such a day 
Let's keep ourselves in heart, then am I for you. 
In the meantime, to beat off all suspicion, 
Let's to the bridehouse too; here's my petition.

PHILIP 
Thou hast a learning art when all hopes fly. 
Let one night waste; there's time enough left to die.

SAVORWIT 
A minute's as good as a thousand year, sir, 
To pink a man's heart like a summer suit.

Exeunt.


[IV.ii. Lady Goldenfleece's house]
Enter two or three Servants placing things in order, with Pickadille, the clown, like an overseer.

PICKADILLE 
Bestir your bones nimbly, you ponderous, beef-buttock'd knaves; what a number of lazy hinds do I keep company withal! Where's the flesh-colour, velvet cushion now for my lady's pease-porridge-tawny-satin bum? You attendants upon revels!

FIRST SERVANT 
You can prate and domineer well because you have a privilege[d] place, but I'd fain see you set your hand to't!

PICKADILLE 
Oh, base bone-pickers, I set my hand to't! When did you e'er see a gentleman set his hand to anything unless it were to a sheepskin and receive a hundred pound for his pains?

SECOND SERVANT 
And afterward lie in the Counter for his pleasure.

PICKADILLE 
Why, true, sir; 'tis for his pleasure indeed, for, spite of all their teeths, he may lie i' th' hole when he list.

FIRST SERVANT 
Marry, and should for me.

PICKADILLE 
Ay, thou wouldst make as good a bawd as the best jailor of them all; I know that.

FIRST SERVANT 
How, fool!

PICKADILLE 
Hark! I must call you knave within; 'tis but staying somewhat the longer for't.

Exeunt. Loud music. Enter the new-married widow [Lady Goldenfleece], and Kate [Mistress Low-water], her husband, both changed in apparel, [but Mistress Low-water still disguised,] arm in arm together; after them Sir Oliver Twilight, Master Sunset, and the Dutch Merchant; after them the mother [Lady Twilight]; Grace, the daughter sad; with Jane Sunset; after these, melancholy Philip, Savorwit, and Master Sandfield [and Low-water, still disguised].

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
This fair assembly is most freely welcome.

ALL 
Thanks to you, good sir.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
[To Lady Twilight] Come, my long-wish'd-for madam, 
You and this worthy stranger take best welcome; 
Your freedom is a second feast to me.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Taking Low-water aside] How is't with my brother?

LOW-WATER 
The fit holds him still; 
Nay, love's more violent.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
'Las, poor gentleman! 
I would he had my office without money; 
If he should offer any, I'd refuse it

LOW-WATER 
I have the letter ready; he's worthy 
Of a place that knows how to use it.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
That's well said.-- 
Come ladies, gentlemen; Sir Oliver, good: 
Seat yourselves; shall we be found unreadiest? 
What is yon gentleman with the funeral face there? 
Methinks that look does ill become a bride-house.

SIR OLIVER 
Who does your worship mean, sir? My son Philip? 
I am sure he had ne'er less reason to be sad. 
Why are you sad, son Philip?

PHILIP 
How, sir, sad? 
You shall not find it so, sir.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside to Philip] Take heed he do not then. 
You must beware how you carry your face in this company; as far as I can see, that young bridegroom has hawk's eyes: he'll go nigh to spell sister in your face; if your nose were but crooked enough to serve for an S, he'd find an eye presently, and then he has more light for the rest.

PHILIP 
I'll learn then to dissemble.

SAVORWIT 
Nay, and you be to learn that now, you'll ne'er sit in a branch'd-velvet gown as long as you live! You should have took that at nurse before your mother wean'd you; so do all those that prove great children and batten well.

Enter Master Beveril with a pasteboard.

Peace, here comes a scholar indeed; he has learn'd it, I warrant you.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Kind sir, you're welcome; you take all the pains, sir.

BEVERIL 
I wish they were but worthy of the grace 
Of your fair presence and this choice assembly. 
Here is an abstract, madam, of what's shown, 
Which I commend to your favour.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Thank you for't, sir.

BEVERIL 
[Aside] I would I durst present my love as boldly.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Aside] My honest brother!

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Look thee here, sweetheart.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
What's there, sweet madam?

BEVERIL 
Music, and we're ready.

Loud music a while. A thing like a globe opens of one side o' th' stage and flashes out Fire, then Sir Gilbert, that presents the part, issues forth with yellow hair and beard intermingled with [streaks] like wild flames, a three-fork'd fire in's hand; and, at the same time, Air [Weatherwise] comes down hanging by a cloud, with a coat made like an almanac, all the twelve moons set in it, and the four quarters--winter, spring, summer, and autumn--with change of weathers--rain, lightning, and tempest, etc. And from under the stage at both ends arises Water [Overdon] and Earth [Pepperton], two persons: Water with green flags upon his head standing up instead of hair, and a beard of the same, with a chain of pearl; Earth with a number of little things like trees, like a thick grove, upon his head, and a wedge of gold in his hand, his garment of a clay colour. The Fire speaking first, the scholar [Beveril] stands behind, gives him the first word, which he now follows.

BEVERIL 
[Whispering his cue] The flame of zeal--

SIR GILBERT [as Fire] 
The wicked fire of lust, 
Does now spread heat through water, air, and dust.

BEVERIL 
[Aside] How! He's out in the beginning! [To Sir Gilbert] The wheel of time--

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside] The devil set fire o' th' distaff.

SIR GILBERT 
I that was wont in elder times to pass 
For a bright angel, so they call'd me then, 
Now so corrupted with the upstart fires 
Of avarice, luxury, and inconstant heats, 
Struck from the bloods of cunning, clap-fall'n daughters, 
Night-walking wives, but, most, libidinous widows, 
That I, that purify ev'n gold itself, 
Have the contemptible dross thrown in my face, 
And my bright name walk common in disgrace. 
How am I us'd o' late that I am so handled, 
Thrust into alleys, hospitals, and tubs! 
I was once a name of comfort, warm'd great houses 
When charity was landlord; I have given welcome 
To forty russet yeomen at a time 
In a fair Christmas-hall. How am I chang'd! 
The chimneys are swept up, the hearth as cold 
As the forefathers' charity in the [son]. 
All the good hospitable heat now turns 
To my young landlord's lust, and there it burns. 
Rich widows, that were wont to choose by gravity 
Their second husbands, not by tricks of blood, 
Are now so taken with loose Aretine flames 
Of nimble wantonness and high-fed pride 
They marry now but the third part of husbands, 
Boys, smooth-fac'd catamites, to fulfill their bed, 
As if a woman should a woman wed. 
These are the fires o' late: my brightness darks 
And fills the world so full of beggarly sparks.

BEVERIL 
[Aside] [Heart]! How am I disgrac'd! What rogue should this be?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
By my faith, Monsieur Fire, y'are a hot whoreson!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Aside] I fear my brother is beside his wits; 
He would not be so senseless to rail thus else.

WEATHERWISE as Air 
After this heat, you madams fat and fair, 
Open your casements wide and take in air; 
But not that air false women make up oaths with, 
No, nor that air gallants perfume their clothes with: 
I am that air that keeps about the clouds. 
None of my kindred was smelt out in crowds; 
Not any of our house was ever tainted 
When many a thousand of our foes have fainted. 
Yet some there are that be my chief polluters, 
Widows that falsify their faith to suitors 
And will give fair words when the sign's in Cancer, 
But, at the next remove, a scurvy answer; 
Come to the poor men's houses, eat their banquet, 
And at night with a boy toss'd in a blanket. 
Nay, shall I come more near? Perhaps at noon, 
For here I find a spot full in the moon. 
I know youth's trick; what's she that can withstand it 
When Mercury reigns, my lady's chamber planet? 
He that believes a widow's words shall fail 
When Venus' gown-skirts sweeps the Dragon's tail. 
Fair weather the first day she makes to any, 
The second cloudy, and the third day rainy; 
The fourth day a great storm, lightning and thunder: 
A bolt strikes the suitor, a boy keeps her under.

BEVERIL 
[Aside] Life! These are some counterfeit slaves crept in their rooms, 
A' purpose for disgrace; they shall all share with me. 
Heart! Who the devil should these be?

Exit Beveril.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
My faith, gentlemen, 
Air has perfum'd the room well!

SIR OLIVER 
So methinks, madam.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] A man may smell her meaning two rooms off, 
Though his nose wanted reparations 
And the bridge left at Shoreditch as a pledge 
For rosa solis, in a bleaking-house.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Life! What should be his meaning in't?

LOW-WATER 
I wonder.

OVERDON as Water 
Methinks this room should yet retain such heat 
Struck out from the first ardour and so glow yet, 
You should desire my company, wish for water, 
That offers here to serve your several pipes 
Without constraint of mill or death of water house. 
What if I sprinkled on the widow's cheeks 
A few cool drops to lay the guilty heat 
That flashes from her conscience to her face; 
Would't not refresh her shame? From such as she 
I first took weakness and inconstancy; 
I sometimes swell above my banks and spread. 
They're commonly with child before they're wed; 
In me the sirens sing before they play, 
In her more witchcraft, for her smiles betray. 
Where I'm least seen, there my most danger lies, 
So in those parts hid most from a man's eyes: 
Her heart, her love, or what may be more close. 
I know no mercy, she thinks that no loss. 
In her, poor gallants! Pirates thrive in me; 
I help to cast away, and so does she.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Nay, and you can hold nothing, sweet sir Water, 
I'll wash my hands a' you ever hereafter.

PEPPERTON as Earth 
Earth stands for a full point: me you should hire 
To stop the gaps of water, air, and fire. 
I love muck well, but your first husband better: 
Above his soul he lov'd it, as his end 
Did fearfully witness it; at his last gasp 
His spirit flam'd, as it forsook his breast, 
And left the sparkles quarreling 'bout his lips. 
Now of such metal the devil makes him whips; 
He shall have gold enough to glut his soul: 
And as for earth, I'll stop his crane's throat full. 
The wealth he left behind him, most men know, 
He wrung inconscionably from the rights 
Of poor men's livings; he drunk dry their brows. 
That liquor has a curse, yet nothing sweeter; 
When your posterity drinks, then 'twill taste bitter.

SIR GILBERT 
And now to vex, 'gainst nature, form, rule, place, 
See once four [warring] elements all embrace.

[They embrace.] Enter four [including Beveril] at several corners, address'd like the four winds, with wings, etc., and dance all to the drum and fife. The four Elements seem to give back and stand in amaze. The South Wind has a great red face, the North Wind a pale bleach one, the Western Wind one cheek red and another white, and so the Eastern Wind. At the end of the dance, the Winds shove off the disguises of the other four [the Elements], which seem to yield and almost fall of themselves at the coming of the Winds; so all the four old suitors are discovered. Exeunt all the Winds but one, which is the scholar [Beveril] in that disguise; so shows all.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
How! Sir Gilbert Lambston, Master Overdon! 
All our old suitors! You have took pains, my masters.

SIR GILBERT 
We made a vow we'd speak our minds to you.

WEATHERWISE 
And I think we're as good as our words, though it cost some of our purses: I owe money for the clouds yet, I care not who knows it; the planets are sufficient enough to pay the painter, and I were dead.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Who are you, sir? 
BEVERIL 
[Removing his disguise] Your most unworthy servant.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Pardon me, is't you, sir?

BEVERIL 
My disgrace urg'd my wit to take some form 
Wherein I might both best and properliest 
Discover my abusers and your own, 
And show you some content before y' had none.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Sir, I owe much both to your care and love, 
And you shall find your full requital worthy. 
[To suitors] Was this the plot now your poor envy works out? 
I do revenge myself with pitying on you. 
[To Low-water] Take Fire into the buttery, he has most need on't; 
Give Water some small beer, too good for him; 
Air, you may walk abroad like a fortune-teller; 
But take down Earth and make him drink i' th' cellar.

[Exeunt Low-water with suitors.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
The best revenge that could be.

LADY TWILIGHT 
I commend you, madam.

SIR OLIVER 
I thought they were some such sneakers.

SAVORWIT 
The four suitors! And here was a mess of mad elements!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Lights, more lights there! Where be these blue-coats?

[Enter servants with lights.]

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
You know your lodgings, gentlemen, tonight.

SIR OLIVER 
'Tis bounty makes bold guests, madam.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
[To Lady Twilight] Good rest, lady.

SIR OLIVER 
A most contentful night begin a health, madam, 
To your long joys, and may the years go round with't.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
As many thanks as you have wish'd 'em hours, sir, 
Take to your lodging with you.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
A general rest to all.

Exeunt [all the guests save Philip and Savorwit].

PHILIP 
[Aside to Savorwit] I'm excepted.

SAVORWIT 
[Aside to Philip] Take in another to you then; there's room enough 
In that exception, faith, to serve us both. 
The dial of my sleep goes by your eyes.

[Exeunt.] Manent Widow [Lady Goldenfleece] and Mistress Low-water.


V.[i. Lady Goldenfleece's house]
LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Now, like a greedy usurer alone, 
I sum up all the wealth this day has brought me, 
And thus I hug it.

[Embraces her.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Prithee!

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Thus, I kiss it. [Kisses her.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I can't abide these kissings.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
How, sir? Not? 
I'll try that sure; I'll kiss you out of that humour.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Push, by my troth, I cannot.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What cannot you, sir?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Not toy, nor bill and imitate house pigeons; 
A married man must think of other matters.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
How, other matters, sir? What other matters?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Why, are there no other matters that belong to't? 
Do you think y'have married only a cock-sparrow 
And fit but for one business like a fool? 
You shall not find it so.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
You can talk strangely, sir. 
Come, will you to bed?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
No, faith, will not I.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What, not to bed, sir?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
And I do, hang me! Not to bed with you!

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
How, not to bed with me! Sir, with whom else?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Why, am not I enough to lie with myself?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Is that the end of marriage? 
MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
No, by my faith, 
'Tis but the beginning, yet death is the end on't, 
Unless some trick come i' th' middle and dash all.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Were you so forward lately and so youthful 
That scarce my modest strength could save me from you, 
And are you now so cold?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I've thought on't since. 
It was but a rude part in me, i'faith, 
To offer such bold tricks to any woman, 
And by degrees I shall well break myself from't; 
I feel myself well chasten'd since that time, 
And not the third part now so loosely minded. 
Oh, when one sees their follies, 'tis a comfort! 
My very thoughts take more staid years upon 'em. 
Oh, marriage is such a serious divine thing! 
It makes youth grave and sweetly nips the spring.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
If I had chose a gentleman for care 
And worldly business, I had ne'er took you; 
I had the offers of enough more fit 
For such employment: I chose you for love, 
Youth, and content of heart, and not for troubles; 
You are not ripe for them. After y'have spent 
Some twenty years in dalliance, youth's affairs, 
Then take a book in your hand and sum up cares; 
As for wealth now, you know that's got to your hands.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
But had I known 't had been so wrongfully got, 
As I heard since, you should have had free leave 
To have made choice of another master for't.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Why, can that trouble you?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
It may too soon. But go; 
My sleeps are sound: I love not to be started 
With an ill conscience at the fall of midnight, 
And have mine eyes torn ope with poor men's curses. 
I do not like the fate on't: 'tis still apt 
To breed unrest, dissension, wild debate, 
And I'm the worst at quarrels upon earth, 
Unless a mighty injury should provoke me. 
Get you to bed, go.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Not without you, in troth, sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
If you could think how much you wrong yourself 
In my opinion of you, you would leave me now 
With all the speed you might; I like you worse 
For this fond heat, and drink in more suspicion of you. 
You high-fed widows are too cuing people 
For a poor gentleman to come simply to.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What's that, sir?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
You may make a youth on him; 
'Tis at your courtesy, and that's ill trusted. 
You could not want a friend beside a suitor 
To sit in your husband's gown and look over your writings.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What's this?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I say there is a time when women 
Can do too much and understand too little. 
Once more, to bed; I'd willingly be a father 
To no more noses than I got myself, 
And so good night to you.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
[Aside] Now I see the infection. 
A yellow poison runs through the sweet spring 
Of his fair youth already; 'tis distracted, 
Jealous of that which thought yet never acted.-- 
[Kneeling] Oh, dear sir! On my knees, I swear to thee--

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I prithee use them in thy private chamber 
As a good lady should; spare 'em not there, 
'Twill do thee good. Faith, none 'twill do thee here.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
[Rising, aside] Have I yet married poverty and [miss'd] love? 
What fortune has my heart? That's all I crav'd, 
And that lies now a-dying; it has took 
A speeding poison, and I'm ignorant how: 
I never knew what beggary was till now. 
My wealth yields me no comfort in this plight; 
Had want but brought me love, I'd happen'd right.

Exit Widow [Lady Goldenfleece].

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
So, this will serve now for a preparative 
To ope the [pores] of some dislike at first; 
The physic will pay't home.

Enter Low-water.

How dost thou, sir? 
How goes the work?

LOW-WATER 
Your brother has the letter.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I find no stop in't then; it moves well hitherto. 
Did you convey it closely?

LOW-WATER 
He ne'er set eye of me.

[Enter Beveril with a letter] above.

BEVERIL 
I cannot read too often.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[To Low-water] Peace, to your office.

BEVERIL 
What blessed fate took pity of my heart, 
But with her presence to relieve me thus? 
All the large volumes that my time hath master'd 
Are not so precious to adorn my spirit 
As these few lines are to enrich my mind. 
I thirst again to drink of the same fountain. 
[Reading] "Kind Sir, I found your care and love so much in the performance of a little, wherein your wit and art had late employment, that I dare now trust your bosom with business of more weight and eminence. Little thought the world that since the wedding dinner all my mirth was but dissembled, and seeming joys but counterfeit. The truth to you, sir, is, I find so little signs of content in the bargain I made i' th' morning that I began to repent before evening prayer, and to show some fruits of his willful neglect and wild disposition, more than the day could bring forth to me, h'as now forsook my bed; I know no cause for't."

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Aside] But I'll be sworn I do.

BEVERIL 
[Reading] "Being thus distress'd, sir, I desire your comfortable presence and counsel, whom I know to be of worth and judgment, that a lady may safely impart her griefs to you, and commit 'em to the virtues of commiseration and secrecy. Your unfortunate friend, The Widow-wife. I have took order for your private admittance with a trusty servant of mine own, whom I have plac'd at my chamber door to attend your coming." 
He shall not wait too long and curse my slowness!

LOW-WATER 
[Aside] I would you'd come away then.

BEVERIL 
How much am I beguil'd in that young gentleman! 
I would have sworn had been the perfect abstract 
Of honesty and mildness; 'tis not so.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
[Aside] I pardon you, sweet brother; there's no hold 
Of what you speak now: you're in Cupid's pound.

BEVERIL 
Bless'd be the secret hand that brought thee hither; 
But the dear hand that writ it, ten times bless'd!

[Exit above.]

LOW-WATER 
That's I still; h'as bless'd me now ten times at twice. 
Away; I hear him coming.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Strike it sure now.

Exit.

LOW-WATER 
I warrant thee, sweet Kate; choose your best--

Enter Master Beveril.

BEVERIL 
Who's there?

LOW-WATER 
Oh sir, is't you? Y'are welcome then; 
My lady still expects you, sir.

BEVERIL 
Who's with her?

LOW-WATER 
Not any creature living, sir.

BEVERIL 
[Giving him money] Drink that; 
I've made thee wait too long.

LOW-WATER 
It does not seem so now, sir. 
Sir, if a man tread warily as any 
Wise man will, how often may he come 
To a lady's chamber and be welcome to her!

BEVERIL 
Thou giv'st me learned counsel for a closet.

LOW-WATER 
Make use on't, sir, and you shall find no loss in't.

[Exit Beveril.]

So, you are surely in, and you must under.

Enter Kate [Mistress Low-water] with all the guests: Sir Oliver, Master Sunset, Wife [Lady Twilight], Daughter [Grace], Philip, Sandfield, [Jane, Dutch Merchant,] and Savorwit.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Pardon my rude disturbance, my wrongs urge it; 
I did but try the plainness of her mind, 
Suspecting she dealt cunningly with my youth, 
And told her the first night I would not know her; 
But minding to return, I found the door 
Warded suspiciously, and I heard a noise, 
Such as fear makes, and guiltiness at th' approaching 
Of an unlook'd-for husband.

ALL 
This is strange, sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Behold, it's barr'd; I must not be kept out!

SIR OLIVER 
There is no reason, sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I'll be resolv'd in't. 
If you be sons of honour, follow me!

Break open door; rush in.

SAVORWIT 
Then must I stay behind, for I think I was begot i' th' woodyard, and that makes everything go so hard with me.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER within 
That's he! Be sure on him!

Enter confusedly [Mistress Low-water] with the widow [Lady Goldenfleece], and her brother [Beveril] the scholar [and the others].

SIR OLIVER 
Be not so furious, sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
She whispered to him to slip into her closet. 
What, have I taken you? Is not my dream true now? 
Unmerciful adulteress, the first night!

SIR OLIVER 
Nay, good sir, patience!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Give me the villain's heart, 
That I may throw 't into her bosom quick; 
There let the lecher pant!

LADY TWILIGHT 
Nay, sweet sir!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Pardon me; his life's too little for me.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
How am I wrongfully sham'd! Speak your intent, sir, 
Before this company; I pursue no pity.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
This is a fine, thievish juggling, gentlemen. 
She asks her mate that shares in guilt with her. 
Too gross, too gross!

BEVERIL 
[Aside] Rash mischief!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Treacherous sir, 
Did I for this cast a friend's arm about thee, 
Gave thee the welcome of a worthy spirit, 
And lodg'd thee in my house, nay, entertain'd thee 
More like a natural brother than a stranger, 
And have I this reward? Perhaps the pride 
Of thy good parts did lift thee to this impudence. 
Let her make much on 'em; she gets none of me. 
Because thou'rt deeply read in most books else, 
Thou wouldst be so in mine; (indicating Lady Goldenfleece) there it stands for thee: 
Turn o'er the leaves, and where you left, go forward; 
To me, it shall be like the book of fate, 
Ever clasp'd up.

SIR OLIVER 
Oh, dear sir, say not so.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Nay, I'll swear more: forever I refuse her; 
I'll never set a foot into her bed, 
Never perform the duty of man to her 
So long as I have breath.

SIR OLIVER 
What an oath was there, sir! Call't again.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I knew by amorous sparks struck from their eyes 
The fire would appear shortly in a blaze, 
And now it flames indeed. Out of my house, 
And take your gentleman of good parts along with you! 
That shall be all your substance; he can live 
In any emperor's court in Christendom! 
You know what you did, wench, when you chose him 
To thrust out me; you have no politic love! 
You are to learn to make your market, you! 
You can choose wit, a burden light and free, 
And leave the grosser element with me, 
Wealth, foolish trash, I thank you. Out of my doors!

SIR OLIVER 
Nay, good sir, hear her.

LADY TWILIGHT, SUNSET 
Sweet sir!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Pray, to your chambers, gentlemen; I should be here 
Master of what is mine.

SIR OLIVER 
Hear her but speak, sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
What can she speak but woman's common language? 
She's sorry and asham'd for't; that helps nothing.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Sir, since it is the hard hap of my life 
To receive injury where I plac'd my love--

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Why, la, I told you what escapes she'd have!

SIR OLIVER 
Nay, pray, sir, hear her forward.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Let our parting 
Be full as charitable as our meeting was, 
That the pale, envious world, glad of the food 
Of others' miseries, civil dissensions, 
And nuptial strifes, may not feed fat with ours; 
But since you are resolv'd so willfully 
To leave my bed and ever to refuse me, 
As by your rage I find it your desire, 
Though all my actions deserve nothing less, 
Here are our friends, men both of worth and wisdom, 
Place so much power in them to make an evenness 
Between my peace and yours. All my wealth within doors 
In gold and jewels lie in those two caskets 
I lately led you to, the value of which 
Amounts to some five thousand apiece; 
Exchange a charitable hand with me, 
And take one casket freely. Fare thee well, sir.

SIR OLIVER 
How say you to that now?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Troth, I thank her, sir. 
Are not both mine already? You shall wrong me 
And then make satisfaction with mine own? 
I cannot blame you, a good course for you.

LADY TWILIGHT 
I know 'twas not my luck to be so happy; 
My miseries are no starters: when they come, 
Stick longer by me.

SIR OLIVER 
Nay, but give me leave, sir; 
The wealth comes all by her.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
So does the shame, 
Yet that's most mine; why should not that be too?

SIR OLIVER 
Sweet sir, let us rule so much with you: 
Since you intend an obstinate separation, 
Both from her bed and board, give your consent 
To some agreement reasonable and honest.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Must I deal honestly with her lust?

LADY TWILIGHT 
Nay, good sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Why, I tell you, all the wealth her husband left her 
Is not of power to purchase the dear peace 
My heart has lost in these adulterous seas; 
Yet, let her works be base, mine shall be noble.

SIR OLIVER 
That's the best word of comfort I heard yet.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Friends may do much. Go, bring those caskets forth. 
[Exit servants.]

I hate her sight; I'll leave her, though I lose by't.

SIR OLIVER 
Spoke like a noble gentleman, i'faith! 
I'll honour thee for this.

BEVERIL 
[Aside] Oh, cursed man! 
Must thy rash heat force this division?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
You shall have free leave now, without all fear; 
You shall not need oil'd hinges, privy passages, 
Watchings, and whisperings: take him boldly to you.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Oh, that I had that freedom, since my shame 
Puts by all other fortunes, and owns him 
A worthy gentleman. If this cloud were past him, 
I'd marry him, were 't but to spite thee only, 
So much I hate thee now.

Enter servants with two caskets, and the suitors [Sir Gilbert, Weatherwise, Pepperton, and Overdon].

SIR OLIVER 
Here come the caskets, sir; hold your good mind now, 
And we shall make a virtuous end between you.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Though nothing less she merit but a curse, 
That might still hang upon her and consume her still, 
As 't has been many a better woman's fortune 
That has deserv'd less vengeance and felt more, 
Yet my mind scorns to leave her shame so poor.

SIR OLIVER 
Nobly spoke still.

SIR GILBERT 
This strikes me into music; ha, ha!

PEPPERTON 
Parting of goods before the bodies join?

WEATHERWISE 
This 'tis to marry beardless, domineering boys! I knew 'twould come to this pass. Well fare a just almanac yet, for now is Mercury going into the second house near unto Ursa Major, that great hunks, the Bear at the bridge-foot in heaven, which shows horrible bear baitings in wedlock; and the sun near ent'ring into th' Dog sets 'em all together by th' ears.

SIR OLIVER 
[Opening the caskets] You see what's in't?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I think 'tis as I left it.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Then do but gage your faith to this assembly 
That you will ne'er return more to molest me, 
But rest in all revenges full appeas'd 
And amply satisfied with that half my wealth, 
And take 't as freely as life wishes health.

SIR OLIVER 
La, you, sir; come, come, faith, you shall swear that.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Nay, gentlemen, for your sakes, now I'll deal fairly with her.

SIR OLIVER 
I would we might see that, sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I could set her free, 
But now I think on't, she deserves it not.

SUNSET 
Nay, do not check your goodness; pray, sir, on with't.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I could release her ere I parted with her, 
But 'twere a courtesy ill plac'd, and set her 
At as free liberty to marry again, 
As you all know she was before I knew her.

SIR OLIVER 
What, couldst thou, sir?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
But 'tis too good a blessing for her. 
Up with the casket, sirrah!

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Oh, sir, stay!

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I have nothing to say to you.

SIR OLIVER 
Do you hear, sir? 
Pray, let's have one word more with you for our money.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Since y'have expos'd me to all shame and sorrow 
And made me fit but for one hope and fortune 
Bearing my former comforts away with you, 
Show me a parting charity but in this: 
For all my losses, pay me with that freedom, 
And I shall think this treasure as well given 
As ever 'twas ill got.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I might afford it you 
Because I never mean to be more troubled with you; 
But how shall I be sure of the honest use on't, 
How you'll employ that liberty? Perhaps sinfully, 
In wantonness unlawful, and I answer for't; 
So I may live a bawd to your loose works still 
In giving 'em first vent. Not I, shall pardon me; 
I'll see you honestly join'd ere I release you. 
I will not trust you for the last trick you play'd me; 
Here's your old suitors.

PEPPERTON 
Now we thank you, sir.

WEATHERWISE 
My almanac warns me from all cuckoldy conjunctions.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Be but commander of your word now, sir, 
And before all these gentlemen, our friends, 
I'll make a worthy choice.

SUNSET 
Fly not ye back now.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I'll try thee once. I am married to another; 
There's thy release!

SIR OLIVER 
Hoyda! There's a release with a witness! 
Thou'rt free, sweet wench.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Married to another! 
Then in revenge to thee, 
To vex thine eyes, cause thou hast mock'd my heart, 
And with such treachery repaid my love, 
This is the gentleman I embrace and choose.

[Embraces Beveril.]

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Oh, torment to my blood, mine enemy! 
None else to make thy choice of but the man 
From whence my shame took head?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
'Tis done to quit thee. 
Thou that wrong'st woman's love, her hate can fit thee.

SIR OLIVER 
Brave wench, i'faith! Now thou hast an honest gentleman, 
Rid of a swaggering knave, and there's an end on't. 
A man of good parts, this t'other had nothing. 
Life, married to another!

SIR GILBERT 
Oh, brave rascal with two wives!

WEATHERWISE 
Nay, and our women be such subtle animals, I'll lay wait at the carrier's for a country chambermaid and live still a bachelor. When wives are like almanacs, we may have every year a new one, then I'll bestow my money on 'em; in the meantime, I'll give 'em over and ne'er trouble my almanac about 'em.

SIR GILBERT 
I come in a good time to see you hang'd, sir, 
And that's my comfort. Now, I'll tickle you, sir.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
You make me laugh indeed.

SIR GILBERT 
Sir, you remember 
How cunningly you chok'd me at the banquet 
With a fine bawdy letter?

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Your own fist, sir.

SIR GILBERT 
I'll read the statute book to you now for't. 
Turn to the act in Anno Jac. primo: 
There lies a halter for your windpipe.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
Fie, no!

SIR OLIVER 
Faith, but you'll find it so, sir, an't be followed.

WEATHERWISE 
So says my almanac, and he's a true man. 
Look you: [reading] "The thirteenth day, work for the hangman."

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
The fourteenth day, make haste; 'tis time you were there then!

WEATHERWISE 
How, is the book so saucy to tell me so?

BEVERIL 
Sir, I must tell you now, but without gall, 
The law would hang you if married to another.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
You can but put me to my book, sweet brother, 
And I've my neck-verse perfect, here and here.

[She removes her disguise, revealing her bosom.]

Heaven give thee eternal joy, my dear, sweet brother! 
[Embraces Beveril; Low-water removes his disguise.]

ALL 
Who's here?

SIR GILBERT 
[Aside] Oh, devil! Herself! Did she betray me? 
A pox of shame, nine coaches shall not stay me!

Exit Sir Gilbert.

BEVERIL 
I've two such deep healths in two joys to pledge, 
Heaven keep me from a surfeit!

SIR OLIVER 
Mistress Low-water! 
Is she the jealous cuckold all this coil's about? 
And my right worshipful serving-man, is it you, sir?

LOW-WATER 
A poor, wrong'd gentleman, glad to serve for his own, sir.

SIR OLIVER 
By my faith, y'have serv'd the widow a fine trick between you.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
No more my enemy now, my brother's wife, 
And my kind sister.

SIR OLIVER 
There's no starting now from't; 
'Tis her own brother, did not you know that?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
'Twas never told me yet.

SIR OLIVER 
I thought you'd known't.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
What matter is't? 'Tis the same man was chose still, 
No worse now than he was. I'm bound to love you; 
Y'have [exercis'd] in this a double charity, 
Which, to your praise, shall to all times be known, 
Advanc'd my brother and restor'd mine own. 
Nay, somewhat for my wrongs, like a good sister, 
For well you know the tedious suit did cost 
Much pains and fees; I thank you, 'tis not lost. 
You wish'd for love, and, faith, I have bestow'd you 
Upon a gentleman that does dearly love you; 
That recompense I've made you. And you must think, madam, 
I lov'd you well, though I could never ease you, 
When I fetch'd in my brother thus to please you.

SIR OLIVER 
Here's unity forever strangely wrought!

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
I see too late there is a heavy judgment 
Keeps company with extortion and foul deeds, 
And like a wind which vengeance has in chase, 
Drives back the wrongs into the injurer's face. 
My punishment is gentle, and to show 
My thankful mind for't, thus I'll revenge this 
With an embracement here, and here a kiss.

[Embraces Mistress Low-water and kisses Beveril.]

SIR OLIVER 
Why, now the bells they go trim, they go trimly! 
[To Beveril] I wish'd thee, sir, some unexpected blessing 
For my wife's ransom, and 'tis fall'n upon thee.

WEATHERWISE 
[Aside] A pox of this! My almanac ne'er gull'd me till this hour. "The thirteenth day, work for the hangman," and there's nothing toward it; I'd been a fine ass, if I'd given twelve pence for a horse to have rid to Tyburn tomorrow. But now I see the error, 'tis false figured; it should be "thirteen days and a half, work for the hangman," for he ne'er works under thirteen pence half-penny. Beside, Venus being a spot in the sun's garment shows there should be a woman found in hose and doublet.

SIR OLIVER 
Nay, faith, sweet wife, we'll make no more hours on't now; 'tis as fine a contracting time as ever came amongst gentlefolks. Son Philip, Master Sandfield, come to the book here!

PHILIP 
[Aside to Savorwit] Now I'm waked into a thousand miseries and their torments.

SAVORWIT 
[To Philip] And I come after you, sir, drawn with wild horses; there will be a brave show on's anon if this weather continue.

SIR OLIVER 
Come, wenches, where be these young [gentlemen's] hands now?

LADY TWILIGHT 
[Aside] Poor gentleman, my son!-- 
Some other time, sir.

SIR OLIVER 
I'll have 't now, i'faith, wife.

[Puts Philip's hand into Jane's and Sandfield's into Grace's.]

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
What are you making here?

SIR OLIVER 
I have sworn, sweet madam, 
My son shall marry Master Sunset's daughter, 
And Master Sandfield, mine.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
So you go well, sir; 
[Gesturing to Jane] But what make you this way then?

SIR OLIVER 
This? For my son.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Oh, back, sir, back! This is no way for him.

SUNSET, SIR OLIVER 
How?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Oh, let me break an oath to save two souls, 
Lest I should wake another judgment greater! 
You come not here for him, sir.

SIR OLIVER 
What's the matter?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Either give me free leave to make this match 
Or I'll forbid the banes.

SIR OLIVER 
Good madam, take it.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
[Giving Jane to Sandfield] Here, Master Sandfield, then--

SIR OLIVER 
Cuds bodkins!

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Take you this maid.

SANDFIELD 
You could not please me better, madam.

SIR OLIVER 
Hoyda! Is this your hot love to my daughter, sir?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Come hither, Philip; here's a wife for you.

[Gives Grace to Philip.]

SIR OLIVER 
Zunes, he shall ne'er do that! Marry his sister?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Had he been rul'd by you, he had married her, 
But now he marries Master Sunset's daughter, 
And Master Sandfield, yours; I've sav'd your oath, sir.

PHILIP 
Oh, may this blessing hold!

SAVORWIT 
[Aside] Or else all the liquor runs out.

SIR OLIVER 
What riddle's this, madam?

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
A riddle of some fourteen years of age now. 
You can remember, madam, that your daughter 
Was put to nurse to Master Sunset's wife.

LADY TWILIGHT 
True, that we talk'd on lately.

SIR OLIVER 
I grant that, madam.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Then you shall grant what follows. At that time 
You likewise know old Master Sunset here 
Grew backward in the world, till his last fortunes 
Rais'd him to this estate.

SIR OLIVER 
Still this we know too.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
His wife, then nurse both to her own and yours, 
And both so young, of equal years, and daughters, 
Fearing the extremity of her fortunes then 
Should fall upon her infant, to prevent it, 
She chang'd the children, kept your daughter with her, 
And sent her own to you for better fortunes. 
So long, enjoin'd by solemn oath unto't 
Upon her death bed, I have conceal'd this; 
But now so urg'd, here's yours, and this is his.

SAVORWIT 
[Whoop], the joy is come of our side!

WEATHERWISE 
Hay, I'll cast mine almanac to the moon too, and strike out a new one for next year!

PHILIP 
It wants expression, this miraculous blessing!

SAVORWIT 
Methinks I could spring up and knock my head 
Against yon silver ceiling now for joy!

WEATHERWISE 
By my faith, but I do not mean to follow you there, so I may dash out my brains against Charles' Wain and come down as wise as a carman.

SIR OLIVER 
I never wonder'd yet with greater pleasure.

LADY TWILIGHT 
What tears have I bestow'd on a lost daughter 
And left her behind me!

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
This is Grace, 
This Jane; now each has her right name and place.

SUNSET 
I never heard of this.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
I'll swear you did not, sir.

SIR OLIVER 
How well I have kept mine oath against my will! 
Clap hands, and joy go with you. Well said, boys!

PHILIP 
[To Grace] How art thou bless'd from shame and I from ruin!

SAVORWIT 
I, from the baker's ditch, if I'd seen you in.

PHILIP 
Not possible the whole world to match again 
Such grief, such joy, in minutes lost and won.

BEVERIL 
Whoever knew more happiness in less compass? 
Ne'er was poor gentleman so bound to a sister 
As I am for the [wittiness] of thy mind; 
Not only that thy due, but all our wealth 
Shall lie as open as the sun to man 
For thy employments, so the charity 
Of this dear bosom bids me tell thee now.

MISTRESS LOW-WATER 
I am her servant for't.

LADY GOLDENFLEECE 
Hah, worthy sister! 
The government of all I bless thee with.

BEVERIL 
Come, gentlemen, on all perpetual friendship. 
Heaven still relieves what misery would destroy; 
Never was night yet of more general joy.

[Exeunt.]

Epilogue
[WEATHERWISE] 
Now let me see what weather shall we have now. 
[Takes out his almanac.] 
Hold fair now, and I care not. Mass, full moon, too, 
Just between five and six this afternoon! 
This happens right: [reading] "The sky for the best part clear, 
Save here and there a cloud or two dispers'd." 
That's some dozen of panders and half a score 
Pickpockets; you may know them by their whistle, 
And they do well to use that while they may, 
For Tyburn cracks the pipe and spoils the music. 
What says the destiny of the hour this evening? 
Hah! [Reading] "Fear no colours!" By my troth, agreed then: 
The red and white looks cheerfully. For know ye all, 
The planet's Jupiter: you should be jovial; 
There's nothing lets it but the sun i' th' Dog: 
Some bark in corners that will fawn and cog, 
Glad of my fragments for their ember week. 
The sign's in Gemini too: both hands should meet; 
There should be noise i' th' air if all things hap, 
Though I love thunder when you make the clap. 
Some faults perhaps have slipp'd, I am to answer; 
And if in anything your revenge appears, 
Send me in with all your fists about mine ears.

Finis.
