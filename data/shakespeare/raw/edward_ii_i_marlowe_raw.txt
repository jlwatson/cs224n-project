ACT THE FIRST
Act the First, Scene I
[Enter GAVESTON, reading on a letter that was brought him from the KING]

GAVESTON

“My father is deceas’d! Come, Gaveston,
And share the kingdom with thy dearest friend,”
Ah! words that make me surfeit with delight!
What greater bliss can hap to Gaveston 4
Than live and be the favourite of a king!
Sweet prince, I come; these, these thy amorous lines
Might have enforc’d me to have swum from France,
And, like Leander, gasp’d upon the sand, 8
So thou would’st smile, and take me in thine arms.
The sight of London to my exil’d eyes
Is as Elysium to a new-come soul;
Not that I love the city, or the men, 12
But that it harbours him I hold so dear—
The king, upon whose bosom let me die, 1
And with the world be still at enmity.
What need the arctic people love starlight, 16
To whom the sun shines both by day and night?
Farewell base stooping to the lordly peers!
My knee shall bow to none but to the king.
As for the multitude, that are but sparks, 20
Rak’d up in embers of their poverty;—
Tanti; 2 I’ll fawn first on the wind
That glanceth at my lips, and flieth away.
[Enter three Poor Men]

But how now, what are these? 24
POOR MEN

Such as desire your worship’s service.
GAVESTON

What canst thou do?
1ST POOR MAN.

I can ride.
GAVESTON

But I have no horses.—What art thou? 28
2ND POOR MAN

A traveller.
GAVESTON

Let me see: thou would’st do well
To wait at my trencher and tell me lies at dinner time;
And as I like your discoursing, I’ll have you.— 32
And what art thou?
3RD POOR MAN

A soldier, that hath serv’d against the Scot.
GAVESTON

Why, there are hospitals for such as you.
I have no war, and therefore, sir, begone. 36
3RD POOR MAN

Farewell, and perish by a soldier’s hand,
That would’st reward them with an hospital.
GAVESTON

Ay, ay, these words of his move me as much
As if a goose should play the porcupine, 40
And dart her plumes, thinking to pierce my breast.
But yet it is no pain to speak men fair;
I’ll flatter these, and make them live in hope.—
You know that I came lately out of France, [Aside.] 44
And yet I have not view’d my lord the king;
If I speed well, I’ll entertain you all.
ALL

We thank your worship.
GAVESTON

I have some business: leave me to myself. 48
ALL

We will wait here about the court.
[Exeunt.]

GAVESTON

Do. These are not men for me:
I must have wanton poets, pleasant wits,
Musicians, that with touching of a string 52
May draw the pliant king which way I please.
Music and poetry is his delight;
Therefore I’ll have Italian masks by night,
Sweet speeches, comedies, and pleasing shows; 56
And in the day, when he shall walk abroad,
Like sylvan nymphs my pages shall be clad;
My men, like satyrs grazing on the lawns,
Shall with their goat-feet dance an antic hay. 3 60
Sometime a lovely boy in Dian’s shape,
With hair that gilds the water as it glides,
Crownets of pearl about his naked arms,
And in his sportful hands an olive tree, 64
To hide those parts which men delight to see,
Shall bathe him in a spring; and there hard by,
One like ActÆon peeping through the grove
Shall by the angry goddess be transform’d, 68
And running in the likeness of an hart
By yelping hounds pull’d down, and seem to die;—
Such things as these best please his majesty,
My lord.—Here comes the king, and the nobles 72
From the parliament. I’ll stand aside. [Retires.]
[Enter KING EDWARD, LANCASTER, the Elder MORTIMER, Young MORTIMER; EDMUND, EARL of KENT; GUY, EARL of WARWICK, and (Attendants)]

KING EDWARD

Lancaster!
LANCASTER

My lord.
GAVESTON

That Earl of Lancaster do I abhor. [Aside.] 76
KING EDWARD

Will you not grant me this?—In spite of them
I’ll have my will; and these two Mortimers,
That cross me thus, shall know I am displeas’d. [Aside.]
ELDER MORTIMER

If you love us, my lord, hate Gaveston. 80
GAVESTON

That villain Mortimer! I’ll be his death. [Aside.]
YOUNG MORTIMER

Mine uncle here, this earl, and I myself
Were sworn to your father at his death,
That he should ne’er return into the realm; 84
And know, my lord, ere I will break my oath,
This sword of mine, that should offend your foes,
Shall sleep within the scabbard at thy need,
And underneath thy banners march who will, 88
For Mortimer will hang his armour up.
GAVESTON

Mort Dieu! [Aside.]
KING EDWARD

Well, Mortimer, I’ll make thee rue these words.
Beseems it thee to contradict thy king? 92
Frown’st thou thereat, aspiring Lancaster?
The sword shall plane the furrows of thy brows,
And hew these knees that now are grown so stiff.
I will have Gaveston; and you shall know 96
What danger’tis to stand against your king.
GAVESTON

Well done, Ned! [Aside.]
LANCASTER

My lord, why do you thus incense your peers,
That naturally would love and honour you 100
But for that base and obscure Gaveston?
Four earldoms have I, besides Lancaster,—
Derby, Salisbury, Lincoln, Leicester,—
These will I sell, to give my soldiers pay, 104
Ere Gaveston shall stay within the realm;
Therefore, if he be come, expel him straight.
EDMUND, EARL of KENT

Barons and earls, your pride hath made me mute;
But now I’ll speak, and to the proof, I hope. 108
I do remember, in my father’s days,
Lord Percy of the north, being highly mov’d,
Braved Moubery 4 in presence of the king;
For which, had not his highness lov’d him well, 112
He should have lost his head; but with his look
The undaunted spirit of Percy was appeas’d,
And Moubery and he were reconcil’d:
Yet dare you brave the king unto his face?— 116
Brother, revenge it, and let these their heads
Preach upon poles, for trespass of their tongues.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

O, our heads!
KING EDWARD

Ay, yours; and therefore I would wish you grant— 120
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Bridle thy anger, gentle Mortimer.
YOUNG MORTIMER

I cannot, nor I will not; I must speak.—
Cousin, our hands I hope shall fence our heads,
And strike off his that makes you threaten us. 124
Come, uncle, let us leave the brain-sick king,
And henceforth parley with our naked swords.
ELDER MORTIMER

Wiltshire hath men enough to save our heads.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

All Warwickshire will love him for my sake. 5 128
LANCASTER

And northward Gaveston hath many friends.—
Adieu, my lord; and either change your mind,
Or look to see the throne, where you should sit,
To float in blood; and at thy wanton head, 132
The glozing 6 head of thy base minion thrown.
[Exeunt (all except KING EDWARD, KENT, GAVESTON and Attendants)]

KING EDWARD

I cannot brook these haughty menaces.
Am I a king, and must be overrul’d?—
Brother, display my ensigns in the field; 136
I’ll bandy 7 with the barons and the earls,
And either die or live with Gaveston.
GAVESTON

I can no longer keep me from my lord. [Comes forward.]
KING EDWARD

What, Gaveston! welcome!—Kiss not my hand— 140
Embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee.

Why should’st thou kneel? Know’st thou not who I am?
Thy friend, thyself, another Gaveston!
Not Hylas was more mourn’d of Hercules, 144
Than thou hast been of me since thy exile.
GAVESTON

And since I went from hence, no soul in hell
Hath felt more torment than poor Gaveston.
KING EDWARD

I know it.—Brother, welcome home my friend. 148
Now let the treacherous Mortimers conspire,
And that high-minded Earl of Lancaster:
I have my wish, in that I joy thy sight;
And sooner shall the sea o’erwhelm my land, 152
Than bear the ship that shall transport thee hence.
I here create thee Lord High Chamberlain,
Chief Secretary to the state and me,
Earl of Cornwall, King and Lord of Man. 156
GAVESTON

My lord, these titles far exceed my worth.
EDMUND, EARL of KENT

Brother, the least of these may well suffice
For one of greater birth than Gaveston.
KING EDWARD

Cease, brother, for I cannot brook these words. 160
Thy worth, sweet friend, is far above my gifts,
Therefore, to equal it, receive my heart.
If for these dignities thou be envied,
I’ll give thee more; for, but to honour thee, 164
Is Edward pleas’d with kingly regiment. 8
Fear’st 9 thou thy person? Thou shalt have a guard.
Wantest thou gold? Go to my treasury.
Wouldst thou be lov’d and fear’d? Receive my seal; 168
Save or condemn, and in our name command
Whatso thy mind affects, or fancy likes.
GAVESTON

It shall suffice me to enjoy your love,
Which whiles I have, I think myself as great 172
As CÆsar riding in the Roman street,
With captive kings at his triumphant car.
[Enter the BISHOP of COVENTRY]

KING EDWARD

Whither goes my lord of Coventry so fast?
BISHOP OF COVENTRY
To celebrate your father’s exequies. 176
But is that wicked Gaveston return’d?
KING EDWARD

Ay, priest, and lives to be reveng’d on thee,
That wert the only cause of his exile.
GAVESTON

’Tis true; and but for reverence of these robes, 180
Thou should’st not plod one foot beyond this place.
BISHOP OF COVENTRY

I did no more than I was bound to do;
And, Gaveston, unless thou be reclaim’d,
As then I did incense the parliament, 184
So will I now, and thou shalt back to France.
GAVESTON

Saving your reverence, you must pardon me.
KING EDWARD

Throw off his golden mitre, rend his stole,
And in the channel 10 christen him anew. 188
EDMUND, EARL of KENT

Ah, brother, lay not violent hands on him!
For he’ll complain unto the see of Rome.
GAVESTON

Let him complain unto the see of hell;
I’ll be reveng’d on him for my exile. 192
KING EDWARD

No, spare his life, but seize upon his goods.
Be thou lord bishop and receive his rents,
And make him serve thee as thy chaplain.
I give him thee—here, use him as thou wilt. 196
GAVESTON

He shall to prison, and there die in bolts.
KING EDWARD

Ay, to the Tower, the Fleet, or where thou wilt.
BISHOP OF COVENTRY

For this offence, be thou accurst of God!
KING EDWARD

Who’s there? Convey this priest to the Tower. 200
BISHOP OF COVENTRY

True, true.
KING EDWARD

But in the meantime, Gaveston, away,
And take possession of his house and goods.
Come, follow me, and thou shalt have my guard 204
To see it done, and bring thee safe again.
GAVESTON

What should a priest do with so fair a house?
A prison may best beseem his holiness.
[Exeunt.]

Act the First, Scene II. The scene is at Westminster
[Enter (on one side) both the MORTIMERS; (on the other,) WARWICK and LANCASTER]

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

’Tis true, the bishop is in the Tower,
And goods and body given to Gaveston.
LANCASTER

What! will they tyrannise upon the church?
Ah, wicked king! accursed Gaveston! 4
This ground, which is corrupted with their steps,
Shall be their timeless 1 sepulchre or mine.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Well, let that peevish Frenchman guard him sure;
Unless his breast be sword-proof he shall die. 8
ELDER MORTIMER

How now! why droops the Earl of Lancaster?
YOUNG MORTIMER

Wherefore is Guy of Warwick discontent?
LANCASTER

That villain Gaveston is made an earl.
ELDER MORTIMER

An earl! 12
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Ay, and besides Lord Chamberlain of the realm,
And Secretary too, and Lord of Man.
ELDER MORTIMER

We may not, nor we will not suffer this.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Why post we not from hence to levy men? 16
LANCASTER

“My Lord of Cornwall” now at every word!
And happy is the man whom he vouchsafes,
For vailing of his bonnet, 2 one good look.
Thus, arm in arm, the king and he doth march: 20
Nay more, the guard upon his lordship waits;
And all the court begins to flatter him.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Thus leaning on the shoulder of the king,
He nods and scorns and smiles at those that pass. 24
ELDER MORTIMER

Doth no man take exceptions at the slave?
LANCASTER

All stomach 3 him, but none dare speak a word.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Ah, that bewrays their baseness, Lancaster!
Were all the earls and barons of my mind, 28
We’ll hale him from the bosom of the king,
And at the court-gate hang the peasant up,
Who, swoln with venom of ambitious pride,
Will be the ruin of the realm and us. 32
[Enter the ARCHBISHOP of CANTERBURY (and an Attendant)]

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Here comes my lord of Canterbury’s grace.
LANCASTER

His countenance bewrays 4 he is displeas’d.
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

First were his sacred garments rent and torn,
Then laid they violent hands upon him; next 36
Himself imprisoned, and his goods asseiz’d:
This certify the Pope;—away, take horse. [Exit Attendant]
LANCASTER

My lord, will you take arms against the king?
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

What need I? God himself is up in arms, 40
When violence is offered to the church.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Then will you join with us, that be his peers,
To banish or behead that Gaveston?
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

What else, my lords? for it concerns me near; 44
The bishopric of Coventry is his.
[Enter QUEEN ISABELLA]

YOUNG MORTIMER

Madam, whither walks your majesty so fast?
QUEEN ISABELLA

Unto the forest, gentle Mortimer,
To live in grief and baleful discontent; 48
For now, my lord, the king regards me not,
But doats upon the love of Gaveston.
He claps his cheeks, and hangs about his neck,
Smiles in his face, and whispers in his ears; 52
And when I come he frowns, as who should say,
“Go whither thou wilt, seeing I have Gaveston.”
ELDER MORTIMER

Is it not strange that he is thus bewitch’d?
YOUNG MORTIMER

Madam, return unto the court again. 56
That sly inveigling Frenchman we’ll exile,
Or lose our lives; and yet, ere that day come,
The king shall lose his crown; for we have power,
And courage too, to be reveng’d at full. 60
QUEEN ISABELLA

But yet lift not your swords against the king.
LANCASTER

No; but we will lift Gaveston from hence.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

And war must be the means, or he’ll stay still.
QUEEN ISABELLA

Then let him stay; for rather than my lord 64
Shall be oppress’d with civil mutinies,
I will endure a melancholy life,
And let him frolic with his minion.
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

My lords, to ease all this, but hear me speak:— 68
We and the rest, that are his counsellors,
Will meet, and with a general consent
Confirm his banishment with our hands and seals.
LANCASTER

What we confirm the king will frustrate. 72
YOUNG MORTIMER

Then may we lawfully revolt from him.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

But say, my lord, where shall this meeting be?
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

At the New Temple.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Content. 76
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

And, in the meantime, I’ll entreat you all
To cross to Lambeth, and there stay with me.
LANCASTER

Come then, let’s away.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Madam, farewell! 80
QUEEN ISABELLA

Farewell, sweet Mortimer; and, for my sake,
Forbear to levy arms against the king.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Ay, if words will serve; if not, I must.
[Exeunt.]

Act the First, Scene III
[Enter GAVESTON and KENT]

GAVESTON

Edmund, the mighty Prince of Lancaster,
That hath more earldoms than an ass can bear,
And both the Mortimers, two goodly men,
With Guy of Warwick, that redoubted knight, 4
Are gone toward Lambeth—there let them remain! [Exeunt.]
Act the First, Scene IV


[Enter (LANCASTER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, the Elder MORTIMER, Young MORTIMER, the ARCHBISHOP of CANTERBURY and Attendants)]

LANCASTER

Here is the form of Gaveston’s exile:
May it please your lordship to subscribe your name.
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

Give me the paper. [He subscribes, as do the others after him.]
LANCASTER

Quick, quick, my lord; I long to write my name. 4
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

But I long more to see him banish’d hence.
YOUNG MORTIMER

The name of Mortimer shall fright the king,
Unless he be declin’d from that base peasant.
[Enter KING EDWARD, GAVESTON, (and KENT)]

KING EDWARD

What, are you mov’d that Gaveston sits here? 8
It is our pleasure; we will have it so.
LANCASTER

Your grace doth well to place him by your side,
For nowhere else the new earl is so safe.
ELDER MORTIMER

What man of noble birth can brook this sight? 12
Quam male conveniunt! 1
See what a scornful look the peasant casts!
PEMBROKE

Can kingly lions fawn on creeping ants?
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Ignoble vassal, that like Phaeton 16
Aspir’st unto the guidance of the sun!
YOUNG MORTIMER

Their downfall is at hand, their forces down;
We will not thus be fac’d and over-peer’d.
KING EDWARD

Lay hands on that traitor Mortimer! 20
ELDER MORTIMER

Lay hands on that traitor Gaveston!
EDMUND, EARL of KENT

Is this the duty that you owe your king?
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

We know our duties—let him know his peers.
KING EDWARD

Whither will you bear him? Stay, or ye shall die. 24
ELDER MORTIMER

We are no traitors; therefore threaten not.
GAVESTON

No, threaten not, my lord, but pay them home!
Were I a king—
YOUNG MORTIMER

Thou villain, wherefore talk’st thou of a king, 28
That hardly art a gentleman by birth?
KING EDWARD

Were he a peasant, being my minion,
I’ll make the proudest of you stoop to him.
LANCASTER

My lord, you may not thus disparage us.— 32
Away, I say, with hateful Gaveston!
ELDER MORTIMER

And with the Earl of Kent that favours him.
[Attendants remove KENT and GAVESTON.] KING EDWARD

Nay, then, lay violent hands upon your king.
Here, Mortimer, sit thou in Edward’s throne; 36
Warwick and Lancaster, wear you my crown.
Was ever king thus over-rul’d as I?
LANCASTER

Learn then to rule us better, and the realm.
YOUNG MORTIMER

What we have done, our heart-blood shall maintain. 40
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Think you that we can brook this upstart pride?
KING EDWARD

Anger and wrathful fury stops my speech.
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

Why are you mov’d? Be patient, my lord,
And see what we your counsellors have done. 44
YOUNG MORTIMER

My lords, now let us all be resolute,
And either have our wills, or lose our lives.
KING EDWARD

Meet you for this, proud overbearing peers?
Ere my sweet Gaveston shall part from me, 48
This isle shall fleet 2 upon the ocean,
And wander to the unfrequented Inde.
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

You know that I am legate to the Pope.
On your allegiance to the see of Rome, 52
Subscribe, as we have done, to his exile.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Curse him, if he refuse; and then may we
Depose him and elect another king.
KING EDWARD

Ay, there it goes! but yet I will not yield. 56
Curse me, depose me, do the worst you can.
LANCASTER

Then linger not, my lord, but do it straight.
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

Remember how the bishop was abus’d!
Either banish him that was the cause thereof, 60
Or I will presently discharge these lords
Of duty and allegiance due to thee.
KING EDWARD[Aside.]

It boots me not to threat; I must speak fair.—
The legate of the Pope will be obey’d. 64
My lord, you shall be Chancellor of the realm;
Thou, Lancaster, High Admiral of our fleet;
Young Mortimer and his uncle shall be earls;
And you, Lord Warwick, President of the North; 68
And thou, of Wales. If this content you not,
Make several kingdoms of this monarchy,
And share it equally amongst you all,
So I may have some nook or corner left, 72
To frolic with my dearest Gaveston.
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

Nothing shall alter us, we are resolv’d.
LANCASTER

Come, come, subscribe.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Why should you love him whom the world hates so? 76
KING EDWARD

Because he loves me more than all the world.
Ah, none but rude and savage-minded men
Would seek the ruin of my Gaveston;
You that be noble-born should pity him. 80
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

You that are princely-born should shake him off.
For shame subscribe, and let the lown 3 depart.
ELDER MORTIMER

Urge him, my lord.
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

Are you content to banish him the realm? 84
KING EDWARD

I see I must, and therefore am content.
Instead of ink, I’ll write it with my tears. [Subscribes.]
YOUNG MORTIMER

The king is love-sick for his minion.
KING EDWARD

’Tis done; and now, accursed hand, fall off! 88
LANCASTER

Give it me; I’ll have it publish’d in the streets.
YOUNG MORTIMER

I’ll see him presently despatch’d away.
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY

Now is my heart at ease.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

And so is mine. 92
PEMBROKE

This will be good news to the common sort.
ELDER MORTIMER

Be it or no, he shall not linger here.
[Exeunt all except KING EDWARD.] KING EDWARD

How fast they run to banish him I love!
They would not stir, were it to do me good. 96
Why should a king be subject to a priest?
Proud Rome! that hatchest such imperial grooms,
For these thy superstitious taper-lights,
Wherewith thy antichristian churches blaze, 100
I’ll fire thy crazed buildings, and enforce
The papal towers to kiss the lowly ground!
With slaughtered priests make Tiber’s channel swell,
And banks rais’d higher with their sepulchres! 104
As for the peers, that back the clergy thus,
If I be king, not one of them shall live.
[Re-enter GAVESTON]

GAVESTON

My lord, I hear it whispered everywhere,
That I am banish’d, and must fly the land. 108
KING EDWARD

’Tis true, sweet Gaveston—O! were it false!
The legate of the Pope will have it so,
And thou must hence, or I shall be depos’d.
But I will reign to be reveng’d of them; 112
And therefore, sweet friend, take it patiently.
Live where thou wilt, I’ll send thee gold enough;
And long thou shalt not stay, or if thou dost,
I’ll come to thee; my love shall ne’er decline. 116
GAVESTON

Is all my hope turn’d to this hell of grief?
KING EDWARD

Rend not my heart with thy too-piercing words:
Thou from this land, I from myself am banish’d.
GAVESTON

To go from hence grieves not poor Gaveston; 120
But to forsake you, in whose gracious looks
The blessedness of Gaveston remains,
For nowhere else seeks he felicity.
KING EDWARD

And only this torments my wretched soul 124
That, whether I will or no, thou must depart.
Be governor of Ireland in my stead,
And there abide till fortune call thee home.
Here take my picture, and let me wear thine; [They exchange pictures.] 128
O, might I keep thee here as I do this,
Happy were I! but now most miserable!
GAVESTON

’Tis something to be pitied of a king.
KING EDWARD

Thou shalt not hence—I’ll hide thee, Gaveston. 132
GAVESTON

I shall be found, and then ’twill grieve me more.
KING EDWARD

Kind words and mutual talk makes our grief greater;
Therefore, with dumb embracement, let us part.—
Stay, Gaveston, I cannot leave thee thus. 136
GAVESTON

For every look, my lord 4 drops down a tear.
Seeing I must go, do not renew my sorrow.
KING EDWARD

The time is little that thou hast to stay,
And, therefore, give me leave to look my fill. 140
But come, sweet friend, I’ll bear thee on thy way.
GAVESTON

The peers will frown.
KING EDWARD

I pass 5 not for their anger—Come, let’s go;
O that we might as well return as go. 144
[Enter EDMUND and QUEEN ISABELLA]

QUEEN ISABELLA

Whither goes my lord?
KING EDWARD

Fawn not on me, French strumpet! Get thee gone!
QUEEN ISABELLA

On whom but on my husband should I fawn?
GAVESTON

On Mortimer! with whom, ungentle queen— 148
I say no more. Judge you the rest, my lord.
QUEEN ISABELLA

In saying this, thou wrong’st me, Gaveston.
Is’t not enough that thou corrupt’st my lord,
And art a bawd to his affections, 152
But thou must call mine honour thus in question?
GAVESTON

I mean not so; your grace must pardon me.
KING EDWARD

Thou art too familiar with that Mortimer,
And by thy means is Gaveston exil’d; 156
But I would wish thee reconcile the lords,
Or thou shalt ne’er be reconcil’d to me.
QUEEN ISABELLA

Your highness knows it lies not in my power.
KING EDWARD

Away then! touch me not.—Come, Gaveston. 160
QUEEN ISABELLA

Villain! ’tis thou that robb’st me of my lord.
GAVESTON

Madam, ’tis you that rob me of my lord.
KING EDWARD

Speak not unto her; let her droop and pine.
QUEEN ISABELLA

Wherein, my lord, have I deserv’d these words? 164
Witness the tears that Isabella sheds,
Witness this heart, that, sighing for thee, breaks,
How dear my lord is to poor Isabel.
KING EDWARD

And witness Heaven how dear thou art to me! 168
There weep; for till my Gaveston be repeal’d,
Assure thyself thou com’st not in my sight.
[Exeunt EDWARD and GAVESTON.]

QUEEN ISABELLA

O miserable and distressed queen!
Would, when I left sweet France and was embark’d, 172
That charming Circe, walking on the waves,
Had chang’d my shape, or at the marriage-day
The cup of Hymen had been full of poison,
Or with those arms that twin’d about my neck 176
I had been stifled, and not liv’d to see
The king my lord thus to abandon me!
Like frantic Juno will I fill the earth
With ghastly murmur of my sighs and cries; 180
For never doated Jove on Ganymede
So much as he on cursed Gaveston.
But that will more exasperate his wrath;
I must entreat him, I must speak him fair, 184
And be a means to call home Gaveston.
And yet he’ll ever doat on Gaveston;
And so am I for ever miserable.
[Re-enter LANCASTER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, the Elder MORTIMER, and Young MORTIMER]

LANCASTER

Look where the sister of the King of France 188
Sits wringing of her hands, and beats her breast!
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

The king, I fear, hath ill-entreated her.
PEMBROKE

Hard is the heart that injures such a saint.
YOUNG MORTIMER

I know ’tis ’long of Gaveston she weeps. 192
ELDER MORTIMER

Why? He is gone.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Madam, how fares your grace?
QUEEN ISABELLA

Ah, Mortimer! now breaks the king’s hate forth,
And he confesseth that he loves me not. 196
YOUNG MORTIMER

Cry quittance, madam, then; and love not him.
QUEEN ISABELLA

No, rather will I die a thousand deaths!
And yet I love in vain;—he’ll ne’er love me.
LANCASTER

Fear ye not, madam; now his minion’s gone, 200
His wanton humour will be quickly left.
QUEEN ISABELLA

O never, Lancaster! I am enjoin’d
To sue upon you all for his repeal;
This wills my lord, and this must I perform, 204
Or else be banish’d from his highness’ presence.
LANCASTER

For his repeal? Madam, he comes not back,
Unless the sea cast up his shipwreck’d body.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

And to behold so sweet a sight as that, 208
There’s none here but would run his horse to death.
YOUNG MORTIMER

But, madam, would you have us call him home?
QUEEN ISABELLA

Ay, Mortimer, for till he be restor’d,
The angry king hath banish’d me the court; 212
And, therefore, as thou lov’st and tend’rest me,
Be thou my advocate unto these peers.
YOUNG MORTIMER

What! would you have me plead for Gaveston?
ELDER MORTIMER

Plead for him he that will, I am resolv’d. 216
LANCASTER

And so am I, my lord. Dissuade the queen.
QUEEN ISABELLA

O Lancaster! let him dissuade the king,
For ’tis against my will he should return.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Then speak not for him, let the peasant go. 220
QUEEN ISABELLA

’Tis for myself I speak, and not for him.
PEMBROKE

No speaking will prevail, and therefore cease.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Fair queen, forbear to angle for the fish
Which, being caught, strikes him that takes it dead; 224
I mean that vile torpedo, Gaveston,
That now, I hope, floats on the Irish seas.
QUEEN ISABELLA

Sweet Mortimer, sit down by me awhile,
And I will tell thee reasons of such weight 228
As thou wilt soon subscribe to his repeal.
YOUNG MORTIMER

It is impossible; but speak your mind.
QUEEN ISABELLA

Then thus, but none shall hear it but ourselves.
[Talks to Young MORTIMER apart.]

LANCASTER

My lords, albeit the queen win Mortimer, 232
Will you be resolute, and hold with me?
ELDER MORTIMER

Not I, against my nephew.
PEMBROKE

Fear not, the queen’s words cannot alter him.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

No? Do but mark how earnestly she pleads! 236
LANCASTER

And see how coldly his looks make denial!
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

She smiles; now for my life his mind is chang’d!
LANCASTER

I’ll rather lose his friendship, I, than grant.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Well, of necessity it must be so. 240
My lords, that I abhor base Gaveston,
I hope your honours make no question,
And therefore, though I plead for his repeal,
’Tis not for his sake, but for our avail; 244
Nay for the realm’s behoof, and for the king’s.
LANCASTER

Fie, Mortimer, dishonour not thyself!
Can this be true, ’twas good to banish him?
And is this true, to call him home again? 248
Such reasons make white black, and dark night day.
YOUNG MORTIMER

My lord of Lancaster, mark the respect. 6
LANCASTER

In no respect can contraries be true.
QUEEN ISABELLA

Yet, good my lord, hear what he can allege. 252
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

All that he speaks is nothing; we are resolv’d.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Do you not wish that Gaveston were dead?
PEMBROKE

I would he were!
YOUNG MORTIMER

Why, then, my lord, give me but leave to speak. 256
ELDER MORTIMER

But, nephew, do not play the sophister.
YOUNG MORTIMER

This which I urge is of a burning zeal
To mend the king, and do our country good.
Know you not Gaveston hath store of gold, 260
Which may in Ireland purchase him such friends
As he will front the mightest of us all?
And whereas he shall live and be belov’d,
’Tis hard for us to work his overthrow. 264
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Mark you but that, my lord of Lancaster.
YOUNG MORTIMER

But were he here, detested as he is,
How easily might some base slave be suborn’d
To greet his lordship with a poniard, 268
And none so much as blame the murderer,
But rather praise him for that brave attempt,
And in the chronicle enrol his name
For purging of the realm of such a plague! 272
PEMBROKE

He saith true.
LANCASTER

Ay, but how chance this was not done before?
YOUNG MORTIMER

Because, my lords, it was not thought upon.
Nay, more, when he shall know it lies in us 276
To banish him, and then to call him home,
’Twill make him vail 7 the top-flag of his pride,
And fear to offend the meanest nobleman.
ELDER MORTIMER

But how if he do not, nephew? 280
YOUNG MORTIMER

Then may we with some colour rise in arms;
For howsoever we have borne it out,
’Tis treason to be up against the king.
So we shall have the people of our side, 284
Which for his father’s sake lean to the king,
But cannot brook a night-grown mushroom,
Such a one as my lord of Cornwall is,
Should bear us down of the nobility. 288
And when the commons and the nobles join,
’Tis not the king can buckler Gaveston;
We’ll pull him from the strongest hold he hath.
My lords, if to perform this I be slack, 292
Think me as base a groom as Gaveston.
LANCASTER

On that condition, Lancaster will grant.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

And so will Pembroke and I.
ELDER MORTIMER

And I. 296
YOUNG MORTIMER

In this I count me highly gratified,
And Mortimer will rest at your command.
QUEEN ISABELLA

And when this favour Isabel forgets,
Then let her live abandon’d and forlorn.— 300
But see, in happy time, my lord the king,
Having brought the Earl of Cornwall on his way,
Is new return’d. This news will glad him much,
Yet not so much as me. I love him more 304
Than he can Gaveston; would he lov’d me
But half so much, then were I treble-bless’d.
[Re-enter KING EDWARD, mourning]

KING EDWARD

He’s gone, and for his absence thus I mourn.
Did never sorrow go so near my heart 308
As doth the want of my sweet Gaveston;
And could my crown’s revenue bring him back,
I would freely give it to his enemies,
And think I gain’d, having bought so dear a friend. 312
QUEEN ISABELLA

Hark! how he harps upon his minion.
KING EDWARD

My heart is as an anvil unto sorrow,
Which beats upon it like the Cyclops’ hammers,
And with the noise turns up my giddy brain, 316
And makes me frantic for my Gaveston.
Ah! had some bloodless Fury rose from hell,
And with my kingly sceptre struck me dead,
When I was forc’d to leave my Gaveston! 320
LANCASTER

Diablo! What passions call you these?
QUEEN ISABELLA

My gracious lord, I come to bring you news.
KING EDWARD

That you have parley’d with your Mortimer!
QUEEN ISABELLA

That Gaveston, my lord, shall be repeal’d. 324
KING EDWARD

Repeal’d! The news is too sweet to be true?
QUEEN ISABELLA

But will you love me, if you find it so?
KING EDWARD

If it be so, what will not Edward do?
QUEEN ISABELLA

For Gaveston, but not for Isabel. 328
KING EDWARD

For thee, fair queen, if thou lov’st Gaveston.
I’ll hang a golden tongue about thy neck,
Seeing thou hast pleaded with so good success.
QUEEN ISABELLA

No other jewels hang about my neck 332
Than these, my lord; nor let me have more wealth
Than I may fetch from this rich treasury.
O how a kiss revives poor Isabel!
KING EDWARD

Once more receive my hand; and let this be 336
A second marriage ’twixt thyself and me.
QUEEN ISABELLA

And may it prove more happy than the first!
My gentle lord, bespeak these nobles fair,
That wait attendance for a gracious look, 340
And on their knees salute your majesty.
KING EDWARD

Courageous Lancaster, embrace thy king!
And, as gross vapours perish by the sun,
Even so let hatred with thy sovereign’s smile. 344
Live thou with me as my companion.
LANCASTER
This salutation overjoys my heart.
KING EDWARD

Warwick shall be my chiefest counsellor:
These silver hairs will more adorn my court 348
Than gaudy silks, or rich embroidery.
Chide me, sweet Warwick, if I go astray.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Slay me, my lord, when I offend your grace.
KING EDWARD

In solemn triumphs, and in public shows, 352
Pembroke shall bear the sword before the king.
PEMBROKE

And with this sword Pembroke will fight for you.
KING EDWARD

But wherefore walks young Mortimer aside?
Be thou commander of our royal fleet; 356
Or, if that lofty office like thee not,
I make thee here Lord Marshal of the realm.
YOUNG MORTIMER

My lord, I’ll marshal so your enemies,
As England shall be quiet, and you safe. 360
KING EDWARD

And as for you, Lord Mortimer of Chirke,
Whose great achievements in our foreign war
Deserves no common place nor mean reward,
Be you the general of the levied troops, 364
That now are ready to assail the Scots.
ELDER MORTIMER

In this your grace hath highly honoured me,
For with my nature war doth best agree.
QUEEN ISABELLA

Now is the King of England rich and strong, 368
Having the love of his renowned peers.
KING EDWARD

Ay, Isabel, ne’er was my heart so light.
Clerk of the crown, direct our warrant forth
For Gaveston to Ireland: 372
[Enter BEAUMONT with warrant.]

Beaumont, fly
As fast as Iris or Jove’s Mercury.
BEAUMONT

It shall be done, my gracious lord.
[Exit.] KING EDWARD

Lord Mortimer, we leave you to your charge. 376
Now let us in, and feast it royally.
Against our friend the Earl of Cornwall comes,
We’ll have a general tilt and tournament;
And then his marriage shall be solemnis’d. 380
For wot you not that I have made him sure 8
Unto our cousin, the Earl of Gloucester’s heir?
LANCASTER

Such news we hear, my lord.
KING EDWARD

That day, if not for him, yet for my sake, 384
Who in the triumph will be challenger,
Spare for no cost; we will requit your love.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

In this, or aught, your highness shall command us.
KING EDWARD

Thanks, gentle Warwick: come, let’s in and revel. 388
[Exeunt all except the MORTIMERS.] ELDER MORTIMER

Nephew, I must to Scotland; thou stayest here.
Leave now t’oppose thyself against the king.
Thou seest by nature he is mild and calm,
And, seeing his mind so doats on Gaveston, 392
Let him without controlment have his will.
The mightiest kings have had their minions:
Great Alexander loved Hephestion;
The conquering Hercules 9 for Hylas wept; 396
And for Patroclus stern Achilles drooped
And not kings only, but the wisest men:
The Roman Tully lov’d Octavius;
Grave Socrates, wild Alcibiades. 400
Then let his grace, whose youth is flexible,
And promiseth as much as we can wish,
Freely enjoy that vain, light-headed earl;
For riper years will wean him from such toys. 404
YOUNG MORTIMER

Uncle, his wanton humour grieves not me;
But this I scorn, that one so basely born
Should by his sovereign’s favour grow so pert,
And riot it with the treasure of the realm. 408
While soldiers mutiny for want of pay,
He wears a lord’s revenue on his back,
And Midas-like, he jets 10 it in the court,
With base outlandish cullions 11 at his heels, 412
Whose proud fantastic liveries make such show
As if that Proteus, god of shapes, appear’d.
I have not seen a dapper Jack so brisk;
He wears a short Italian hooded cloak 416
Larded with pearl, and, in his Tuscan cap,
A jewel of more value than the crown.
While others walk below, the king and he
From out a window laugh at such as we, 420
And flout our train, and jest at our attire.
Uncle, ’tis this that makes me impatient.
ELDER MORTIMER

But, nephew, now you see the king is chang’d.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Then so am I, and live to do him service: 424
But whiles I have a sword, a hand, a heart,
I will not yield to any such upstart.
You know my mind; come, uncle, let’s away.
[Exeunt.]
