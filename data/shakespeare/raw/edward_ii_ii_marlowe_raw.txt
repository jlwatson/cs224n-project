ACT THE SECOND
Act the Second, Scene I. Gloucester’s house
[Enter Young SPENCER and BALDOCK]

BALDOCK

Spencer,
Seeing that our lord the Earl of Gloucester’s dead,
Which of the nobles dost thou mean to serve?
YOUNG SPENCER

Not Mortimer, nor any of his side, 4
Because the king and he are enemies.
Baldock, learn this of me, a factious lord
Shall hardly do himself good, much less us;
But he that hath the favour of a king, 8
May with one word advance us while we live.
The liberal Earl of Cornwall is the man
On whose good fortune Spencer’s hopes depends.
BALDOCK

What, mean you then to be his follower? 12
YOUNG SPENCER

No, his companion; for he loves me well,
And would have once preferr’d me to the king.
BALDOCK

But he is banish’d; there’s small hope of him.
YOUNG SPENCER

Ay, for a while; but, Baldock, mark the end. 16
A friend of mine told me in secrecy
That he’s repeal’d, and sent for back again;
And even now a post came from the court
With letters to our lady from the king; 20
And as she read she smil’d, which makes me think
It is about her lover Gaveston.
BALDOCK

’Tis like enough; for since he was exil’d
She neither walks abroad, nor comes in sight. 24
But I had thought the match had been broke off,
And that his banishment had chang’d her mind.
YOUNG SPENCER

Our lady’s first love is not wavering;
My life for thine, she will have Gaveston. 28
BALDOCK

Then hope I by her means to be preferr’d,
Having read unto her since she was a child.
YOUNG SPENCER

Then, Baldock, you must cast the scholar off,
And learn to court it like a gentleman. 32
’Tis not a black coat and a little band,
A velvet-cap’d coat, fac’d before with serge,
And smelling to a nosegay all the day,
Or holding of a napkin in your hand, 36
Or saying a long grace at a table’s end,
Or making low legs 1 to a nobleman,
Or looking downward with your eyelids close,
And saying, “Truly, an’t 2 may please your honour,” 40
Can get you any favour with great men;
You must be proud, bold, pleasant, resolute,
And now and then stab, as occasion serves.
BALDOCK

Spencer, thou know’st I hate such formal toys, 44
And use them but of mere hypocrisy.
Mine old lord whiles he liv’d was so precise,
That he would take exceptions at my buttons,
And being like pin’s heads, blame me for the bigness; 48
Which made me curate-like in mine attire,
Though inwardly licentious enough
And apt for any kind of villainy.
I am none of these common pedants, I, 52
That cannot speak without propterea quod.
YOUNG SPENCER

But one of those that saith quandoquidem,
And hath a special gift to form a verb.
BALDOCK

Leave off this jesting, here my lady comes. 56
[Enter the Lady (KING EDWARD’S Niece.)]

NIECE

The grief for his exile was not so much
As is the joy of his returning home.
This letter came from my sweet Gaveston:—
What need’st thou, love, thus to excuse thyself? 60
I know thou could’st not come and visit me.
[Reads.]

“I will not long be from thee, though I die.”
This argues the entire love of my lord;
[Reads.]

“When I forsake thee, death seize on my heart:” 64
But stay thee here where Gaveston shall sleep.
[Puts the letter into her bosom.]

Now to the letter of my lord the king.—
He wills me to repair unto the court, 68
And meet my Gaveston? Why do I stay,
Seeing that he talks thus of my marriage-day?
Who’s there? Baldock!
See that my coach be ready, I must hence. 72
BALDOCK

It shall be done, madam.
NIECE

And meet me at the park-pale presently.
[Exit BALDOCK.]

Spencer, stay you and bear me company,
For I have joyful news to tell thee of. 76
My lord of Cornwall is a-coming over,
And will be at the court as soon as we.
YOUNG SPENCER

I knew the king would have him home again.
NIECE

If all things sort out as I hope they will, 80
Thy service, Spencer, shall be thought upon.
YOUNG SPENCER

I humbly thank your ladyship.
NIECE

Come, lead the way; I long till I am there.
[Exeunt.]



Act the Second, Scene II
[Enter KING EDWARD, QUEEN ISABELLA, KENT, LANCASTER, Young MORTIMER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, and Attendants]

KING EDWARD

The wind is good, I wonder why he stays;
I fear me he is wrack’d upon the sea.
QUEEN ISABELLA

Look, Lancaster, how passionate 1 he is,
And still his mind runs on his minion! 4
LANCASTER

My lord,—
KING EDWARD

How now! what news? Is Gaveston arriv’d?
YOUNG MORTIMER

Nothing but Gaveston!—What means your grace?
You have matters of more weight to think upon; 8
The King of France sets foot in Normandy.
KING EDWARD

A trifle! we’ll expel him when we please.
But tell me, Mortimer, what’s thy device
Against the stately triumph we decreed? 12
YOUNG MORTIMER

A homely one, my lord, not worth the telling.
KING EDWARD

Pray thee let me know it.
YOUNG MORTIMER

But, seeing you are so desirous, thus it is:
A lofty cedar-tree, fair flourishing, 16
On whose top-branches kingly eagles perch,
And by the bark a canker 2 creeps me up,
And gets into the highest bough of all:
The motto, Æque tandem. 3 20
KING EDWARD

And what is yours, my lord of Lancaster?
LANCASTER

My lord, mine’s more obscure than Mortimer’s.
Pliny reports there is a flying fish
Which all the other fishes deadly hate, 24
And therefore, being pursued, it takes the air:
No sooner is it up, but there’s a fowl
That seizeth it; this fish, my lord, I bear:
The motto this: Undique mors est. 28
KING EDWARD

Proud Mortimer! ungentle Lancaster!
Is this the love you bear your sovereign?
Is this the fruit your reconcilement bears?
Can you in words make show of amity, 32
And in your shields display your rancorous minds!
What call you this but private libelling
Against the Earl of Cornwall and my brother?
QUEEN ISABELLA

Sweet husband, be content, they all love you. 36
KING EDWARD

They love me not that hate my Gaveston.
I am that cedar, shake me not too much;
And you the eagles; soar ye ne’er so high,
I have the jesses that will pull you down; 40
And Æque tandem shall that canker cry
Unto the proudest peer of Britainy.
Though thou compar’st him to a flying fish,
And threatenest death whether he rise or fall, 44
’Tis not the hugest monster of the sea,
Nor foulest harpy that shall swallow him.
YOUNG MORTIMER

If in his absence thus he favours him,
What will he do whenas he shall be present? 48
LANCASTER

That shall we see; look where his lordship comes.
[Enter GAVESTON]

KING EDWARD

My Gaveston!
Welcome to Tynemouth! Welcome to thy friend!
Thy absence made me droop and pine away; 52
For, as the lovers of fair Danae,
When she was lock’d up in a brazen tower,
Desired her more, and wax’d outrageous,
So did it fare with me; and now thy sight 56
Is sweeter far than was thy parting hence
Bitter and irksome to my sobbing heart.
GAVESTON

Sweet lord and king, your speech preventeth 7 mine,
Yet have I words left to express my joy: 60
The shepherd nipt with biting winter’s rage
Frolics not more to see the painted spring,
Than I do to behold your majesty.
KING EDWARD

Will none of you salute my Gaveston? 64
LANCASTER

Salute him? yes. Welcome, Lord Chamberlain!
YOUNG MORTIMER

Welcome is the good Earl of Cornwall!
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Welcome, Lord Governor of the Isle of Man!
PEMBROKE

Welcome, Master Secretary! 68
EDMUND, EARL of KENT

Brother, do you hear them?
KING EDWARD

Still will these earls and barons use me thus.
GAVESTON

My lord, I cannot brook these injuries.
QUEEN ISABELLA

Aye me, poor soul, when these begin to jar. [Aside.] 72
KING EDWARD

Return it to their throats, I’ll be thy warrant.
GAVESTON

Base, leaden earls, that glory in your birth,
Go sit at home and eat your tenants’ beef;
And come not here to scoff at Gaveston, 76
Whose mounting thoughts did never creep so low
As to bestow a look on such as you.
LANCASTER

Yet I disdain not to do this for you. [Draws his sword and offers to stab GAVESTON.]
KING EDWARD

Treason! treason! where’s the traitor? 80
PEMBROKE

Here! here!
KING EDWARD

Convey hence Gaveston; they’ll murder him.
GAVESTON

The life of thee shall salve this foul disgrace.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Villain! thy life, unless I miss mine aim. [Wounds GAVESTON.] 84
QUEEN ISABELLA

Ah! furious Mortimer, what hast thou done?
YOUNG MORTIMER

No more than I would answer, were he slain. [Exit GAVESTON with Attendants.]
KING EDWARD

Yes, more than thou canst answer, though he live.
Dear shall you both abye this riotous deed. 88
Out of my presence! Come not near the court.
YOUNG MORTIMER

I’ll not be barr’d the court for Gaveston.
LANCASTER

We’ll hale him by the ears unto the block.
KING EDWARD

Look to your own heads; his is sure enough. 92
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Look to your own crown, if you back him thus.
EDMUND, EARL of KENT

Warwick, these words do ill beseem thy years.
KING EDWARD

Nay, all of them conspire to cross me thus;
But if I live, I’ll tread upon their heads 96
That think with high looks thus to tread me down.
Come, Edmund, let’s away and levy men,
’Tis war that must abate these barons’ pride.
[Exeunt KING EDWARD, (QUEEN ISABELLA and KENT.}] GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Let’s to our castles, for the king is mov’d. 100
YOUNG MORTIMER

Mov’d may he be, and perish in his wrath!
LANCASTER

Cousin, it is no dealing with him now,
He means to make us stoop by force of arms;
And therefore let us jointly here protest, 104
To persecute that Gaveston to the death.
YOUNG MORTIMER

By heaven, the abject villain shall not live!
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

I’ll have his blood, or die in seeking it.
PEMBROKE

The like oath Pembroke takes. 108
LANCASTER

And so doth Lancaster.
Now send our heralds to defy the king;
And make the people swear to put him down.
[Enter a Messenger]

YOUNG MORTIMER

Letters! From whence? 112
MESSENGER

From Scotland, my lord. [Giving letters to MORTIMER.]
LANCASTER

Why, how now, cousin, how fares all our friends?
YOUNG MORTIMER

My uncle’s taken prisoner by the Scots.
LANCASTER

We’ll have him ransom’d, man; be of good cheer. 116
YOUNG MORTIMER

They rate his ransom at five thousand pound.
Who should defray the money but the king,
Seeing he is taken prisoner in his wars?
I’ll to the king. 120
LANCASTER

Do, cousin, and I’ll bear thee company.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Meantime, my lord of Pembroke and myself
Will to Newcastle here, and gather head. 9
YOUNG MORTIMER

About it then, and we will follow you. 124
LANCASTER

Be resolute and full of secrecy.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

I warrant you.
[Exit with PEMBROKE.] YOUNG MORTIMER

Cousin, and if he will not ransom him,
I’ll thunder such a peal into his ears, 128
As never subject did unto his king.
LANCASTER

Content, I’ll bear my part—Holla! who’s there?
[Enter Guard]

YOUNG MORTIMER

Ay, marry, such a guard as this doth well.
LANCASTER

Lead on the way. 132
GUARD

Whither will your lordships?
YOUNG MORTIMER

Whither else but to the king.
GUARD

His highness is dispos’d to be alone.
LANCASTER

Why, so he may, but we will speak to him. 136
GUARD

You may not in, my lord.
YOUNG MORTIMER

May we not?
[Enter KING EDWARD and KENT]

KING EDWARD

How now!
What noise is this? Who have we there? Is’t you? [Going.] 140
YOUNG MORTIMER

Nay, stay, my lord, I come to bring you news;
Mine uncle’s taken prisoner by the Scots.
KING EDWARD

Then ransom him.
LANCASTER

’Twas in your wars; you should ransom him. 144
YOUNG MORTIMER

And you shall ransom him, or else——s
EDMUND, EARL of KENT

What! Mortimer, you will not threaten him?
KING EDWARD

Quiet yourself, you shall have the broad seal,
To gather for him throughout the realm. 148
LANCASTER

Your minion Gaveston hath taught you this.
YOUNG MORTIMER

My lord, the family of the Mortimers
Are not so poor, but, would they sell their land,
’Twould levy men enough to anger you. 152
We never beg, but use such prayers as these.
KING EDWARD

Shall I still be haunted thus?
YOUNG MORTIMER

Nay, now you’re here alone, I’ll speak my mind.
LANCASTER

And so will I, and then, my lord, farewell. 156
YOUNG MORTIMER

The idle triumphs, masks, lascivious shows,
And prodigal gifts bestow’d on Gaveston,
Have drawn thy treasury dry, and made thee weak;
The murmuring commons, overstretched, break. 160
LANCASTER

Look for rebellion, look to be depos’d.
Thy garrisons are beaten out of France,
And, lame and poor, lie groaning at the gates.
The wild O’Neill, with swarms of Irish kerns, 10 164
Lives uncontroll’d within the English pale.
Unto the walls of York the Scots made road, 11
And unresisted drave away rich spoils.
YOUNG MORTIMER

The haughty Dane commands the narrow seas, 168
While in the harbour ride thy ships unrigg’d.
LANCASTER

What foreign prince sends thee ambassadors?
YOUNG MORTIMER

Who loves thee, but a sort of flatterers?
LANCASTER

Thy gentle queen, sole sister to Valois, 172
Complains that thou hast left her all forlorn.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Thy court is naked, being bereft of those
That make a king seem glorious to the world;
I mean the peers, whom thou should’st dearly love. 176
Libels are cast again thee in the street;
Ballads and rhymes made of thy overthrow.
LANCASTER

The Northern borderers seeing their houses burnt,
Their wives and children slain, run up and down, 180
Cursing the name of thee and Gaveston.
YOUNG MORTIMER

When wert thou in the field with banner spread,
But once? and then thy soldiers marched like players,
With garish robes, not armour; and thyself, 184
Bedaub’d with gold, rode laughing at the rest,
Nodding and shaking of thy spangled crest,
Where women’s favours hung like labels down.
LANCASTER

And therefore came it, that the fleering 13 Scots, 188
To England’s high disgrace, have made this jig;
“Maids of England, sore may you mourn,—
For your lemans you have lost at Bannocksbourn,— 15
With a heave and a ho!
What weeneth the King of England,
So soon to have won Scotland?—
With a rombelow!”
YOUNG MORTIMER

Wigmore shall fly, to set my uncle free.
LANCASTER

And when ’tis gone, our swords shall purchase more.
If ye be mov’d, revenge it as you can; 192
Look next to see us with our ensigns spread.
[Exit with Young MORTIMER.]

KING EDWARD

My swelling heart for very anger breaks!
How oft have I been baited by these peers,
And dare not be reveng’d, for their power is great! 196
Yet, shall the crowing of these cockerels
Affright a lion? Edward, unfold thy paws,
And let their lives’ blood slake thy fury’s hunger.
If I be cruel and grow tyrannous, 200
Now let them thank themselves, and rue too late.
EDMUND, EARL of KENT

My lord, I see your love to Gaveston
Will be the ruin of the realm and you,
For now the wrathful nobles threaten wars, 204
And therefore, brother, banish him for ever.
KING EDWARD

Art thou an enemy to my Gaveston?
EDMUND, EARL of KENT

Ay, and it grieves me that I favoured him.
KING EDWARD

Traitor, begone! whine thou with Mortimer. 208
EDMUND, EARL of KENT

So will I, rather than with Gaveston.
KING EDWARD

Out of my sight, and trouble me no more!
EDMUND, EARL of KENT

No marvel though thou scorn thy noble peers,
When I thy brother am rejected thus. 212
KING EDWARD

Away!
[Exit KENT.]

Poor Gaveston, that has no friend but me,
Do what they can, we’ll live in Tynemouth here,
And, so I walk with him about the walls, 216
What care I though the earls begirt us round?—
Here comes she that is cause of all these jars.
[Enter QUEEN ISABELLA with (KING EDWARD’S Niece, two) Ladies, (GAVESTON,) BALDOCK and Young SPENCER]

QUEEN ISABELLA

My lord, ’tis thought the earls are up in arms.
KING EDWARD

Ay, and ’tis likewise thought you favour ’em. 220
QUEEN ISABELLA

Thus do you still suspect me without cause?
NIECE

Sweet uncle! speak more kindly to the queen.
GAVESTON

My lord, dissemble with her, speak her fair.
KING EDWARD

Pardon me, sweet, I forgot myself. 224
QUEEN ISABELLA

Your pardon is quickly got of Isabel.
KING EDWARD

The younger Mortimer is grown so brave,
That to my face he threatens civil wars.
GAVESTON

Why do you not commit him to the Tower? 228
KING EDWARD

I dare not, for the people love him well.
GAVESTON

Why, then we’ll have him privily made away.
KING EDWARD

Would Lancaster and he had both carous’d
A bowl of poison to each other’s health! 232
But let them go, and tell me what are these?
NIECE

Two of my father’s servants whilst he liv’d,—
May’st please your grace to entertain them now.
KING EDWARD

Tell me, where wast thou born? What is thine arms? 236
BALDOCK

My name is Baldock, and my gentry
I fetch from Oxford, not from heraldry.
KING EDWARD

The fitter art thou, Baldock, for my turn.
Wait on me, and I’ll see thou shalt not want. 240
BALDOCK

I humbly thank your majesty.
KING EDWARD

Knowest thou him, Gaveston?
GAVESTON

Ay, my lord;
His name is Spencer, he is well allied; 244
For my sake, let him wait upon your grace;
Scarce shall you find a man of more desert.
KING EDWARD

Then, Spencer, wait upon me; for his sake
I’ll grace thee with a higher style ere long. 248
YOUNG SPENCER

No greater titles happen unto me,
Than to be favoured of your majesty!
KING EDWARD

Cousin, this day shall be your marriage-feast.
And, Gaveston, think that I love thee well, 252
To wed thee to our niece, the only heir
Unto the Earl of Gloucester late deceas’d.
GAVESTON

I know, my lord, many will stomach me,
But I respect neither their love nor hate. 256
KING EDWARD

The headstrong barons shall not limit me;
He that I list to favour shall be great.
Come, let’s away; and when the marriage ends,
Have at the rebels, and their ’complices! [Exeunt.] 260


Act the Second, Scene III. Near Tynemouth Castle
[Enter KENT, LANCASTER, Young MORTIMER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, and others]

EDMUND, EARL of KENT

My lords, of love to this our native land
I come to join with you and leave the king;
And in your quarrel and the realm’s behoof
Will be the first that shall adventure life. 4
LANCASTER

I fear me, you are sent of policy,
To undermine us with a show of love.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

He is your brother, therefore have we cause
To cast 1 the worst, and doubt of your revolt. 8
EDMUND, EARL of KENT

Mine honour shall be hostage of my truth;
If that will not suffice, farewell, my lords.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Stay, Edmund; never was Plantagenet
False to his word, and therefore trust we thee. 12
PEMBROKE

But what’s the reason you should leave him now?
EDMUND, EARL of KENT

I have inform’d the Earl of Lancaster.
LANCASTER

And it sufficeth. Now, my lords, know this,
That Gaveston is secretly arriv’d, 16
And here in Tynemouth frolics with the king.
Let us with these our followers scale the walls,
And suddenly surprise them unawares.
YOUNG MORTIMER

I’ll give the onset. 20
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

And I’ll follow thee.
YOUNG MORTIMER

This tottered ensign of my ancestors
Which swept the desert shore of that dead sea
Whereof we got the name of Mortimer, 24
Will I advance upon these castle-walls.
Drums, strike alarum, raise them from their sport,
And ring aloud the knell of Gaveston!
LANCASTER

None be so hardy as to touch the king; 28
But neither spare you Gaveston nor his friends.
[Exeunt.]

Act the Second, Scene IV. Near Tynemouth Castle
[Enter KING EDWARD and Young SPENCER]

KING EDWARD

O tell me, Spencer, where is Gaveston?
YOUNG SPENCER

I fear he is slain, my gracious lord.
KING EDWARD

No, here he comes; now let them spoil and kill.
[Enter QUEEN ISABELLA, KING EDWARD’S Niece, GAVESTON, and Nobles]

Fly, fly, my lords, the earls have got the hold; 4
Take shipping and away to Scarborough;
Spencer and I will post away by land.
GAVESTON

O stay, my lord, they will not injure you.
KING EDWARD

I will not trust them; Gaveston, away! 8
GAVESTON

Farewell, my lord.
KING EDWARD

Lady, farewell.
NIECE

Farewell, sweet uncle, till we meet again.
KING EDWARD

Farewell, sweet Gaveston; and farewell, niece. 12
QUEEN ISABELLA

No farewell to poor Isabel thy queen?
KING EDWARD

Yes, yes, for Mortimer, your lover’s sake.
[Exeunt all but QUEEN ISABELLA.] QUEEN ISABELLA

Heavens can witness I love none but you:
From my embracements thus he breaks away. 16
O that mine arms could close this isle about,
That I might pull him to me where I would!
Or that these tears that drizzle from mine eyes
Had power to mollify his stony heart, 20
That when I had him we might never part.
[Enter LANCASTER, WARWICK, Young MORTIMER, and others. Alarums]

LANCASTER

I wonder how he scap’d!
YOUNG MORTIMER

Who’s this? The queen!
QUEEN ISABELLA

Ay, Mortimer, the miserable queen, 24
Whose pining heart her inward sighs have blasted,
And body with continual mourning wasted:
These hands are tir’d with haling of my lord
From Gaveston, from wicked Gaveston, 28
And all in vain; for, when I speak him fair,
He turns away, and smiles upon his minion.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Cease to lament, and tell us where’s the king?
QUEEN ISABELLA

What would you with the king? Is’t him you seek? 32
LANCASTER

No, madam, but that cursed Gaveston.
Far be it from the thought of Lancaster
To offer violence to his sovereign.
We would but rid the realm of Gaveston: 36
Tell us where he remains, and he shall die.
QUEEN ISABELLA

He’s gone by water unto Scarborough;
Pursue him quickly, and he cannot ’scape;
The king hath left him, and his train is small. 40
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Foreslow no time, sweet Lancaster; let’s march.
YOUNG MORTIMER

How comes it that the king and he is parted?
QUEEN ISABELLA

That thus your army, going several ways,
Might be of lesser force; and with the power 44
That he intendeth presently to raise,
Be easily suppress’d; therefore be gone.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Here in the river rides a Flemish hoy;
Let’s all aboard, and follow him amain. 48
LANCASTER

The wind that bears him hence will fill our sails:
Come, come aboard, ’tis but an hour’s sailing.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Madam, stay you within this castle here.
QUEEN ISABELLA

No, Mortimer, I’ll to my lord the king. 52
YOUNG MORTIMER

Nay, rather sail with us to Scarborough.
QUEEN ISABELLA

You know the king is so suspicious,
As if he hear I have but talk’d with you,
Mine honour will be call’d in question; 56
And therefore, gentle Mortimer, be gone.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Madam, I cannot stay to answer you,
But think of Mortimer as he deserves.
[Exeunt all except QUEEN ISABELLA.]

QUEEN ISABELLA

So well hast thou deserv’d sweet Mortimer, 60
As Isabel could live with thee for ever!
In vain I look for love at Edward’s hand,
Whose eyes are fix’d on none but Gaveston;
Yet once more I’ll importune him with prayers. 64
If he be strange and not regard my words,
My son and I will over into France,
And to the king my brother there complain,
How Gaveston hath robb’d me of his love: 68
But yet I hope my sorrows will have end,
And Gaveston this blessed day be slain.
[Exit.]



Act the Second, Scene V
[Enter GAVESTON, pursued]

GAVESTON

Yet, lusty lords, I have escap’d your hands,
Your threats, your ’larums, and your hot pursuits;
And though divorced from King Edward’s eyes,
Yet liveth Pierce of Gaveston unsurpris’d, 4
Breathing, in hope (malgrado 2 all your beards,
That muster rebels thus against your king),
To see his royal sovereign once again.
[Enter (WARWICK, LANCASTER, PEMBROKE, Young MORTIMER, Soldiers, JAMES, and other Attendants of PEMBROKE)]

GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Upon him, soldiers, take away his weapons. 8
YOUNG MORTIMER

Thou proud disturber of thy country’s peace,
Corrupter of thy king, cause of these broils,
Base flatterer, yield! and were it not for shame,
Shame and dishonour to a soldier’s name, 12
Upon my weapon’s point here should’st thou fall,
And welter in thy gore.
LANCASTER

Monster of men!
That, like the Greekish strumpet, train’d to arms 16
And bloody wars so many valiant knights;
Look for no other fortune, wretch, than death!
King Edward is not here to buckler thee.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Lancaster, why talk’st thou to the slave? 20
Go, soldiers, take him hence, for, by my sword,
His head shall off. Gaveston, short warning
Shall serve thy turn; it is our country’s cause
That here severely we will execute 24
Upon thy person. Hang him at a bough.
GAVESTON

My lord!—
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Soldiers, have him away;—
But for thou wert the favourite of a king, 28
Thou shalt have so much honour at our hands—
GAVESTON

I thank you all, my lords: then I perceive,
That heading is one, and hanging is the other,
And death is all. 32
[Enter EARL OF ARUNDEL]

LANCASTER

How now, my lord of Arundel?
EARL OF ARUNDEL

My lords, King Edward greets you all by me.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Arundel, say your message.
EARL OF ARUNDEL

His majesty, 36
Hearing that you had taken Gaveston,
Entreateth you by me, yet but he may
See him before he dies; for why, he says,
And sends you word, he knows that die he shall; 40
And if you gratify his grace so far,
He will be mindful of the courtesy.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

How now?
GAVESTON

Renownèd Edward, how thy name 44
Revives poor Gaveston!
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

No, it needeth not;
Arundel, we will gratify the king
In other matters; he must pardon us in this. 48
Soldiers, away with him!
GAVESTON

Why, my lord of Warwick,
Will not these delays beget my hopes?
I know it, lords, it is this life you aim at, 52
Yet grant King Edward this.
YOUNG MORTIMER

Shalt thou appoint
What we shall grant? Soldiers, away with him!
Thus we’ll gratify the king: 56
We’ll send his head by thee; let him bestow
His tears on that, for that is all he gets
Of Gaveston, or else his senseless trunk.
LANCASTER

Not so, my lords, lest he bestow more cost 60
In burying him than he hath ever earn’d.
EARL OF ARUNDEL

My lords, it is his majesty’s request,
And in the honour of a king he swears,
He will but talk with him, and send him back. 64
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

When? Can you tell? Arundel, no; we wot
He that the care of his realm remits,
And drives his nobles to these exigents 5
For Gaveston, will, if he sees 6 him once, 68
Violate any promises to possess him.
EARL OF ARUNDEL

Then if you will not trust his grace in keep,
My lords, I will be pledge for his return.
YOUNG MORTIMER

’Tis honourable in thee to offer this; 72
But for we know thou art a noble gentleman,
We will not wrong thee so, to make away
A true man for a thief.
GAVESTON

How mean’st thou, Mortimer? That is over-base. 76
YOUNG MORTIMER

Away, base groom, robber of king’s renown!
Question with thy companions and thy mates.
PEMBROKE

My Lord Mortimer, and you, my lords, each one,
To gratify the king’s request therein, 80
Touching the sending of this Gaveston,
Because his majesty so earnestly
Desires to see the man before his death,
I will upon mine honour undertake 84
To carry him, and bring him back again;
Provided this, that you my lord of Arundel
Will join with me.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Pembroke, what wilt thou do? 88
Cause yet more bloodshed? Is it not enough
That we have taken him, but must we now
Leave him on “had I wist,” and let him go?
PEMBROKE

My lords, I will not over-woo your honours, 92
But if you dare trust Pembroke with the prisoner,
Upon mine oath, I will return him back.
EARL OF ARUNDEL

My lord of Lancaster, what say you in this?
LANCASTER

Why, say, let him go on Pembroke’s word. 96
PEMBROKE

And you, Lord Mortimer?
YOUNG MORTIMER

How say you, my lord of Warwick?
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Nay, do your pleasures, I know how ’twill prove.
PEMBROKE

Then give him me. 100
GAVESTON

Sweet sovereign, yet I come
To see thee ere I die.
GUY, EARL of WARWICK

Yet not perhaps,
If Warwick’s wit and policy prevail. [Aside.] 104
YOUNG MORTIMER

My lord of Pembroke, we deliver him you;
Return him on your honour. Sound, away!
[Exeunt all except PEMBROKE, ARUNDEL, GAVESTON, (JAMES,) and other Attendants of PEMBROKE. ] PEMBROKE

(My lord of Arundel,) you shall go with me.
My house is not far hence; out of the way 108
A little, but our men shall go along.
We that have pretty wenches to our wives,
Sir, must not come so near and baulk their lips.
EARL OF ARUNDEL

’Tis very kindly spoke, my lord of Pembroke; 112
Your honour hath an adamant of power
To draw a prince.
PEMBROKE

So, my lord. Come hither, James:
I do commit this Gaveston to thee, 116
Be thou this night his keeper; in the morning
We will discharge thee of thy charge. Be gone.
GAVESTON

Unhappy Gaveston, whither goest thou now?
[Exit with JAMES and the other Attendants.]

Horse-boy. My lord, we’ll quickly be at Cobham. [Exeunt.] 120
