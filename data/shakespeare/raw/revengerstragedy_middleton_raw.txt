I.i. [Outside Vindici's house]
Enter Vindici [with a skull]; the Duke, Duchess, Lussurioso [his] son, Spurio the bastard, with a train pass over the stage with torchlight.
VINDICI 
Duke, royal lecher, go, gray-hair'd adultery; 
And thou his son, as impious steep'd as he; 
And thou his bastard, true-begot in evil; 
And thou his duchess that will do with [the] devil: 
Four ex'lent characters. Oh, that marrowless age 
Would stuff the hollow bones with damn'd desires, 
And stead of heat kindle infernal fires 
Within the spendthrift veins of a dry duke, 
A parch'd and juiceless luxur! Oh God, one 
That has scarce blood enough to live upon! 
And he to riot it like a son and heir? 
Oh, the thought of that 
Turns my abused heartstrings into fret! 
Thou sallow picture of my poisoned love, 
My study's ornament, thou shell of death, 
Once the bright face of my betrothed lady, 
When life and beauty naturally fill'd out 
These ragged imperfections, 
When two heaven-pointed diamonds were set 
In those unsightly rings: then 'twas a face 
So far beyond the artificial shine 
Of any woman's bought complexion 
That the uprightest man, if such there be, 
That sin but seven times a day, broke custom 
And made up eight with looking after her. 
Oh, she was able to ha' made a usurer's son 
Melt all his patrimony in a kiss, 
And what his father fifty years told 
To have consum'd, and yet his suit been cold! 
But oh, accursed palace! 
Thee, when thou wert apparel'd in thy flesh, 
The old duke poison'd, 
Because thy purer part would not consent 
Unto his palsy-lust, for old men lustful 
Do show like young men angry, eager-violent, 
Outbid like their limited performances. 
Oh, 'ware an old man hot and vicious! 
"Age, as in gold, in lust is covetous." 
Vengeance, thou murder's quit-rent, and whereby 
Thou shouldst thyself tenant to tragedy, 
Oh, keep thy day, hour, minute, I beseech, 
For those thou hast determin'd! Hum: whoe'er knew 
Murder unpaid? Faith, give revenge her due: 
Sh'as kept touch hitherto. Be merry, merry; 
Advance thee, O thou terror to fat folks, 
To have their costly three-pil'd flesh worn of 
As bare as this: for banquets, ease, and laughter 
Can make great men, as greatness goes by clay, 
But wise men little are more great than they.

Enter [his] brother Hippolito.

HIPPOLITO 
Still sighing o'er death's vizard?

VINDICI 
Brother, welcome; 
What comfort bringst thou? How go things at court?

HIPPOLITO 
In silk and silver, brother; never braver.

VINDICI 
Puh, 
Thou play'st upon my meaning. Prithee say, 
Has that bald madam, opportunity, 
Yet thought upon's? Speak, are we happy yet? 
Thy wrongs and mine are for one scabbard fit.

HIPPOLITO 
It may prove happiness.

VINDICI 
What is't may prove? 
Give me to taste.

HIPPOLITO 
Give me your hearing then. 
You know my place at court.

VINDICI 
Ay, the duke's chamber. 
But 'tis a marvel thou'rt not turn'd out yet!

HIPPOLITO 
Faith, I have been shov'd at, but 'twas still my hap 
To hold by th' duchess' skirt. You guess at that; 
Whom such a coat keeps up can ne'er fall flat. 
But to the purpose. 
Last evening predecessor unto this, 
The duke's son warily enquir'd for me, 
Whose pleasure I attended: he began 
By policy to open and unhusk me 
About the time and common rumour; 
But I had so much wit to keep my thoughts 
Up in their built houses, yet afforded him 
An idle satisfaction without danger. 
But the whole aim and scope of his intent 
Ended in this: conjuring me in private 
To seek some strange-digested fellow forth 
Of ill-contented nature, either disgrac'd 
In former times, or by new grooms displac'd 
Since his stepmother's nuptials, such a blood 
A man that were for evil only good; 
To give you the true word, some base-coin'd pander.

VINDICI 
I reach you, for I know his heat is such: 
Were there as many concubines as ladies 
He would not be contain'd, he must fly out. 
I wonder how ill-featur'd, vild-proportion'd 
That one should be, if she were made for woman, 
Whom at the insurrection of his lust 
He would refuse for once. Heart, I think none, 
Next to a skull, tho' more unsound than one: 
Each face he meets he strongly dotes upon.

HIPPOLITO 
Brother, y'ave truly spoke him. 
He knows not you, but I'll swear you know him.

VINDICI 
And therefore I'll put on that knave for once, 
And be a right man then, a man a' th' time, 
For to be honest is not to be i' th' world. 
Brother, I'll be that strange-composed fellow.

HIPPOLITO 
And I'll prefer you, brother.

VINDICI 
Go to then; 
The small'st advantage fattens wronged men, 
It may point out. Occasion, if I meet her, 
I'll hold her by the foretop fast enough, 
Or like the French mole heave up hair and all. 
I have a habit that will fit it quaintly.

[Enter Gratiana and Castiza.]

Here comes our mother.

HIPPOLITO 
And sister.

VINDICI 
We must coin. 
Women are apt, you know, to take false money, 
But I dare stake my soul for these two creatures, 
Only excuse excepted that they'll swallow 
Because their sex is easy in belief.

[GRATIANA] 
What news from [court], son Carlo?

HIPPOLITO 
Faith, Mother, 
'Tis whisper'd there the duchess' youngest son 
Has play'd a rape on Lord Antonio's wife.

[GRATIANA] 
On that religious lady!

CASTIZA 
Royal blood! 
Monster, he deserves to die, 
If Italy had no more hopes but he.

VINDICI 
Sister, y'ave sentenc'd most direct and true: 
The law's a woman, and would she were you. 
Mother, I must take leave of you.

[GRATIANA] 
Leave for what?

VINDICI 
I intend speedy travel.

HIPPOLITO 
That he does, madam.

[GRATIANA] 
Speedy indeed!

VINDICI 
For since my worthy father's funeral, 
My life's unnatural to me, e'en compell'd 
As if I liv'd now when I should be dead.

[GRATIANA] 
Indeed he was a worthy gentleman, 
Had his estate been fellow to his mind.

VINDICI 
The duke did much deject him.

[GRATIANA] 
Much?

VINDICI 
Too much. 
And through disgrace oft smother'd in his spirit 
When it would mount, surely I think he died 
Of discontent, the nobleman's consumption.

[GRATIANA] 
Most sure he did!

VINDICI 
Did he? 'Lack, you know all; 
You were his midnight secretary.

[GRATIANA] 
No. 
He was too wise to trust me with his thoughts.

VINDICI 
I'faith then, father, thou wast wise indeed: 
"Wives are but made to go to bed and feed." 
Come mother, sister; you'll bring me onward, brother?

HIPPOLITO 
I will.

VINDICI 
[Aside to him] I'll quickly turn into another.

Exeunt.


[I.ii. A court of law]
Enter the old Duke, Lussurioso his son, the Duchess, the Bastard, the Duchess' two sons Ambitioso and Supervacuo, the third her youngest brought out with Officers for the rape, two Judges.

DUKE 
Duchess, it is your youngest son; we're sorry. 
His violent act has e'en drawn blood of honour 
And stain'd our honours, 
Thrown ink upon the forehead of our state, 
Which envious spirits will dip their pens into 
After our death and blot us in our tombs, 
For that which would seem treason in our lives 
Is laughter when we're dead: who dares now whisper 
That dares not then speak out, and e'en proclaim, 
With loud words and broad pens our closest shame?

[FIRST] JUDGE 
Your grace hath spoke like to your silver years 
Full of confirmed gravity, for what is it to have 
A flattering false insculption on a tomb, 
And in men's hearts' reproach? The bowell'd corpse 
May be cer'd in, but with free tongue I speak, 
"The faults of great men through their [cerecloths] break."

DUKE 
They do, we're sorry for't; it is our fate: 
To live in fear and die to live in hate. 
I leave him to your sentence; doom him, lords, 
The fact is great, whilst I sit by and sigh.

DUCHESS 
My gracious lord, I pray be merciful. 
Although his trespass far exceed his years, 
Think him to be your own as I am yours; 
Call him not son-in-law. The law I fear 
Will fall too soon upon his name and him; 
Temper his fault with pity.

LUSSURIOSO 
Good my lord, 
Then 'twill not taste so bitter and unpleasant 
Upon the judge's palate, for offenses 
Gilt o'er with mercy show like fairest women, 
Good only for their beauties, which wash'd of, 
No sin is uglier.

AMBITIOSO 
I beseech your grace, 
Be soft and mild: let not relentless law, 
Look with an iron forehead on our brother.

SPURIO 
He yields small comfort yet; hope he shall die, 
And if a bastard's wish might stand in force, 
Would all the court were turn'd into a corse.

DUCHESS 
No pity yet? Must I rise fruitless then? 
A wonder in a woman. Are my knees 
Of such low metal that without respect--

FIRST JUDGE 
Let the offender stand forth. 
'Tis the duke's pleasure that impartial doom 
Shall take [fast] hold of his unclean attempt. 
A rape! Why, 'tis the very core of lust, 
Double adultery!

JUNIOR 
So, sir.

SECOND JUDGE 
And which was worse, 
Committed on the Lord Antonio's wife, 
That general honest lady. Confess, my lord! 
What mov'd you to't?

JUNIOR 
Why, flesh and blood, my lord. 
What should move men unto a woman else?

LUSSURIOSO 
Oh, do not jest thy doom; trust not an axe 
Or sword too far: the law is a wise serpent 
And quickly can beguile thee of thy life. 
Tho' marriage only has [made] thee my brother, 
I love thee so far; play not with thy death.

JUNIOR 
I thank you, troth; good admonitions, faith, 
If I'd the grace now to make use of them.

FIRST JUDGE 
That lady's name has spread such a fair wing 
Over all Italy, that if our tongues 
Were sparing toward the fact, judgment itself 
Would be condemned and suffer in men's thoughts.

JUNIOR 
Well then, 'tis done, and it would please me well 
Were it to do again: sure [she's] a goddess, 
For I'd no power to see her and to live. 
It falls out true in this, for I must die: 
Her beauty was ordain'd to be my scaffold. 
And yet [methinks] I might be easier [cess'd], 
My fault being sport, let me but die in jest.

FIRST JUDGE 
This be the sentence.

DUCHESS 
Oh, keep 't upon your tongue; let it not slip: 
Death too soon steals out of a lawyer's lip. 
Be not so cruel-wise.

FIRST JUDGE 
Your grace must pardon us; 
'Tis but the justice of the law.

DUCHESS 
The law 
Is grown more subtle than a woman should be.

SPURIO 
[Aside] Now, now he dies; rid 'em away.

DUCHESS 
[Aside] Oh, what it is to have an old, cool duke, 
To be as slack in tongue as in performance!

FIRST JUDGE 
Confirm'd; this be the doom irrevocable.

DUCHESS 
Oh!

FIRST JUDGE 
Tomorrow early--

DUCHESS 
Pray be a-bed, my lord.

FIRST JUDGE 
Your grace much wrongs yourself.

AMBITIOSO 
No, 'tis that tongue, 
Your too much right, does do us too much wrong.

FIRST JUDGE 
Let that offender--

DUCHESS 
Live, and be in health.

FIRST JUDGE 
Be on a scaffold--

DUKE 
Hold, hold, my lord.

SPURIO 
[Aside] Pax on't, 
What makes my dad speak now?

DUKE 
We will defer the judgment till next sitting. 
In the meantime let him be kept close prisoner: 
Guard, bear him hence.

[Ambitioso and Supervacuo take Junior aside.]

AMBITIOSO 
Brother, this makes for thee; 
Fear not, we'll have a trick to set thee free.

JUNIOR 
Brother, I will expect it from you both, 
And in that hope I rest.

SUPERVACUO 
Farewell, be merry.

Exit [Junior] with a guard.

SPURIO 
[Aside] Delay'd, deferr'd! Nay, then if judgment have cold blood, 
Flattery and bribes will kill it.

DUKE 
About it then, my lords, with your best powers; 
More serious business calls upon our hours.

Exeunt [omnes]. Manet Duchess.

DUCHESS 
Wast ever known step-duchess was so mild 
And calm as I? Some now would plot his death 
With easy doctors, those loose-living men, 
And make his wither'd grace fall to his grave 
And keep church better. 
Some second wife would do this, and dispatch 
Her double-loath'd lord at meat and sleep. 
Indeed, 'tis true an old man's twice a child. 
Mine cannot speak; one of his single words 
Would quite have freed my youngest, dearest son 
From death or durance, and have made him walk 
With a bold foot upon the thorny law, 
Whose prickles should bow under him: but 'tis not, 
And therefore wedlock, faith, shall be forgot. 
I'll kill him in his forehead; hate there feed: 
That wound is deepest tho' it never bleed.

[Enter Spurio.]

[Aside] And here comes he whom my heart points unto, 
His bastard son, but my love's true-begot. 
Many a wealthy letter have I sent him, 
Swell'd up with jewels, and the timorous man 
Is yet but coldly kind; 
That jewel's mine that quivers in his ear, 
Mocking his master's chillness and vain fear. 
H'as spied me now.

SPURIO 
Madam? Your grace so private? 
My duty on your hand.

[He kisses her hand.]

DUCHESS 
Upon my hand, sir! Troth, I think you'd fear 
To kiss my hand too if my lip stood there.

SPURIO 
Witness I would not, madam.

DUCHESS 
Tis a wonder, 
For ceremony [has] made many fools. 
It is as easy way unto a duchess 
As to a hatted dame, if her love answer, 
But that by timorous honours, pale respects, 
Idle degrees of fear, men make their ways 
Hard of themselves. What have you thought of me?

SPURIO 
Madam, I ever think of you in duty, 
Regard, and--

DUCHESS 
Puh, upon my love, I mean!

SPURIO 
I would 'twere love, but ['t 'as] a fouler name 
Than lust; you are my father's wife: your grace may guess now 
What I could call it.

DUCHESS 
Why, th'art his son but falsely; 
'Tis a hard question whether he begot thee.

SPURIO 
I'faith, 'tis true too; I'm an uncertain man, 
Of more uncertain woman. Maybe his groom 
A' th' stable begot me; you know I know not. 
He could ride a horse well; a shrewd suspicion, marry! 
He was wondrous tall; he had his length, i'faith, 
For peeping over half shut holy-day windows: 
Men would desire him light! When he was afoot, 
He made a goodly show under a penthouse, 
And when he rid, his hat would check the signs 
And clatter barbers' basins.

DUCHESS 
Nay, set you a-horseback once, 
You'll ne'er light off.

SPURIO 
Indeed, I am a beggar.

DUCHESS 
That's more the sign thou art great. But to our love: 
Let it stand firm both in thought and mind. 
That the duke was thy father, as no doubt then 
He bid fair for't, thy injury is the more, 
For had he cut thee a right diamond, 
Thou hadst been next set in the dukedom's ring 
When his worn self like age's easy slave 
Had dropp'd out of the collet into th' grave. 
What wrong can equal this? Canst thou be tame 
And think upon't?

SPURIO 
No, mad and think upon't!

DUCHESS 
Who would not be reveng'd of such a father, 
E'en in the worst way? I would thank that sin 
That could most injury him and be in league with it. 
Oh, what a grief 'tis, that a man should live 
But once i' th' world, and then to live a bastard, 
The curse a' the womb, the thief of nature, 
Begot against the seventh commandment, 
Half-damn'd in the conception, by the justice 
Of that unbribed, everlasting law!

SPURIO 
Oh, I'd a hot-back'd devil to my father!

DUCHESS 
Would not this mad e'en patience, make blood rough? 
Who but an eunuch would not sin, his bed 
By one false minute disinherited?

SPURIO 
Ay, there's the vengeance that my birth was wrapp'd in; 
I'll be reveng'd for all. Now hate begin; 
I'll call foul incest but a venial sin.

DUCHESS 
Cold still? In vain then must a duchess woo?

SPURIO 
Madam, I blush to say what I will do.

DUCHESS 
Thence flew sweet comfort, earnest and farewell.

[She kisses him.]

SPURIO 
Oh, one incestuous kiss picks open hell!

DUCHESS 
[Aside] Faith, now, old duke, my vengeance shall reach high; 
I'll arm thy brow with woman's heraldry.

Exit.

SPURIO 
Duke, thou didst do me wrong, and by thy act 
Adultery is my nature. 
Faith, if the truth were known, I was begot 
After some gluttonous dinner; some stirring dish 
Was my first father. When deep healths went round, 
And ladies' cheeks were painted red with wine, 
Their tongues as short and nimble as their heels, 
Uttering words sweet and thick, and when they [rose] 
Were merrily dispos'd to fall again: 
In such a whisp'ring and withdrawing hour, 
When base male-bawds kept sentinel at stair-head, 
Was I stol'n softly. Oh, damnation met 
The sin of feasts, drunken adultery! 
I feel it swell me; my revenge is just: 
I was begot in impudent wine and lust. 
Stepmother, I consent to thy desires; 
I love thy mischief well, but I hate thee 
And those three cubs, thy sons, wishing confusion, 
Death, and disgrace may be their epitaphs. 
As for my brother, the duke's only son, 
Whose birth is more beholding to report 
Than mine, and yet perhaps as falsely sown-- 
Women must not be trusted with their own-- 
I'll loose my days upon him: hate all I. 
Duke, on thy brow I'll draw my bastardy, 
For indeed a bastard by nature should make cuckolds, 
Because he is the son of a cuckold-maker.

Exit.


[I.iii. The palace]
Enter Vindici and Hippolito, Vindici in disguise [as Piato] to attend Lord Lussurioso, the duke's son.

VINDICI 
What, brother? Am I far enough from myself?

HIPPOLITO 
As if another man had been sent 
Into the world, and none wist how he came.

VINDICI 
It will confirm me bold, the child a' th' court: 
Let blushes dwell i' th' country. Impudence, 
Thou goddess of the palace, [mistress] of [mistresses] 
To whom the costly-perfum'd people pray, 
Strike thou my forehead into dauntless marble, 
Mine eyes to steady sapphires: turn my visage, 
And if I must needs glow, let me blush inward 
That this immodest season may not spy 
That scholar in my cheeks, fool-bashfulness, 
That maid in the old time, whose flush of grace 
Would never suffer her to get good clothes. 
Our maids are wiser and are less asham'd; 
Save grace the bawd I seldom hear grace nam'd!

HIPPOLITO 
Nay, brother, you reach out a' th' verge now.

[Enter Lussurioso.]

'Sfoot, the duke's son! Settle your looks.

VINDICI 
Pray let me not be doubted.

HIPPOLITO 
My lord--

LUSSURIOSO 
Hippolito? Be absent; leave us.

HIPPOLITO 
My lord, after long search, wary inquiries 
And politic siftings, I made choice of yon fellow, 
Whom I guess rare for many deep employments; 
This our age swims within him: and if Time 
Had so much hair, I should take him for Time, 
He is so near kin to this present minute.

LUSSURIOSO 
'Tis enough; 
We thank thee. Yet words are but great men's blanks: 
Gold, tho' it be dumb, does utter the best thanks.

[He gives Hippolito gold.]

HIPPOLITO 
Your plenteous honour; an ex'lent fellow, my lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
So, give us leave.

Exit [Hippolito].

Welcome, be not far off, we must be better acquainted. Push, be bold with us, thy hand!

VINDICI 
With all my heart, i'faith. How dost, sweet musk-cat? 
When shall we lie together?

LUSSURIOSO 
[Aside] Wondrous knave! 
Gather him into boldness? 'Sfoot, the slave's 
Already as familiar as an ague, 
And shakes me at his pleasure!--Friend, I can 
Forget myself in private, but elsewhere, 
I pray do you remember me.

VINDICI 
Oh, very well, sir. 
I conster myself saucy.

LUSSURIOSO 
What hast been? 
Of what profession?

VINDICI 
A bone-setter.

LUSSURIOSO 
A bone-setter!

VINDICI 
A bawd, my lord, 
One that sets bones together.

LUSSURIOSO 
[Aside] Notable bluntness! 
Fit, fit for me, e'en train'd up to my hand.-- 
Thou hast been scrivener to much knavery then?

VINDICI 
Fool to abundance, sir. I have been witness 
To the surrenders of a thousand virgins, 
And not so little; 
I have seen patrimonies wash'd a' pieces, 
Fruit-fields turn'd into bastards, 
And in a world of acres, 
Not so much dust due to the heir 'twas left to 
As would well gravel a petition!

LUSSURIOSO 
[Aside] Fine villain! Troth, I like him wondrously. 
He's e'en shap'd for my purpose.--Then thou know'st 
I' th' world strange lust.

VINDICI 
Oh, Dutch lust! Fulsome lust! 
Drunken procreation, which begets 
So many drunkards! Some father dreads not, gone 
To bed in wine, to slide from the mother 
And cling the daughter-in-law, 
Some uncles are adulterous with their nieces, 
Brothers with brothers' wives. Oh, hour of incest! 
Any kin now next to the rim a' th' sister 
Is man's meat in these days, and in the morning 
When they are up and dress'd, and their mask on, 
Who can perceive this save that eternal eye 
That sees through flesh and all well. If anything be damn'd, 
It will be twelve a' clock at night; that twelve 
Will never 'scape: 
It is the Judas of the hours, wherein 
Honest salvation is betray'd to sin.

LUSSURIOSO 
In troth, it is too; but let this talk glide. 
It is our blood to err, tho' hell gap'd loud: 
Ladies know Lucifer fell, yet still are proud. 
Now, sir. Wert thou as secret as thou'rt subtle, 
And deeply fadom'd into all estates, 
I would embrace thee for a near employment, 
And thou shouldst swell in money, and be able 
To make lame beggars crouch to thee.

VINDICI 
My lord? 
Secret? I ne'er had that disease a' th' mother, 
I praise my father: why are men made close, 
But to keep thoughts in best? I grant you this, 
Tell but some woman a secret overnight, 
Your doctor may find it in the urinal i' th' morning. 
But, my lord--

LUSSURIOSO 
So, thou'rt confirmed in me, 
And thus I enter thee.

VINDICI 
This Indian devil 
Will quickly enter any man but a usurer; 
He prevents that by ent'ring the devil first.

LUSSURIOSO 
Attend me: I am past my [depth] in lust 
And I must swim or drown; all my desires 
Are level'd at a virgin not far from court, 
To whom I have convey'd by messenger 
Many wax'd lines, full of my neatest spirit, 
And jewels that were able to ravish her 
Without the help of man, all which and more 
She, foolish-chaste, sent back, the messengers 
Receiving frowns for answers.

VINDICI 
Possible? 
'Tis a rare phoenix, whoe'er she be, 
If your desires be such, she so repugnant. 
In troth, my lord, I'd be reveng'd and marry her.

LUSSURIOSO 
Push, the dowry of her blood and of her fortunes 
Are both too mean, good enough to be bad withal. 
I'm one of that number can defend 
Marriage is good, yet rather keep a friend. 
Give me my bed by stealth; there's true delight: 
What breeds a loathing in't but night by night?

VINDICI 
A very fine religion!

LUSSURIOSO 
Therefore thus: 
I'll trust thee in the business of my heart 
Because I see thee well experienc'd 
In this luxurious day wherein we breathe. 
Go thou, and with a smooth, enchanting tongue 
Bewitch her ears and cozen her of all grace. 
Enter upon the portion of her soul, 
Her honour, which she calls her chastity, 
And bring it into expense, for honesty 
Is like a stock of money laid to sleep, 
Which ne'er so little broke does never keep.

VINDICI 
You have gi'n 't the tang, i'faith, my lord. 
Make known the lady to me, and my brain 
Shall swell with strange invention: I will move it 
Till I expire with speaking, and drop down 
Without a word to save me; but I'll work.

LUSSURIOSO 
We thank thee, and will raise thee: receive her name; 
It is the only daughter to Madam Gratiana, 
The late widow.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Oh, my sister, my sister!

LUSSURIOSO 
Why dost walk aside?

VINDICI 
My lord, I was thinking how I might begin, 
As thus, "Oh, lady," or twenty hundred devices; 
Her very bodkin will put a man in.

LUSSURIOSO 
Ay, or the wagging of her hair.

VINDICI 
No, that shall put you in, my lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
Shall 't? Why, content. Dost know the daughter then?

VINDICI 
Oh, ex'lent well by sight.

LUSSURIOSO 
That was her brother 
That did prefer thee to us.

VINDICI 
My lord, I think so; 
I knew I had seen him somewhere.

LUSSURIOSO 
And therefore, prithee, let thy heart to him 
Be as a virgin, close.

VINDICI 
Oh, [my] good lord!

LUSSURIOSO 
We may laugh at that simple age within him.

VINDICI 
Ha, ha, ha!

LUSSURIOSO 
Himself being made the subtle instrument 
To wind up a good fellow.

VINDICI 
That's I, my lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
That's thou, 
To entice and work his sister.

VINDICI 
A pure novice!

LUSSURIOSO 
'Twas finely manag'd.

VINDICI 
Gallantly carried. 
[Aside] A pretty, perfum'd villain!

LUSSURIOSO 
I've bethought me, 
If she prove chaste still and immoveable, 
Venture upon the mother, and with gifts 
As I will furnish thee, begin with her.

VINDICI 
Oh, fie, fie, that's the wrong end, my lord! 'Tis mere impossible that a mother by any gifts should become a bawd to her own daughter!

LUSSURIOSO 
Nay, then I see thou'rt but a puny in the subtle mystery of a woman. 
Why, 'tis held now no dainty dish: the name 
Is so in league with age that nowadays 
It does eclipse three quarters of a mother.

VINDICI 
Dost so, my lord? 
Let me alone then to eclipse the fourth.

LUSSURIOSO 
Why, well said; come, I'll furnish thee, but first 
Swear to be true in all.

VINDICI 
True?

LUSSURIOSO 
Nay, but swear!

VINDICI 
Swear? 
I hope your honour little doubts my faith.

LUSSURIOSO 
Yet for my humour's sake, 'cause I love swearing.

VINDICI 
'Cause you love swearing, 'slud, I will.

LUSSURIOSO 
Why, enough, 
Ere long look to be made of better stuff.

VINDICI 
That will do well indeed, my lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
Attend me.

Exit.

VINDICI 
Oh, 
Now let me burst: I've eaten noble poison! 
We are made strange fellows, brother, innocent villains. 
Wilt not be angry when thou hear'st on't, think'st thou? 
I'faith, thou shalt; swear me to foul my sister! 
Sword, I durst make a promise of him to thee, 
Thou shalt dis-heir him, it shall be thine honour! 
And yet now angry froth is down in me, 
It would not prove the meanest policy 
In this disguise to try the faith of both; 
Another might have had the selfsame office, 
Some slave that would have wrought effectually, 
Ay, and perhaps o'erwrought 'em. Therefore I, 
Being thought travell'd, will apply myself 
Unto the selfsame form, forget my nature, 
As if no part about me were kin to 'em; 
So touch 'em, tho' I durst almost for good 
Venture my lands in heaven upon their [blood].

Exit.


[I.iv. Antonio's house]
Enter the discontented Lord Antonio, whose wife the Duchess' youngest son ravish'd, he discovering the body of her dead to [Piero and other] certain Lords and Hippolito.

ANTONIO 
Draw nearer, lords, and be sad witnesses 
Of a fair, comely building newly fall'n, 
Being falsely undermined: violent rape 
Has play'd a glorious act. Behold, my lords, 
A sight that strikes man out of me.

PIERO 
That virtuous lady?

ANTONIO 
President for wives!

HIPPOLITO 
The blush of many women, whose chaste presence 
Would e'en call shame up to their cheeks, 
And make pale wanton sinners have good colours--

ANTONIO 
Dead! 
Her honour first drunk poison, and her life, 
Being fellows in one house, did pledge her honour.

PIERO 
Oh, grief of many!

ANTONIO 
I mark'd not this before. 
A prayer book the pillow to her cheek, 
This was her rich confection, and another 
Plac'd in her right hand, with a leaf tuck'd up, 
Pointing to these words: 
"Melius virtute mori, quam per dedecus vivere." 
True and effectual it is indeed.

HIPPOLITO 
My lord, since you invite us to your sorrows, 
Let's truly taste 'em, that with equal comfort 
As to ourselves we may relieve your wrongs; 
We have grief too that yet walks without tongue: 
Curae leves loquuntur, majores stupent.

ANTONIO 
You deal with truth, my lord. 
Lend me but your attentions, and I'll cut 
Long grief into short words: last revelling night, 
When torch-light made an artificial noon 
About the court, some courtiers in the masque, 
Putting on better faces than their own, 
Being full of fraud and flattery, amongst whom 
The duchess' youngest son, that moth to honour, 
Fill'd up a room, and with long lust to eat 
Into my wearing, amongst all the ladies, 
Singled out that dear form, who ever liv'd 
As cold in lust as she is now in death, 
Which that step-duchess' monster knew too well; 
And therefore in the height of all the revels, 
When music was hard loudest, courtiers busiest, 
And ladies great with laughter. Oh, vicious minute! 
Unfit but for relation to be spoke of! 
Then with a face more impudent than his vizard, 
He harried her amidst a throng of panders, 
That live upon damnation of both kinds, 
And fed the ravenous vulture of his lust! 
Oh, death to think on't! She, her honour forc'd, 
Deem'd it a nobler dowry for her name 
To die with poison than to live with shame.

HIPPOLITO 
A wondrous lady; of rare fire compact: 
Sh'as made her name an empress by that act.

PIERO 
My lord, what judgment follows the offender?

ANTONIO 
Faith, none, my lord: it cools and is deferr'd.

PIERO 
Delay the doom for rape?

ANTONIO 
Oh, you must note who 'tis should die: 
The Duchess' son; she'll look to be a saver. 
"Judgment in this age is ne'er kin to favour."

HIPPOLITO 
[Drawing his sword] Nay, then step forth, thou bribeless officer. 
I bind you all in steel to bind you surely: 
Here let your oaths meet to be kept and paid, 
Which else will stick like rust and shame the blade. 
Strengthen my vow, that if at the next sitting 
Judgment speak all in gold, and spare the blood 
Of such a serpent, e'en before their seats, 
To let his soul out, which long since was found 
Guilty in heaven.

ALL [LORDS] 
We swear it and will act it.

ANTONIO 
Kind gentlemen, I thank you in mine ire.

HIPPOLITO 
'Twere pity 
The ruins of so fair a monument 
Should not be dipp'd in the defacer's blood.

PIERO 
Her funeral shall be wealthy, for her name 
Merits a tomb of pearl. My Lord Antonio, 
For this time wipe your lady from your eyes; 
No doubt our grief and yours may one day court it, 
When we are more familiar with revenge.

ANTONIO 
That is my comfort, gentlemen, and I joy 
In this one happiness above the rest, 
Which will be call'd a miracle at last, 
That being an old man I'd a wife so chaste.

Exeunt.


II.i. [Vindici's house]
Enter Castiza the sister.

CASTIZA 
How hardly shall that maiden be beset 
Whose only fortunes are her constant thoughts, 
That has no other child's part but her honour 
That keeps her low and empty in estate. 
Maids and their honours are like poor beginners: 
Were not sin rich there would be fewer sinners. 
Why had not virtue a revenue? Well, 
I know the cause: 'twould have impoverish'd hell.

Enter Dondolo.

How now, Dondolo?

DONDOLO 
[Madonna], there is one, as they say, a thing of flesh and blood, a man I take him by his beard, that would very desirously mouth to mouth with you.

CASTIZA 
What's that?

DONDOLO 
Show his teeth in your company.

CASTIZA 
I understand thee not.

DONDOLO 
Why, speak with you, Madonna!

CASTIZA 
Why, say so, madman, and cut of a great deal of dirty way. Had it not been better spoke in ordinary words that one would speak with me?

DONDOLO 
Ha, ha, that's as ordinary as two shillings! I would strive a little to show myself in my place: a gentleman usher scorns to use the phrase and fancy of a serving-man.

CASTIZA 
Yours be your [own], sir; go direct him hither.

[Exit Dondolo.]

I hope some happy tidings from my brother 
That lately travell'd, whom my soul affects.

Enter [Vindici] her brother disguised [as Piato].

Here he comes.

VINDICI 
[Giving her a jewel] Lady, the best of wishes to your sex, 
Fair skins and new gowns.

CASTIZA 
Oh, they shall thank you, sir. 
Whence this?

VINDICI 
Oh, from a dear and worthy friend, mighty!

CASTIZA 
From whom?

VINDICI 
The duke's son!

CASTIZA 
Receive that!

A box a' th' ear to her brother.

I swore I'd put anger in my hand 
And pass the virgin limits of myself 
To him that next appear'd in that base office 
To be his sin's attorney; bear to him 
That figure of my hate upon thy cheek 
Whilst 'tis yet hot, and I'll reward thee for't. 
Tell him my honour shall have a rich name 
When several harlots shall share his with shame. 
Farewell; commend me to him in my hate!

Exit.

VINDICI 
It is the sweetest box 
That e'er my nose came nigh, 
The finest drawn-work cuff that e'er was worn. 
I'll love this blow forever, and this cheek 
Shall still hence forward take the wall of this. 
Oh, I'm above my tongue! Most constant sister, 
In this thou hast right honourable shown; 
Many are call'd by their honour that have none. 
Thou art approv'd forever in my thoughts. 
It is not in the power of words to taint thee, 
And yet for the salvation of my oath, 
As my resolve in that point, I will lay 
Hard siege unto my mother, tho' I know 
A siren's tongue could not bewitch her so.

[Enter Gratiana.]

[Aside] Mass, fitly here she comes; thanks, my disguise.-- 
Madam, good afternoon.

[GRATIANA] 
Y'are welcome, sir.

VINDICI 
The next of Italy commends him to you, 
Our mighty expectation, the duke's son.

[GRATIANA] 
I think myself much honour'd that he pleases 
To rank me in his thoughts.

VINDICI 
So may you, lady: 
One that is like to be our sudden duke; 
The crown gapes for him every tide, and then 
Commander o'er us all. Do but think on him; 
How bless'd were they now that could pleasure him 
E'en with anything almost.

[GRATIANA] 
Ay, save their honour.

VINDICI 
Tut, one would let a little of that go too 
And ne'er be seen in't: ne'er be seen [in't], mark you; 
I'd wink and let it go.

[GRATIANA] 
Marry, but I would not.

VINDICI 
Marry, but I would I hope; I know you would too, 
If you'd that blood now which you gave your daughter. 
To her indeed 'tis this wheel comes about: 
That man that must be all this, perhaps ere morning, 
For his white father does but mould away, 
Has long desir'd your daughter.

[GRATIANA] 
Desir'd?

VINDICI 
Nay, but hear me: 
He desires now that will command hereafter. 
Therefore be wise; I speak as more a friend 
To you than him. Madam, I know y'are poor 
And 'lack the day, there are too many poor ladies already: 
Why should you vex the number? 'Tis despis'd. 
Live wealthy, rightly understand the world, 
And chide away that foolish country girl 
Keeps company with your daughter, chastity.

[GRATIANA] 
Oh, fie, fie, 
The riches of the world cannot hire 
A mother to such a most unnatural task!

VINDICI 
No, but a thousand angels can: 
Men have no power; angels must work you to't. 
The world descends into such base-born evils 
That forty angels can make fourscore devils. 
There will be fools still, I perceive, still [fools]. 
Would I be poor, dejected, scorn'd of greatness, 
Swept from the palace, and see other daughters 
Spring with the dew a' th' court, having mine own 
So much desir'd and lov'd by the duke's son? 
No, I would raise my state upon her breast 
And call her eyes my tenants; I would count 
My yearly maintenance upon her cheeks, 
Take coach upon her lip, and all her parts 
Should keep men after men, and I would ride 
In pleasure upon pleasure. 
You took great pains for her, once when it was; 
Let her requite it now, tho' it be but some: 
You brought her forth; she may well bring you home.

[GRATIANA] 
Oh, heavens! This overcomes me.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Not, I hope, already?

[GRATIANA] 
It is too strong for me; men know that know us: 
We are so weak their words can overthrow us. 
He touch'd me nearly, made my virtues bate 
When his tongue struck upon my poor estate.

VINDICI 
[Aside] I e'en quake to proceed; my spirit turns edge. 
I fear me she's unmother'd, yet I'll venture: 
"That woman is all male whom none can enter."-- 
What think you now, lady? Speak, are you wiser? 
What said advancement to you? Thus it said: 
The daughter's fall lifts up the mother's head. 
Did it not, madam? But I'll swear it does 
In many places; tut, this age fears no man: 
"'Tis no shame to be bad, because 'tis common."

[GRATIANA] 
Ay, that's the comfort on't.

VINDICI 
[Aside] The comfort on't!-- 
[Giving her gold] I keep the best for last: can these persuade you 
To forget heaven and--

[GRATIANA] 
Ay, these are they--

VINDICI 
[Aside] Oh!

[GRATIANA] 
That enchant our sex; these are the means 
That govern our affections. That woman 
Will not be troubled with the mother long 
That sees the comfortable shine of you; 
I blush to think what for your sakes I'll do!

VINDICI 
[Aside] Oh, suff'ring heaven, with thy invisible finger 
E'en at this instant turn the precious side 
Of both mine eye-balls inward, not to see myself!

[GRATIANA] 
Look you, sir.

VINDICI 
Holla.

[GRATIANA] 
[Giving him gold] Let this thank your pains.

VINDICI 
Oh, you're a kind [madam].

[GRATIANA] 
I'll see how I can move.

VINDICI 
Your words will sting.

[GRATIANA] 
If she be still chaste I'll ne'er call her mine.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Spoke truer than you meant it.

Enter Castiza.

[GRATIANA] 
Daughter Castiza.

CASTIZA 
Madam.

VINDICI 
Oh, she's yonder. 
Meet her. 
[Aside] Troops of celestial soldiers guard her heart; 
Yon dam has devils enough to take her part.

CASTIZA 
Madam, what makes yon evil-offic'd man 
In presence of you?

[GRATIANA] 
Why?

CASTIZA 
He lately brought 
Immodest writing sent from the duke's son 
To tempt me to dishonourable act.

[GRATIANA] 
Dishonourable act? Good honourable fool, 
That wouldst be honest 'cause thou wouldst be so, 
Producing no one reason but thy will. 
And 't 'as a good report, prettily commended, 
But pray by whom? Mean people, ignorant people; 
The better sort I'm sure cannot abide it. 
And by what rule should we square out our lives 
But by our betters actions? Oh, if thou knew'st 
What 'twere to lose it, thou would never keep it! 
But there's a cold curse laid upon all maids: 
Whilst other[s] clip the sun, they clasp the shades! 
Virginity is paradise, lock'd up. 
You cannot come by yourselves without fee, 
And 'twas decreed that man should keep the key! 
Deny advancement, treasure, the duke's son!

CASTIZA 
I cry you mercy. Lady, I mistook you. 
Pray did you see my mother? Which way went you? 
Pray God I have not lost her.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Prettily put by.

[GRATIANA] 
Are you as proud to me as coy to him? 
Do you not know me now?

CASTIZA 
Why, are you she? 
The world's so chang'd, one shape into another: 
It is a wise child now that knows her mother.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Most right, i'faith.

[GRATIANA] 
I owe your cheek my hand 
For that presumption now, but I'll forget it. 
Come, you shall leave those childish 'haviours 
And understand your time; fortunes flow to you. 
What, will you be a girl? 
If all fear'd drowning that spy waves ashore, 
Gold would grow rich and all the merchants poor.

CASTIZA 
It is a pretty saying of a wicked one, but methinks now 
It does not show so well out of your mouth, 
Better in his.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Faith, bad enough in both, 
Were I in earnest, as I'll seem no less.-- 
I wonder, lady, your own mother's words 
Cannot be taken, nor stand in full force. 
'Tis honesty you urge. What's honesty? 
'Tis but heavens beggar, 
And what woman is so foolish to keep honesty, 
And be not able to keep herself? No, 
Times are grown wiser and will keep less charge: 
A maid that has small portion now intends 
To break up house and live upon her friends. 
How bless'd are you; you have happiness alone: 
Others must fall to thousands, you to one, 
Sufficient in himself to make your forehead 
Dazzle the world with jewels, and petitionary people 
Start at your presence.

[GRATIANA] 
Oh, if I were young, 
I should be ravish'd!

CASTIZA 
Ay, to lose your honour.

VINDICI 
'Slid, how can you lose your honour 
To deal with my lord's grace? 
He'll add more honour to it by his title; 
Your mother will tell you how.

[GRATIANA] 
That I will.

VINDICI 
Oh, think upon the pleasure of the palace: 
Secured ease and state, the stirring meats, 
Ready to move out of the dishes, 
That e'en now quicken when they're eaten, 
Banquets abroad by torch-light, musics, sports, 
Bare-headed vassals that had ne'er the fortune 
To keep on their own hats but let horns [wear] 'em, 
Nine coaches waiting. Hurry, hurry, hurry!

CASTIZA 
Ay, to the devil.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Ay, to the devil!--To th' duke, by my faith.

[GRATIANA] 
Ay, to the duke: daughter, you'd scorn to think 
A' th' devil and you were there once.

VINDICI 
True, for most 
There are as proud as he for his heart, i'faith. 
Who'd sit at home in a neglected room, 
Dealing her short-liv'd beauty to the pictures 
That are as useless as old men, when those 
Poorer in face and fortune than herself 
Walk with a hundred acres on their backs, 
Fair meadows cut into green foreparts? Oh, 
It was the greatest blessing ever happened to women 
When farmers' sons agreed, and met again, 
To wash their hands and come up gentlemen; 
The commonwealth has flourish'd ever since. 
Lands that were [mete] by the rod, that labours spar'd: 
Tailors ride down, and measure 'em by the yard. 
Fair trees, those comely foretops of the field, 
Are cut to maintain head-tires, much untold. 
All thrives but chastity; she lies a-cold. 
Nay, shall I come nearer to you? Mark but this: 
Why are there so few honest women but 
Because 'tis the poorer profession? 
That's accounted best that's best followed: 
Least in trade, least in fashion, 
And that's not honesty. Believe it, and do 
But note the [low] and dejected price of it: 
"Lose but a pearl, we search and cannot brook it, 
But that once gone, who is so mad to look it?"

[GRATIANA] 
Troth, he says true.

CASTIZA 
False! I defy you both! 
I have endur'd you with an ear of fire; 
Your tongues have struck hot irons on my face! 
Mother, come from that poisonous woman there.

[GRATIANA] 
Where?

CASTIZA 
Do you not see her? She's too inward then. 
Slave, perish in thy office! You heavens, please 
Henceforth to make the mother a disease, 
Which first begins with me, yet I've outgone you.

Exit.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Oh angels, clap your wings upon the skies, 
And give this virgin crystal plaudities!

[GRATIANA] 
Peevish, coy, foolish! But return this answer: 
My lord shall be most welcome when his pleasure 
Conducts him this way. I will sway mine own; 
Women with women can work best alone.

VINDICI 
Indeed, I'll tell him so.

Exit.

Oh, more uncivil, more unnatural, 
Than those base-titled creatures that look downward! 
Why does not heaven [turn] black, or with a frown 
Undo the world? Why does not earth start up 
And strike the sins that tread upon't? Oh, 
Wert not gold and women, there would be no damnation; 
Hell would look like a lord's great kitchen without fire in't! 
But 'twas decreed before the world began 
That they should be the hooks to catch at man.

Exit.


[II.ii. The palace]
Enter Lussurioso with Hippolito, Vindici's brother.

LUSSURIOSO 
I much applaud thy judgment; thou art well-read in a fellow, 
And 'tis the deepest art to study man. 
I know this, which I never learnt in schools: 
The world's divided into knaves and fools.

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside] Knave in your face, my lord, behind your back.

LUSSURIOSO 
And I much thank thee that thou hast preferr'd 
A fellow of discourse, well-mingled, 
And whose brain time hath season'd.

HIPPOLITO 
True, my lord. 
[Aside] We shall find season once I hope. Oh, villain, 
To make such an unnatural slave of me! But--

[Enter Vindici, disguised as Piato.]

LUSSURIOSO 
Mass, here he comes.

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside] And now shall I have free leave to depart.

LUSSURIOSO 
Your absence; leave us.

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside] Are not my thoughts true? 
I must remove; but brother, you may stay: 
Heart, we are both made bawds a new-found way!

Exit.

LUSSURIOSO 
Now we're an even number; a third man's dangerous, 
Especially her brother. Say, be free: 
Have I a pleasure toward?

VINDICI 
Oh, my lord!

LUSSURIOSO 
Ravish me in thine answer. Art thou rare? 
Hast thou beguil'd her of salvation, 
And rubb'd hell o'er with honey? Is she a woman?

VINDICI 
In all but in desire.

LUSSURIOSO 
Then she's in nothing; 
I bate in courage now.

VINDICI 
The words I brought, 
Might well have made indifferent-honest naught. 
A right good woman in these days is chang'd 
Into white money with less labour far: 
Many a maid has turn'd to Mahomet 
With easier working. I durst undertake 
Upon the pawn and forfeit of my life 
With half those words to flat a Puritan's wife, 
But she is close and good. Yet 'tis a doubt 
By this time: oh, the mother, the mother!

LUSSURIOSO 
I never thought their sex had been a wonder 
Until this minute. What fruit from the mother?

VINDICI 
[Aside] Now must I blister my soul, be forsworn, 
Or shame the woman that receiv'd me first. 
I will be true; thou liv'st not to proclaim: 
Spoke to a dying man, shame has no shame.-- 
My lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
Who's that?

VINDICI 
Here's none but I, my lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
What would thy haste utter?

VINDICI 
Comfort.

LUSSURIOSO 
Welcome.

VINDICI 
The maid being dull, having no mind to travel 
Into unknown lands, what did me straight 
But set spurs to the mother; golden spurs 
Will put her to a false gallop in a trice.

LUSSURIOSO 
Is't possible that in this 
The mother should be damn'd before the daughter?

VINDICI 
Oh, that's good manners, my lord; the mother 
For her age must go foremost, you know.

LUSSURIOSO 
Thou'st spoke that true! But where comes in this comfort?

VINDICI 
In a fine place, my lord. The unnatural mother 
Did with her tongue so hard beset her honour 
That the poor fool was struck to silent wonder, 
Yet still the maid like an unlighted taper 
Was cold and chaste, save that her mothers breath 
Did blow fire on her [cheeks]; the girl departed, 
But the good, ancient madam half-mad threw me 
These promising words, which I took deeply note of: 
"My lord shall be most welcome"--

LUSSURIOSO 
Faith, I thank her.

VINDICI 
"When his pleasure conducts him this way"--

LUSSURIOSO 
That shall be soon, i'faith.

VINDICI 
"I will sway mine own"--

LUSSURIOSO 
She does the wiser; I commend her for't.

VINDICI 
"Women with women can work best alone."

LUSSURIOSO 
By this light, and so they can. Give 'em their due; 
Men are not comparable to 'em.

VINDICI 
No, 
That's true, for you shall have one woman knit 
More in a hour than any man can ravel 
Again in seven and twenty year.

LUSSURIOSO 
Now my 
Desires are happy, I'll make 'em freemen now. 
Thou art a precious fellow; faith, I love thee. 
Be wise and make it thy revenue: beg, leg! 
What office couldst thou be ambitious for?

VINDICI 
Office, my lord? Marry, if I might have my wish 
I would have one that was never begg'd yet.

LUSSURIOSO 
Nay, then thou canst have none.

VINDICI 
Yes, my lord, 
I could pick out another office yet, 
Nay, and keep a horse and drab upon't.

LUSSURIOSO 
Prithee, good bluntness, tell me.

VINDICI 
Why I would desire but this, 
My lord: to have all the fees behind the arras, 
And all the farthingales that fall plump 
About twelve a' clock at night upon the rushes.

LUSSURIOSO 
Thou'rt a mad, apprehensive knave. 
Dost think to make any great purchase of that?

VINDICI 
Oh, 'tis an unknown thing, 
My lord; I wonder 't 'as been miss'd so long.

LUSSURIOSO 
Well, this night I'll visit her, and 'tis till then 
A year in my desires. Farewell, attend, 
Trust me with thy preferment.

VINDICI 
My lov'd lord!

Exit.

Oh, shall I kill him a' th' wrong side now? No. 
Sword, thou wast never a back-biter yet. 
I'll pierce him to his face; he shall die looking upon me. 
Thy veins are swell'd with lust; this shall unfill 'em: 
Great men were gods if beggars could not kill 'em. 
Forgive me, heaven, to call my mother wicked; 
Oh, lessen not my days upon the earth! 
I cannot honour her; by this I fear me 
Her tongue has turn'd my sister into use. 
I was a villain not to be forsworn 
To this our lecherous hope, the duke's son, 
For lawyers, merchants, some divines and all 
Count beneficial perjury a sin small. 
It shall go hard yet, but I'll guard her honour 
And keep the ports sure.

Enter Hippolito.

HIPPOLITO 
Brother, how goes the world? I would know news of you, 
But I have news to tell you.

VINDICI 
What, in the name of knavery?

HIPPOLITO 
Knavery? Faith, 
This vicious old duke's worthily abus'd: 
The pen of his bastard writes him cuckold!

VINDICI 
His bastard?

HIPPOLITO 
Pray, believe it: he and the duchess 
By night meet in their linen; they have been seen 
By stair-foot panders!

VINDICI 
Oh, sin foul and deep, 
Great faults are wink'd at when the duke's asleep!

[Enter Spurio and his two Servants, one whispering to him.]

See, see, here comes the Spurio.

HIPPOLITO 
Monstrous luxur!

VINDICI 
Unbrac'd, two of his valiant bawds with him. 
Oh, there's a wicked whisper; hell is in his ear! 
Stay, let's observe his passage.

[They retire.]

SPURIO 
Oh, but are you sure on't?

[FIRST] SERVANT 
My lord, most sure on't, for 'twas spoke by one 
That is most inward with the duke's son's lust, 
That he intends within this hour to steal 
Unto Hippolito's sister, whose chaste life 
The mother has corrupted for his use.

SPURIO 
Sweet world, sweet occasion! Faith, then, brother 
I'll disinherit you in as short time, 
As I was when I was begot in haste: 
I'll damn you at your pleasure: precious deed 
After your lust; oh, 'twill be fine to bleed! 
Come, let our passing out be soft and wary.

Exeunt [Spurio and Servants].

VINDICI 
Mark, there, there, that step! Now to the duchess: 
This their second meeting writes the duke cuckold 
With new additions, his horns newly reviv'd. 
Night, thou that lookst like funeral heralds' fees 
Torn down betimes i' th' morning, thou hang'st fitly 
To grace those sins that have no grace at all. 
Now 'tis full sea a-bed over the world; 
There's juggling of all sides. Some that were maids 
E'en at sunset are now perhaps i' th' toll-book: 
This woman in immodest, thin apparel 
Lets in her friend by water; here a dame 
Cunning nails leather hinges to a door, 
To avoid proclamation. 
Now cuckolds are a-coining, apace, apace, apace, apace; 
And careful sisters spin that thread i' th' night 
That does maintain them and their bawds i' th' day!

HIPPOLITO 
You flow well, brother.

VINDICI 
Puh, I'm shallow yet, 
Too sparing and too modest. Shall I tell thee? 
If every trick were told that's dealt by night, 
There are few here that would not blush outright.

HIPPOLITO 
I am of that belief too.

Enter Lussurioso.

VINDICI 
[Aside to Hippolito] Who's this comes? 
The duke's son up so late! Brother, fall back, 
And you shall learn some mischief.--My good lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
Piato! Why, the man I wish'd for. Come, 
I do embrace this season for the fittest 
To taste of that young lady.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Heart and hell!

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside] Damn'd villain!

VINDICI 
[Aside] I ha' no way now to cross it but to kill him.

LUSSURIOSO 
Come, only thou and I.

VINDICI 
My lord, my lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
Why dost thou start us?

VINDICI 
I'd almost forgot: the bastard!

LUSSURIOSO 
What of him?

VINDICI 
This night, this hour, this minute, now!

LUSSURIOSO 
What! What!

VINDICI 
Shadows the duchess--

LUSSURIOSO 
Horrible word.

VINDICI 
And like strong poison eats 
Into the duke your father's forehead.

LUSSURIOSO 
Oh!

VINDICI 
He makes horn royal.

LUSSURIOSO 
Most ignoble slave!

VINDICI 
This is the fruit of two beds.

LUSSURIOSO 
I am mad!

VINDICI 
That passage he trod warily.

LUSSURIOSO 
He did!

VINDICI 
And hush'd his villains every step he took.

LUSSURIOSO 
His villains! I'll confound them!

VINDICI 
Take 'em finely, finely now.

LUSSURIOSO 
The duchess' chamber-door shall not control me.

[Exeunt Lussurioso and Vindici.]

HIPPOLITO 
Good, happy, swift; there's gunpowder i' th' court, 
Wildfire at midnight in this heedless fury. 
He may show violence to cross himself; 
I'll follow the event.

Exit.


[II.iii. The Duke's bedchamber]
[The Duke and Duchess are discovered in bed. Lussurioso and Vindici] enter again [with Hippolito following].

LUSSURIOSO 
Where is that villain?

VINDICI 
Softly, my lord, and you may take 'em twisted.

LUSSURIOSO 
I care not how!

VINDICI 
Oh, 'twill be glorious 
To kill 'em doubled, when they're heap'd! Be soft, my lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
Away! My [spleen] is not so lazy; thus and thus 
I'll shake their eyelids ope, and with my sword 
Shut 'em again forever.

[He draws his sword and approaches the bed.]

Villain, strumpet!

DUKE 
You upper guard defend us!

DUCHESS 
Treason, treason!

DUKE 
Oh, take me not in sleep; I have great sins: I must have days, 
Nay, months, dear son, with penitential heaves 
To lift 'em out and not to die unclear! 
Oh, thou wilt kill me both in heaven and here!

LUSSURIOSO 
I am amaz'd to death.

DUKE 
Nay, villain traitor, 
Worse than the foulest epithet, now I'll gripe thee 
E'en with the nerves of wrath, and throw thy head 
Amongst the lawyer's! Guard!

Enter Nobles and sons [Ambitioso and Supervacuo, with guards].

FIRST NOBLE 
How comes the quiet of your grace disturb'd?

DUKE 
This boy that should be myself after me 
Would be myself before me, and in heat 
Of that ambition bloodily rush'd in 
Intending to depose me in my bed.

SECOND NOBLE 
Duty and natural loyalty forfend!

DUCHESS 
He call'd his father villain and me strumpet, 
A word that I abhor to 'file my lips with.

AMBITIOSO 
That was not so well done, brother.

LUSSURIOSO 
I am abus'd. 
I know there's no excuse can do me good.

VINDICI 
[Aside to Hippolito] 'Tis now good policy to be from sight; 
His vicious purpose to our sister's honour 
Is cross'd beyond our thought.

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside to Vindici] You little dreamt his father slept here.

VINDICI 
[Aside to Hippolito] Oh, 'twas far beyond me. 
But since it fell so-- Without frightful word, 
Would he had kill'd him, 'twould have eas'd our swords.

DUKE 
Be comforted, our duchess: he shall die.

[The Duchess exits as the guards seize Lussurioso. Vindici and Hippolito] dissemble a flight.

LUSSURIOSO 
Where's this slave-pander now? Out of mine eye, 
Guilty of this abuse.

Enter Spurio with his villains [to one side].

SPURIO 
Y'are villains, fablers; 
You have knaves' chins and harlots' tongues: you lie, 
And I will damn you with one meal a day.

FIRST SERVANT 
Oh, good my lord!

SPURIO 
'Sblood, you shall never sup.

SECOND SERVANT 
Oh, I beseech you, sir!

SPURIO 
To let my sword catch cold so long and miss him!

FIRST SERVANT 
Troth, my lord, 'twas his intent to meet there.

SPURIO 
Heart, he's yonder! 
Ha! What news here? Is the day out a' th' socket 
That it is noon at midnight? The court up? 
How comes the guard so saucy with his elbows?

LUSSURIOSO 
The bastard here? 
Nay, then the truth of my intent shall out. 
My lord and father, hear me.

DUKE 
Bear him hence.

LUSSURIOSO 
I can with loyalty excuse.

DUKE 
Excuse? To prison with the villain; 
Death shall not long lag after him.

SPURIO 
[Aside] Good, i'faith, then 'tis not much amiss.

LUSSURIOSO 
[To Ambitioso and Supervacuo aside] Brothers, my best release lies on your tongues; 
I pray persuade for me.

AMBITIOSO 
It is our duties: make yourself sure of us.

SUPERVACUO 
We'll sweat in pleading.

LUSSURIOSO 
And I may live to thank you.

Exeunt [Lussurioso and guards].

AMBITIOSO 
[Aside] No, thy death shall thank me better.

SPURIO 
He's gone: I'll after him 
And know his trespass, seem to bear a part 
In all his ills, but with a puritan heart.

Exit [with Servants].

AMBITIOSO 
[Aside to Supervacuo] Now, brother, let our hate and love be woven 
So subtly together, that in speaking one word for his life, 
We may make three for his death: 
The craftiest pleader gets most gold for breath.

SUPERVACUO 
[Aside to Ambitioso] Set on; I'll not be far behind you, brother.

DUKE 
Is't possible a son 
Should be disobedient as far as the sword? 
It is the highest; he can go no farther.

AMBITIOSO 
My gracious lord, take pity--

DUKE 
Pity, boys?

AMBITIOSO 
Nay, we'd be loath to move your grace too much; 
We know the trespass is unpardonable, 
Black, wicked, and unnatural.

SUPERVACUO 
In a son, oh, monstrous!

AMBITIOSO 
Yet, my lord, 
A duke's soft hand strokes the rough head of law 
And makes it lie smooth.

DUKE 
But my hand shall ne'er do't.

AMBITIOSO 
That as you please, my lord.

SUPERVACUO 
We must needs confess 
Some father would have enter'd into hate, 
So deadly pointed, that before his eyes 
He would ha' seen the execution sound 
Without corrupted favour.

AMBITIOSO 
But, my lord, 
Your grace may live the wonder of all times 
In pard'ning that offence which never yet 
Had face to beg a pardon.

DUKE 
Honey? How's this?

AMBITIOSO 
Forgive him, good my lord: he's your own son, 
And I must needs say 'twas the vildlier done.

SUPERVACUO 
He's the next heir, yet this true reason gathers: 
None can possess that dispossess their fathers. 
Be merciful--

DUKE 
[Aside] Here's no stepmother's wit: 
I'll try 'em both upon their love and hate.

AMBITIOSO 
Be merciful, although--

DUKE 
You have prevail'd: 
My wrath like flaming wax hath spent itself. 
I know 'twas but some peevish moon in him: 
Go, let him be releas'd.

SUPERVACUO 
[Aside to Ambitioso] 'Sfoot, how now, brother?

AMBITIOSO 
Your grace doth please to speak beside your spleen; 
I would it were so happy.

DUKE 
Why, go, release him.

SUPERVACUO 
Oh, my good lord, I know the fault's too weighty 
And full of general loathing, too inhuman, 
Rather by all men's voices worthy death.

DUKE 
'Tis true too. 
Here then, receive this signet; doom shall pass: 
Direct it to the judges; he shall die 
Ere many days. Make haste.

AMBITIOSO 
All speed that may be. 
We could have wish'd his burthen not so sore; 
We knew your grace did but delay before.

Exeunt [Ambitioso and Supervacuo].

DUKE 
Here's envy with a poor, thin cover o'er 't, 
Like scarlet hid in lawn, easily spied through. 
This their ambition by the mother's side 
Is dangerous, and for safety must be purg'd; 
I will prevent their envies. Sure it was 
But some mistaken fury in our son, 
Which these aspiring boys would climb upon: 
He shall be releas'd suddenly.

Enter Nobles. [They kneel.]

FIRST NOBLE 
Good morning to your grace.

DUKE 
Welcome, my lords.

SECOND NOBLE 
Our knees shall take away the office of our feet forever, 
Unless your grace bestow a father's eye 
Upon the clouded fortunes of your son, 
And in compassionate virtue grant him that 
Which makes e'en mean men happy: liberty.

DUKE 
[Aside] How seriously their loves and honours woo 
For that which I am about to pray them do!-- 
Rise, my lords, your knees sign his release: 
We freely pardon him.

FIRST NOBLE 
We owe your grace much thanks, and he much duty.

Exeunt [Nobles].

DUKE 
It well becomes that judge to nod at crimes 
That does commit greater himself and lives. 
I may forgive a disobedient error 
That expect pardon for adultery, 
And in my old days am a youth in lust: 
Many a beauty have I turn'd to poison 
In the denial, covetous of all. 
Age hot is like a monster to be seen: 
My hairs are white, and yet my sins are green.

[Exit.]


III.[i. The palace]
Enter Ambitioso and Supervacuo.

SUPERVACUO 
Brother, let my opinion sway you once, 
I speak it for the best, to have him die 
Surest and soonest; if the signet come 
Unto the judges' hands, why, then his doom 
Will be deferr'd till sittings and court-days, 
Juries and further. Faiths are bought and sold; 
Oaths in these days are but the skin of gold.

AMBITIOSO 
In troth, 'tis true too!

SUPERVACUO 
Then let's set by the judges 
And fall to the officers; 'tis but mistaking 
The duke our father's meaning, and where he nam'd 
"Ere many days," 'tis but forgetting that 
And have him die i' th' morning.

AMBITIOSO 
Excellent; 
Then am I heir, duke in a minute.

SUPERVACUO 
[Aside] Nay, 
And he were once puff'd out, here is a pin 
Should quickly prick your bladder.

AMBITIOSO 
[Bless'd] occasion! 
He being pack'd, we'll have some trick and wile 
To wind our younger brother out of prison 
That lies in for the rape; the lady's dead, 
And people's thoughts will soon be buried.

SUPERVACUO 
We may with safety do't, and live and feed; 
The duchess' sons are too proud to bleed.

AMBITIOSO 
We are, i'faith, to say true. Come, let's not linger. 
I'll to the officers; go you before 
And set an edge upon the executioner.

SUPERVACUO 
Let me alone to grind him.

AMBITIOSO 
Meet; farewell.

Exit [Supervacuo].

I am next now; I rise just in that place 
Where thou'rt cut off: upon thy neck, kind brother. 
The falling of one head lifts up another.

Exit.


[III.ii. Outside the prison]
Enter with the Nobles, Lussurioso from prison.

LUSSURIOSO 
My lords, I am so much indebted to your loves 
For this, oh, this delivery!

FIRST NOBLE 
But our duties, 
My lord, unto the hopes that grow in you.

LUSSURIOSO 
If e'er I live to be myself, I'll thank you. 
Oh liberty, thou sweet and heavenly dame! 
But hell for prison is too mild a name.

Exeunt.


[III.iii. The prison]
Enter Ambitioso and Supervacuo, with Officers.

AMBITIOSO 
Officers, here's the duke's signet, your firm warrant, 
Brings the command of present death along with it 
Unto our brother, the duke's son; we are sorry 
That we are so unnaturally employ'd 
In such an unkind office, fitter far 
For enemies than brothers.

SUPERVACUO 
But you know, 
The duke's command must be obey'd.

FIRST OFFICER 
It must and shall my lord; this morning then. 
So suddenly?

AMBITIOSO 
Ay, alas, poor good soul, 
He must breakfast betimes; the executioner 
Stands ready to put forth his cowardly valour.

SECOND OFFICER 
Already?

SUPERVACUO 
Already, i'faith. Oh, sir, destruction hies, 
And that is least impudent soonest dies.

FIRST OFFICER 
Troth, you say true, my lord. We take our leaves; 
Our office shall be sound: we'll not delay 
The third part of a minute.

AMBITIOSO 
Therein you show 
Yourselves good men and upright officers. 
Pray let him die as private as he may; 
Do him that favour, for the gaping people 
Will but trouble him at his prayers 
And make him curse and swear, and so die black. 
Will you be so far kind?

FIRST OFFICER 
It shall be done, my lord.

AMBITIOSO 
Why, we do thank you; if we live to be, 
You shall have a better office.

SECOND OFFICER 
Your good lordship.

SUPERVACUO 
Commend us to the scaffold in our tears.

FIRST OFFICER 
We'll weep and do your commendations.

Exeunt [Officers].

AMBITIOSO 
Fine fools in office!

SUPERVACUO 
Things fall out so fit.

AMBITIOSO 
So happily! Come, brother, ere next clock 
His head will be made serve a bigger block.

Exeunt.


[III.iv. Junior brother's cell in the prison]
Enter in prison Junior brother.

JUNIOR 
Keeper.

[Enter the Keeper.]

KEEPER 
My lord.

JUNIOR 
No news lately from our brothers? 
Are they unmindful of us?

KEEPER 
My lord, a messenger came newly in 
And brought this from 'em.

[He hands him a letter.]

JUNIOR 
Nothing but paper comforts? 
I look'd for my delivery before this 
Had they been worth their oaths. Prithee be from us.

[Exit the Keeper.]

Now what say you, forsooth? Speak out, I pray.

[Opens and reads the] letter.

"Brother be of good cheer." 
'Slud, it begins like a whore with good cheer! 
"Thou shalt not be long a prisoner." 
Not five and thirty year like a bankrout, I think so. 
"We have thought upon a device to get thee out by a trick." 
By a trick! Pox a' your trick and it be so long a-playing! 
"And so rest comforted, be merry and expect it suddenly." 
Be merry, hang merry, draw and quarter merry, I'll be mad! 
Is't not strange that a man should lie in a whole month for a woman? Well, we shall see how sudden our brothers will be in their promise. I must expect still a trick! I shall not be long a prisoner!

[Enter the Keeper with four Officers.]

How now, what news?

KEEPER 
Bad news, my lord; I am discharg'd of you.

JUNIOR 
Slave, call'st thou that bad news? I thank you, brothers!

KEEPER 
My lord, 'twill prove so; here come the officers 
Into whose hands I must commit you.

JUNIOR 
Ha, officers? What, why?

FIRST OFFICER 
You must pardon us, my lord; 
Our office must be sound: here is our warrant, 
The signet from the duke; you must straight suffer.

JUNIOR 
Suffer? I'll suffer you to be gone, I'll suffer you 
To come no more! What would you have me suffer?

SECOND OFFICER 
My lord, those words were better chang'd to prayers; 
The time's but brief with you: prepare to die.

JUNIOR 
Sure 'tis not so.

THIRD OFFICER 
It is too true, my lord.

JUNIOR 
I tell you 'tis not, for the duke my father 
Deferr'd me till next sitting, and I look 
E'en every minute, threescore times an hour, 
For a release, a trick wrought by my brothers.

FIRST OFFICER 
A trick, my lord? If you expect such comfort, 
Your hopes as fruitless as a barren woman: 
Your brothers were the unhappy messengers 
That brought this powerful token for your death.

JUNIOR 
My brothers? No, no!

SECOND OFFICER 
'Tis most true, my lord.

JUNIOR 
My brothers to bring a warrant for my death? 
How strange this shows!

THIRD OFFICER 
There's no delaying time.

JUNIOR 
Desire 'em hither, call 'em up, my brothers! 
They shall deny it to your faces.

FIRST OFFICER 
My lord, 
They're far enough by this, at least at court, 
And this most strict command they left behind 'em, 
When grief swum in their eyes: they show'd like brothers, 
Brimful of heavy sorrow; but the duke 
Must have his pleasure.

JUNIOR 
His pleasure?

FIRST OFFICER 
These were their last words which my memory bears: 
"Commend us to the scaffold in our tears."

JUNIOR 
Pox dry their tears! What should I do with tears? 
I hate 'em worse than any citizen's son 
Can hate salt water. Here came a letter now, 
New-bleeding from their pens, scarce stinted yet; 
Would I'd been torn in pieces when I tore it. 
Look, you officious whoresons, words of comfort: 
"Not long a prisoner."

FIRST OFFICER 
It says true in that, sir, for you must suffer presently.

JUNIOR 
A villainous duns upon the letter! Knavish exposition! Look you then here, sir: "we'll get thee out by a trick," says he.

SECOND OFFICER 
That may hold too, sir, for you know a trick is commonly four cards, which was meant by us four officers.

JUNIOR 
Worse and worse dealing!

FIRST OFFICER 
The hour beckons us. 
The heads-man waits; lift up your eyes to heaven.

JUNIOR 
I thank you, faith; good, pretty, wholesome counsel. 
I should look up to heaven, as you said, 
Whilst he behind me cozens me of my head; 
Ay, that's the trick.

THIRD OFFICER 
You delay too long, my lord.

JUNIOR 
Stay, good authority's bastards, since I must 
Through brothers' perjury die, oh, let me venom 
Their souls with curses!

FIRST OFFICER 
Come, 'tis no time to curse.

JUNIOR 
Must I bleed then without respect of sign? Well, 
My fault was sweet sport, which the world approves; 
I die for that which every woman loves.

Exeunt.


[III.v. A lodge]
Enter Vindici with Hippolito his brother.

VINDICI 
Oh, sweet, delectable, rare, happy, ravishing!

HIPPOLITO 
Why, what's the matter, brother?

VINDICI 
Oh, 'tis able 
To make a man spring up and knock his forehead 
Against yon silver ceiling!

HIPPOLITO 
Prithee tell me. 
Why, may not I partake with you? You vow'd once 
To give me share to every tragic thought.

VINDICI 
By th' mass, I think I did too. 
Then I'll divide it to thee: the old duke 
Thinking my outward shape and inward heart 
Are cut out of one piece--for he that prates his secrets, 
His heart stands a' th' outside--hires me by price 
To greet him with a lady 
In some fit place veil'd from the eyes a' th' court, 
Some dark'ned, blushless angle, that is guilty 
Of his forefathers' lusts and great-folks' riots, 
To which I easily, to maintain my shape, 
Consented, and did wish his impudent grace 
To meet her here in this unsunned lodge, 
Wherein 'tis night at noon, and here the rather, 
Because unto the torturing of his soul 
The bastard and the duchess have appointed 
Their meeting too in this luxurious circle, 
Which most afflicting sight will kill his eyes 
Before we kill the rest of him.

HIPPOLITO 
'Twill, i'faith, most dreadfully digested. 
I see not how you could have miss'd me, brother.

VINDICI 
True, but the violence of my joy forgot it.

HIPPOLITO 
Ay, but where's that lady now?

VINDICI 
Oh, at that word 
I'm lost again; you cannot find me yet: 
I'm in a throng of happy apprehensions! 
He's suited for a lady; I have took care 
For a delicious lip, a sparkling eye: 
You shall be witness brother. 
Be ready; stand with your hat off.

Exit.

HIPPOLITO 
Troth, I wonder what lady it should be? 
Yet 'tis no wonder, now I think again, 
To have a lady stoop to a duke that stoops unto his men. 
'Tis common to be common through the world: 
And there's more private common shadowing vices 
Than those who are known both by their names and prices. 
[Taking off his hat] 'Tis part of my allegiance to stand bare 
To the duke's concubine, and here she comes.

Enter [Vindici] with the skull of his love dress'd up in tires.

VINDICI 
Madam, his grace will not be absent long. 
Secret? Ne'er doubt us, madam; 'twill be worth 
Three velvet gowns to your ladyship. Known? 
Few ladies respect that. Disgrace? A poor, thin shell; 
'Tis the best grace you have to do it well. 
I'll save your hand that labour; I'll unmask you.

[Draws back the tires.]

HIPPOLITO 
Why, brother, brother!

VINDICI 
Art thou beguil'd now? Tut, a lady can 
At such, all hid, beguile a wiser man. 
Have I not fitted the old surfeiter 
With a quaint piece of beauty? Age and bare bone 
Are e'er allied in action: here's an eye 
Able to tempt a great man to serve God, 
A pretty, hanging lip that has forgot now to dissemble; 
Methinks this mouth should make a swearer tremble, 
A drunkard clasp his teeth and not undo 'em 
To suffer wet damnation to run through 'em. 
Here's a cheek keeps her colour, let the wind go whistle: 
Spout rain, we fear thee not; be hot or cold 
Alls one with us. And is not he absurd 
Whose fortunes are upon their faces set, 
That fear no other God but wind and wet?

HIPPOLITO 
Brother, y'ave spoke that right. 
Is this the form that living shone so bright?

VINDICI 
The very same; 
And now methinks I [could] e'en chide myself 
For doting on her beauty, tho' her death 
Shall be reveng'd after no common action. 
Does the silkworm expend her yellow labours 
For thee? For thee does she undo herself? 
Are lordships sold to maintain ladyships 
For the poor benefit of a bewitching minute? 
Why does yon fellow falsify highways 
And put his life between the judge's lips 
To refine such a thing, keeps horse and men 
To beat their valours for her? 
Surely we're all mad people, and they 
Whom we think are, are not; we mistake those: 
'Tis we are mad in sense, they but in clothes.

HIPPOLITO 
Faith, and in clothes too we; give us our due.

VINDICI 
Does every proud and self-affecting dame 
Camphor her face for this, and grieve her maker 
In sinful baths of milk, when many an infant starves, 
For her superfluous outside fall for this? 
Who now bids twenty pound a-night, prepares 
Music, perfumes, and sweetmeats? All are hush'd; 
Thou mayst lie chaste now! It were fine, methinks, 
To have thee seen at revels, forgetful feasts, 
And unclean brothels; sure 'twould fright the sinner 
And make him a good coward, put a reveller 
Out of his antic amble, 
And cloy an epicure with empty dishes. 
Here might a scornful and ambitious woman 
Look through and through herself; see, ladies, with false forms 
You deceive men but cannot deceive worms. 
Now to my tragic business. Look you, brother, 
I have not fashion'd this only for show 
And useless property; no, it shall bear a part 
E'en in [its] own revenge.

[Applies poison to the skull's mouth.]

This very skull, 
Whose mistress the duke poisoned, with this drug, 
The mortal curse of the earth, shall be reveng'd 
In the like strain, and kiss his lips to death. 
As much as the dumb thing can, he shall feel: 
What fails in poison, we'll supply in steel.

HIPPOLITO 
Brother, I do applaud thy constant vengeance, 
The quaintness of thy malice above thought.

VINDICI 
So 'tis laid on. Now come and welcome, duke; 
I have her for thee. I protest it, brother: 
Methinks she makes almost as fair a sign 
As some old gentlewoman in a periwig. 
Hide thy face now for shame; thou hadst need have a mask now: 
'Tis vain when beauty flows, but when it fleets, 
This would become graves better than the streets.

HIPPOLITO 
You have my voice in that. Hark, the duke's come!

VINDICI 
Peace, let's observe what company he brings, 
And how he does absent 'em, for you know 
He'll wish all private: brother, fall you back a little 
With the bony lady.

HIPPOLITO 
That I will.

VINDICI 
So, so: now nine years' vengeance crowd into a minute!

[Enter the Duke talking to his Gentlemen.]

DUKE 
You shall have leave to leave us, with this charge: 
Upon your lives, if we be miss'd by th' duchess 
Or any of the nobles, to give out 
We're privately rid forth.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Oh, happiness!

DUKE 
With some few honourable gentlemen, you may say; 
You may name those that are away from court.

[FIRST] GENTLEMAN 
Your will and pleasure shall be done, my lord.

[Exeunt the Gentlemen.]

VINDICI 
[Aside] Privately rid forth! 
He strives to make sure work on't.--Your good grace?

DUKE 
Piato, well done. Hast brought her? What lady is't?

VINDICI 
Faith, my lord, a country lady, a little bashful at first, as most of them are, but after the first kiss, my lord, the worst is past with them. Your grace knows now what you have to do; sh'as somewhat a grave look with her, but--

DUKE 
I love that best: conduct her.

VINDICI 
Have at all.

DUKE 
In gravest looks the greatest faults seem less; 
Give me that sin that's rob'd in holiness.

VINDICI 
[Aside to Hippolito] Back with the torch; brother, raise the perfumes.

DUKE 
How sweet can a duke [breathe]? Age has no fault; 
Pleasure should meet in a perfumed mist. 
Lady, sweetly encount'red. I came from court: 
I must be bold with you--

[Kisses the skull.]

Oh, what's this? Oh!

VINDICI 
Royal villain, white devil!

DUKE 
Oh!

VINDICI 
Brother, 
Place the torch here, that his affrighted eyeballs 
May start into those hollows. Duke, dost know 
Yon dreadful vizard? View it well: 'tis the skull 
Of Gloriana, whom thou poisoned'st last.

DUKE 
Oh, 't 'as poisoned me!

VINDICI 
Didst not know that till now?

DUKE 
What are you two?

VINDICI 
Villains all three! The very ragged bone 
Has been sufficiently reveng'd!

DUKE 
Oh, Hippolito? Call treason!

HIPPOLITO stamping on him 
Yes, my good lord: treason, treason, treason!

DUKE 
Then I'm betray'd!

VINDICI 
Alas, poor lecher in the hands of knaves: 
A slavish duke is baser than his slaves.

DUKE 
My teeth are eaten out!

VINDICI 
Hadst any left?

HIPPOLITO 
I think but few.

VINDICI 
Then those that did eat are eaten.

DUKE 
Oh, my tongue!

VINDICI 
Your tongue? 'Twill teach you to kiss closer, 
Not like a [slobbering] Dutchman! You have eyes still: 
Look, monster, what a lady hast thou made me, 
My once betrothed wife!

DUKE 
Is it thou, villain? Nay, then--

VINDICI 
'Tis I, 'tis Vindici, 'tis I!

HIPPOLITO 
And let this comfort thee: our lord and father 
Fell sick upon the infection of thy frowns 
And died in sadness; be that thy hope of life!

DUKE 
Oh!

VINDICI 
He had his tongue, yet grief made him die speechless. 
Puh, 'tis but early yet; now I'll begin 
To stick thy soul with ulcers, I will make 
Thy spirit grievous sore: it shall not rest, 
But like some pestilent man toss in thy breast. Mark me, duke, 
Thou'rt a renowned, high, and mighty cuckold.

DUKE 
Oh!

VINDICI 
Thy bastard, thy bastard rides a-hunting in thy brow.

DUKE 
Millions of deaths!

VINDICI 
Nay, to afflict thee more, 
Here in this lodge they meet for damned clips; 
Those eyes shall see the incest of their lips.

DUKE 
Is there a hell besides this, villains?

VINDICI 
Villain? 
Nay, heaven is just: scorns are the hires of scorns; 
I ne'er knew yet adulterer without horns.

HIPPOLITO 
Once ere they die 'tis quitted.

[Music within.]

VINDICI 
Hark, the music! 
Their banquet is prepar'd; they're coming.

DUKE 
Oh, kill me not with that sight!

VINDICI 
Thou shalt not lose that sight for all thy dukedom.

DUKE 
Traitors, murderers!

VINDICI 
What? Is not thy tongue eaten out yet? 
Then we'll invent a silence. Brother, stifle the torch.

DUKE 
Treason, murther!

VINDICI 
Nay, faith, we'll have you hush'd now with thy dagger. 
Nail down his tongue, and mine shall keep possession 
About his heart: if he but gasp he dies; 
We dread not death to quittance injuries. Brother, 
If he but wink, not brooking the foul object, 
Let our two other hands tear up his lids, 
And make his eyes like comets shine through blood; 
When the bad bleeds, then is the tragedy good.

HIPPOLITO 
Whist, brother: music's at our ear, they come.

Enter [Spurio] the bastard meeting the Duchess. [They kiss.]

SPURIO 
Had not that kiss a taste of sin, 'twere sweet.

DUCHESS 
Why, there's no pleasure sweet but it is sinful.

SPURIO 
True, such a bitter sweetness fate hath given; 
Best side to us is the worst side to heaven.

DUCHESS 
Push, come: 'tis the old duke thy doubtful father; 
The thought of him rubs heaven in thy way, 
But I protest by yonder waxen fire, 
Forget him or I'll poison him.

SPURIO 
Madam, you urge a thought which ne'er had life. 
So deadly do I loathe him for my birth, 
That if he took me hasp'd within his bed, 
I would add murther to adultery, 
And with my sword give up his years to death.

DUCHESS 
Why, now thou'rt sociable! Let's in and feast. 
Loud'st music sound: pleasure is banquet's guest.

[Loud music.] Exeunt.

DUKE 
I cannot brook--

[Vindici stabs the Duke, who dies.]

VINDICI 
The brook is turn'd to blood.

HIPPOLITO 
Thanks to loud music.

VINDICI 
'Twas our friend indeed: 
'Tis state in music for a duke to bleed. 
The dukedom wants a head, tho' yet unknown; 
As fast as they peep up, let's cut 'em down.

Exeunt.


[III.vi. The prison]
Enter the Duchess' two sons, Ambitioso and Supervacuo.

AMBITIOSO 
Was not this execution rarely plotted? 
We are the duke's sons now.

SUPERVACUO 
Ay, you may thank my policy for that.

AMBITIOSO 
Your policy for what?

SUPERVACUO 
Why, was 't not my invention, brother, 
To slip the judges, and in lesser compass, 
Did not I draw the model of his death, 
Advising you to sudden officers 
And e'en extemporal execution?

AMBITIOSO 
Heart, 'twas a thing I thought on too.

SUPERVACUO 
You thought on't too! 'Sfoot, slander not your thoughts 
With glorious untruth! I know 'twas from you.

AMBITIOSO 
Sir, I say 'twas in my head.

[SUPERVACUO] 
Ay, like your brains then, 
Ne'er to come out as long as you liv'd.

AMBITIOSO 
You'd have the honour on't, forsooth, that your wit 
Led him to the scaffold.

SUPERVACUO 
Since it is my due, 
I'll publish 't, but I'll ha't in spite of you.

AMBITIOSO 
Methinks y'are much too bold; you should a little 
Remember us, brother, next to be honest duke.

SUPERVACUO 
Ay, it shall be as easy for you to be duke 
As to be honest, and that's never, i'faith.

AMBITIOSO 
Well, cold he is by this time, and because 
We're both ambitious, be it our amity, 
And let the glory be shar'd equally.

SUPERVACUO 
I am content to that.

AMBITIOSO 
This night our younger brother shall out of prison; 
I have a trick.

SUPERVACUO 
A trick? Prithee, what is't?

AMBITIOSO 
We'll get him out by a wile.

SUPERVACUO 
Prithee, what wile?

AMBITIOSO 
No, sir, you shall not know it till 't be done, 
For then you'd swear 'twere yours.

[Enter an Officer, holding a severed head.]

SUPERVACUO 
How now, what's he?

AMBITIOSO 
One of the officers.

SUPERVACUO 
Desired news.

AMBITIOSO 
How now, my friend?

OFFICER 
My lords, under your pardon, I am allotted 
To that desertless office, to present you 
With the yet bleeding head.

SUPERVACUO 
[Aside to Ambitioso] Ha, ha, excellent!

AMBITIOSO 
[Aside to Supervacuo] All's sure our own: brother, canst weep, think,st thou? 
'Twould grace our flattery much; think of some dame: 
'Twill teach thee to dissemble.

SUPERVACUO 
[Aside to Ambitioso] I have thought; 
Now for yourself.

AMBITIOSO 
Our sorrows are so fluent, 
Our eyes o'erflow our tongues; words spoke in tears 
Are like the murmurs of the waters; the sound 
Is loudly heard, but cannot be distinguish'd.

SUPERVACUO 
How died he, pray?

OFFICER 
Oh, full of rage and spleen!

SUPERVACUO 
He died most valiantly then; we're glad to hear it.

OFFICER 
We could not woo him once to pray.

AMBITIOSO 
He show'd himself a gentleman in that: 
Give him his due.

OFFICER 
But in the stead of prayer, 
He drew forth oaths.

SUPERVACUO 
Then did he pray, dear heart, 
Although you understood him not.

OFFICER 
My lords, 
E'en at his last, with pardon be it spoke, 
He curs'd you both.

SUPERVACUO 
He curs'd us? 'Las, good soul!

AMBITIOSO 
It was not in our powers, but the duke's pleasure. 
[Aside to Supervacuo] Finely dissembled a' both sides. Sweet fate, 
Oh, happy opportunity!

Enter Lussurioso.

LUSSURIOSO 
Now, my lords.

[AMBITIOSO, SUPERVACUO] 
Oh!

LUSSURIOSO 
Why do you shun me, brothers? 
You may come nearer now; 
The savour of the prison has forsook me. 
I thank such kind lords as yourselves, I'm free.

AMBITIOSO 
Alive!

SUPERVACUO 
In health!

AMBITIOSO 
Releas'd! 
We were both e'en amaz'd with joy to see it.

LUSSURIOSO 
I am much to thank you.

SUPERVACUO 
Faith, we spar'd no tongue unto my lord the duke.

AMBITIOSO 
I know your delivery, brother, 
Had not been half so sudden but for us.

SUPERVACUO 
Oh, how we pleaded!

LUSSURIOSO 
Most deserving brothers, 
In my best studies I will think of it.

Exit Lussurioso.

AMBITIOSO 
Oh, death and vengeance!

SUPERVACUO 
Hell and torments!

AMBITIOSO 
Slave, cam'st thou to delude us?

OFFICER 
Delude you, my lords?

SUPERVACUO 
Ay, villain, where's this head now?

OFFICER 
Why, here, my lord. 
Just after his delivery, you both came 
With warrant from the duke to behead your brother.

AMBITIOSO 
Ay, our brother, the duke's son.

OFFICER 
The duke's son, 
My lord, had his release before you came.

AMBITIOSO 
Whose head's that then?

OFFICER 
His whom you left command for, your own brother's.

AMBITIOSO 
Our brother's? Oh, furies!

SUPERVACUO 
Plagues!

AMBITIOSO 
Confusions!

SUPERVACUO 
Darkness!

AMBITIOSO 
Devils!

SUPERVACUO 
Fell it out so accursedly?

AMBITIOSO 
So damnedly?

SUPERVACUO 
Villain, I'll brain thee with it!

OFFICER 
Oh, my good lord!

[Exit Officer, running.]

SUPERVACUO 
The devil overtake thee!

AMBITIOSO 
Oh, fatal!

SUPERVACUO 
Oh, prodigious to our bloods!

AMBITIOSO 
Did we dissemble?

SUPERVACUO 
Did we make our tears women for thee?

AMBITIOSO 
Laugh and rejoice for thee?

SUPERVACUO 
Bring warrant for thy death?

AMBITIOSO 
Mock off thy head?

SUPERVACUO 
You had a trick, you had a wile, forsooth!

AMBITIOSO 
A murrain meet 'em! There's none of these wiles 
That ever come to good: I see now 
There is nothing sure in mortality but mortality. 
Well, no more words; shalt be reveng'd, i'faith. 
Come, throw off clouds now, brother, think of vengeance 
And deeper-settled hate. Sirrah, sit fast: 
We'll pull down all, but thou shalt down at last.

Exeunt.


IV.i. [The palace]
Enter Lussurioso with Hippolito.

LUSSURIOSO 
Hippolito.

HIPPOLITO 
My lord, has your good lordship 
Ought to command me in?

LUSSURIOSO 
I prithee leave us.

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside] How's this? Come and leave us?

LUSSURIOSO 
Hippolito.

HIPPOLITO 
Your honour, 
I stand ready for any duteous employment.

LUSSURIOSO 
Heart, what mak'st thou here?

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside] A pretty, lordly humour: 
He bids me to be present, to depart; 
Something has stung his honour.

LUSSURIOSO 
Be nearer, draw nearer: 
Ye are not so good, methinks; I'm angry with you.

HIPPOLITO 
With me, my lord? I'm angry with myself for't.

LUSSURIOSO 
You did prefer a goodly fellow to me. 
'Twas wittily elected, 'twas; I thought 
H'ad been a villain, and he proves a knave, 
To me a knave.

HIPPOLITO 
I chose him for the best, my lord. 
'Tis much my sorrow if neglect in him, 
Breed discontent in you.

LUSSURIOSO 
Neglect? 'Twas will! Judge of it: 
Firmly to tell of an incredible act, 
Not to be thought, less to be spoken of, 
'Twixt my stepmother and the bastard, oh, 
Incestuous sweets between 'em!

HIPPOLITO 
Fie, my lord!

LUSSURIOSO 
I, in kind loyalty to my father's forehead, 
Made this a desperate arm, and in that fury 
Committed treason on the lawful bed, 
And with my sword e'en [ras'd] my father's bosom, 
For which I was within a stroke of death.

HIPPOLITO 
Alack, I'm sorry.

Enter Vindici [disguised as Piato].

[Aside] 'Sfoot, just upon the stroke 
Jars in my brother; 'twill be villainous music.

VINDICI 
My honoured lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
Away! Prithee forsake us; 
Hereafter we'll not know thee.

VINDICI 
Not know me, my lord? Your lordship cannot choose.

LUSSURIOSO 
Be gone, I say: thou art a false knave.

VINDICI 
Why, the easier to be known, my lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
Push, I shall prove too bitter with a word, 
Make thee a perpetual prisoner, 
And lay this ironage upon thee!

VINDICI 
Mum, 
For there's a doom would make a woman dumb. 
[Aside] Missing the bastard, next him, the wind's come about; 
Now 'tis my brother's turn to stay, mine to go out.

Exit Vindici.

LUSSURIOSO 
H'as greatly mov'd me.

HIPPOLITO 
Much to blame, i'faith.

LUSSURIOSO 
But I'll recover to his ruin: 'twas told me lately, 
I know not whether falsely, that you'd a brother.

HIPPOLITO 
Who I? Yes, my good lord, I have a brother.

LUSSURIOSO 
How chance the court ne'er saw him? Of what nature? 
How does he apply his hours?

HIPPOLITO 
Faith, to curse fates, 
Who, as he thinks, ordain'd him to be poor, 
Keeps at home full of want and discontent.

LUSSURIOSO 
There's hope in him, for discontent and want 
Is the best clay to mould a villain of. 
Hippolito, wish him repair to us, 
If there be ought in him to please our blood; 
For thy sake we'll advance him and build fair 
His meanest fortunes, for it is in us 
To rear up towers from cottages.

HIPPOLITO 
It is so, my lord, he will attend your honour; 
But he's a man in whom much melancholy dwells.

LUSSURIOSO 
Why, the better; bring him to court.

HIPPOLITO 
With willingness and speed. 
[Aside] Whom he cast off e'en now must now succeed. 
Brother, disguise must off; 
In thine own shape now I'll prefer thee to him: 
How strangely does himself work to undo him.

Exit.

LUSSURIOSO 
This fellow will come fitly; he shall kill 
That other slave that did abuse my spleen 
And made it swell to treason. I have put 
Much of my heart into him; he must die. 
He that knows great men's secrets and proves slight, 
That man ne'er lives to see his beard turn white. 
Ay, he shall speed him; I'll employ the brother: 
Slaves are but nails to drive out one another. 
He being of black condition, suitable 
To want and ill content, hope of preferment 
Will grind him to an edge.

The Nobles enter.

FIRST NOBLE 
Good days unto your honour.

LUSSURIOSO 
My kind lords, I do return the like.

SECOND NOBLE 
Saw you my lord the duke?

LUSSURIOSO 
My lord and father, is he from court?

FIRST NOBLE 
He's sure from court, 
But where, which way his pleasure took, we know not, 
Nor can we hear on't.

[Enter the Duke's Gentlemen.]

LUSSURIOSO 
Here come those should tell. 
Saw you my lord and father?

[FIRST GENTLEMAN] 
Not since two hours before noon, my lord, 
And then he privately rid forth.

LUSSURIOSO 
Oh, he's [rid] forth?

FIRST NOBLE 
'Twas wondrous privately.

SECOND NOBLE 
There's none i' th' court had any knowledge on't.

LUSSURIOSO 
His grace is old and sudden; 'tis no treason 
To say the duke my father has a humour 
Or such a toy about him: what in us 
Would appear light, in him seems virtuous.

[FIRST GENTLEMAN] 
'Tis oracle, my lord.

Exeunt.


[IV.ii. The palace]
Enter [Vindici] and Hippolito, Vindici out of his disguise.

HIPPOLITO 
So, so, all's as it should be; y'are yourself.

VINDICI 
How that great villain puts me to my shifts!

HIPPOLITO 
He that did lately in disguise reject thee 
Shall, now thou art thyself, as much respect thee.

VINDICI 
'Twill be the quainter fallacy; but, brother, 
'Sfoot, what use will he put me to now, think'st thou?

HIPPOLITO 
Nay, you must pardon me in that, I know not: 
H'as some employment for you, but what 'tis 
He and his secretary, the devil, knows best.

VINDICI 
Well, I must suit my tongue to his desires, 
What colour soe'er they be, hoping at last 
To pile up all my wishes on his breast.

HIPPOLITO 
Faith, brother, he himself shows the way.

VINDICI 
Now the duke is dead, the realm is clad in clay: 
His death being not yet known, under his name 
The people still are govern'd. Well, thou his son 
Art not long-liv'd; thou shalt not 'joy his death: 
To kill thee then, I should most honour thee, 
For 'twould stand firm in every man's belief 
Thou'st a kind child and only died'st with grief.

HIPPOLITO 
You fetch about well, but let's talk in present. 
How will you appear in fashion different, 
As well as in apparel, to make all things possible? 
If you be but once tripp'd, we fall forever. 
It is not the least policy to be doubtful; 
You must change tongue: familiar was your first.

VINDICI 
Why, I'll bear me in some strain of melancholy 
And string myself with heavy-sounding wire, 
Like such an instrument, that speaks merry 
Things sadly.

HIPPOLITO 
Then 'tis as I meant: 
I gave you out at first in discontent.

VINDICI 
I'll turn myself, and then--

[Enter Lussurioso.]

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside to Vindici] 'Sfoot, here he comes! 
Hast thought upon't?

VINDICI 
[Aside to Hippolito] Salute him, fear not me.

LUSSURIOSO 
Hippolito.

HIPPOLITO 
Your lordship.

LUSSURIOSO 
What's he yonder?

HIPPOLITO 
'Tis Vindici, my discontented brother, 
Whom 'cording to your will I've brought to court.

LUSSURIOSO 
Is that thy brother? Beshrew me, a good presence; 
I wonder h'as been from the court so long. [To Vindici] Come nearer.

HIPPOLITO 
Brother, Lord Lussurioso, the duke['s] son.

[Vindici] snatches off his hat and makes legs to him.

LUSSURIOSO 
Be more near to us; welcome, nearer yet.

VINDICI 
How don you? God you god den.

LUSSURIOSO 
We thank thee. 
How strangely such a coarse, homely salute 
Shows in the palace, where we greet in fire 
Nimble and desperate tongues; should we name 
God in a salutation, 'twould ne'er be stood on't. Heaven! 
Tell me, what has made thee so melancholy?

VINDICI 
Why, going to law.

LUSSURIOSO 
Why, will that make a man melancholy?

VINDICI 
Yes, to look long upon ink and black buckram: I went me to law in anno quadregesimo secundo, and I waded out of it in anno sextagesimo tertio.

LUSSURIOSO 
What, three and twenty years in law?

VINDICI 
I have known those that have been five and fifty, and all about pullen and pigs.

LUSSURIOSO 
May it be possible such men should breath, 
To vex the terms so much?

VINDICI 
'Tis food to some, my lord. There are old men at the present that are so poisoned with the affectation of law-words, having had many suites canvass'd, that their common talk is nothing but Barbary Latin: they cannot so much as pray but in law, that their sins may be remov'd with a writ of error, and their souls fetch'd up to heaven with a sasarara.

[LUSSURIOSO] 
It seems most strange to me, 
Yet all the world meets round in the same bent: 
Where the heart's set, there goes the tongue's consent. 
How dost apply thy studies, fellow?

VINDICI 
Study? Why, to think how a great, rich man lies a-dying, and a poor cobbler tolls the bell for him; how he cannot depart the world, and see the great chest stand before him; when he lies speechless, how he will point you readily to all the boxes; and when he is past all memory, as the gossips guess, then thinks he of forfeitures and obligations; nay, when to all men's hearings he whirls and rattles in the throat, he's busy threat'ning his poor tenants; and this would last me now some seven years thinking or thereabouts. But I have a conceit a-coming in picture upon this: I draw it myself, which, i'faith la, I'll present to your honour; you shall not choose but like it, for your lordship shall give me nothing for it.

LUSSURIOSO 
Nay, you mistake me then, 
For I am publish'd bountiful enough; 
Let's taste of your conceit.

VINDICI 
In picture, my lord?

LUSSURIOSO 
Ay, in picture.

VINDICI 
Marry, this it is: 
"A usuring father to be boiling in hell, 
And his son and heir with a whore dancing over him."

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside] H'as par'd him to the quick.

LUSSURIOSO 
The conceit's pretty, i'faith, 
But take 't upon my life, 'twill ne'er be lik'd.

VINDICI 
No? Why, I'm sure the whore will be lik'd well enough.

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside] Ay, if she were out a' th' picture, he'd like her then himself.

VINDICI 
And as for the son and heir, he shall be an eyesore to no young revellers, for he shall be drawn in cloth-of-gold breeches.

LUSSURIOSO 
And thou hast put my meaning in the pockets 
And canst not draw that out; my thought was this: 
To see the picture of a usuring father 
Boiling in hell, our rich men would ne'er like it.

VINDICI 
Oh, true, I cry you heartily mercy! I know the reason, for some of 'em had rather be damn'd indeed than damn'd in colours.

LUSSURIOSO 
[Aside] A parlous melancholy; h'as wit enough 
To murder any man, and I'll give him means.-- 
I think thou art ill-monied.

VINDICI 
Money! Ho, ho! 
'T 'as been my want so long, 'tis now my scoff. 
I've e'en forgot what colour silver's of.

LUSSURIOSO 
[Aside] It hits as I could wish.

VINDICI 
I get good clothes 
Of those that dread my humour, and for tableroom, 
I feed on those that cannot be rid of me.

LUSSURIOSO 
[Giving him gold] Somewhat to set thee up withal.

VINDICI 
Oh, mine eyes!

LUSSURIOSO 
How now, man?

VINDICI 
Almost struck blind! 
This bright, unusual shine to me seems proud; 
I dare not look till the sun be in a cloud.

LUSSURIOSO 
[Aside] I think I shall affect his melancholy.-- 
How are they now?

VINDICI 
The better for your asking.

LUSSURIOSO 
You shall be better yet if you but fasten 
Truly on my intent; now y'are both present, 
I will unbrace such a close, private villain 
Unto your vengeful swords, the like ne'er heard of, 
Who hath disgrac'd you much and injur'd us.

HIPPOLITO 
Disgraced us, my lord?

LUSSURIOSO 
Ay, Hippolito. 
I kept it here till now that both your angers 
Might meet him at once.

VINDICI 
I'm covetous 
To know the villain.

LUSSURIOSO 
You know him: that slave pander, 
Piato, whom we threatened last 
With iron's perpetual prisonment.

VINDICI 
[Aside] All this is I.

HIPPOLITO 
Is't he, my lord?

LUSSURIOSO 
I'll tell you, 
You first preferr'd him to me.

VINDICI 
Did you, brother?

HIPPOLITO 
I did indeed.

LUSSURIOSO 
And the ingrateful villain, 
To quit that kindness, strongly wrought with me, 
Being as you see a likely man for pleasure, 
With jewels to corrupt your virgin sister.

HIPPOLITO 
Oh, villain!

VINDICI 
He shall surely die that did it.

LUSSURIOSO 
Ay, far from thinking any virgin harm, 
Especially knowing her to be as chaste 
As that part which scarce suffers to be touch'd, 
Th' eye would not endure him.

VINDICI 
Would you not, my lord? 
'Twas wondrous honourably done.

LUSSURIOSO 
But with some [fine] frowns kept him out.

VINDICI 
Out, slave!

LUSSURIOSO 
What did me he but in revenge of that 
Went of his own free will to make infirm 
Your sister's honour, whom I honour with my soul 
For chaste respect, and not prevailing there, 
As 'twas but desperate folly to attempt it, 
In mere spleen, by the way, waylays your mother, 
Whose honour being a coward as it seems 
Yielded by little force.

VINDICI 
Coward indeed!

LUSSURIOSO 
He, proud of their advantage, as he thought, 
Brought me these news for happy, but I, 
Heaven forgive me for't--

VINDICI 
What did your honour?

LUSSURIOSO 
In rage push'd him from me, 
Trampled beneath his throat, spurn'd him, and bruis'd: 
Indeed I was too cruel, to say troth.

HIPPOLITO 
Most nobly manag'd.

VINDICI 
Has not heaven an ear? Is all lightning wasted?

LUSSURIOSO 
If I now were so impatient in a modest cause, 
What should you be?

VINDICI 
Full mad: he shall not live 
To see the moon change.

LUSSURIOSO 
He's about the palace; 
Hippolito, entice him this way, that thy brother 
May take full mark of him.

HIPPOLITO 
Heart, that shall not need, my lord, 
I can direct him so far.

LUSSURIOSO 
Yet for my hate's sake, 
Go, wind him this way; I'll see him bleed myself.

HIPPOLITO 
[Taking Vindici aside] What now, brother?

VINDICI 
Nay, e'en what you will: y'are put to't, brother.

HIPPOLITO 
An impossible task, I'll swear, 
To bring him hither that's already here.

Exit Hippolito.

LUSSURIOSO 
Thy name, I have forgot it.

VINDICI 
[Vindici], my lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
'Tis a good name, that.

VINDICI 
Ay, a revenger.

LUSSURIOSO 
It does betoken courage: [thou] shouldst be valiant 
And kill thine enemies.

VINDICI 
That's my hope, my lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
This slave is one.

VINDICI 
I'll doom him.

LUSSURIOSO 
Then I'll praise thee. 
Do thou observe me best, and I'll best raise thee.

Enter Hippolito.

VINDICI 
Indeed, I thank you.

LUSSURIOSO 
Now, Hippolito, 
Where's the slave pander?

HIPPOLITO 
Your good lordship 
Would have a loathsome sight of him, much offensive. 
He's not in case now to be seen, my lord; 
The worst of all the deadly sins is in him: 
That beggarly damnation, drunkenness.

LUSSURIOSO 
Then he's a double slave.

VINDICI 
[Aside to Hippolito] 'Twas well convey'd 
Upon a sudden wit.

LUSSURIOSO 
What, are you both 
Firmly resolv'd? I'll see him dead myself.

VINDICI 
Or else let not us live.

LUSSURIOSO 
You may direct 
Your brother to take note of him.

HIPPOLITO 
I shall.

LUSSURIOSO 
Rise but in this and you shall never fall.

VINDICI 
Your honour's vassals.

LUSSURIOSO 
[Aside] This was wisely carried. 
Deep policy in us makes fools of such: 
Then must a slave die when he knows too much.

Exit Lussurioso.

VINDICI 
Oh, thou almighty patience, 'tis my wonder 
That such a fellow, impudent and wicked, 
Should not be cloven as he stood, 
Or with a secret wind burst open! 
Is there no thunder left, or is't kept up 
In stock for heavier vengeance? There it goes!

HIPPOLITO 
Brother, we lose ourselves.

VINDICI 
But I have found it. 
'Twill hold, 'tis sure; thanks, thanks to any spirit 
That mingled it 'mongst my inventions!

HIPPOLITO 
What is't?

VINDICI 
'Tis sound and good, thou shalt partake it: 
I'm hir'd to kill myself.

HIPPOLITO 
True.

VINDICI 
Prithee mark it: 
And the old duke being dead but not convey'd, 
For he's already miss'd too, and you know 
Murder will peep out of the closest husk.

HIPPOLITO 
Most true.

VINDICI 
What say you then to this device, 
If we dress'd up the body of the duke?

HIPPOLITO 
In that disguise of yours.

VINDICI 
Y'are quick, y'ave reach'd it.

HIPPOLITO 
I like it wondrously.

VINDICI 
And being in drink, as you have publish'd him, 
To lean him on his elbow, as if sleep had caught him, 
Which claims most interest in such sluggy men.

HIPPOLITO 
Good yet, but here's a doubt: 
[We], thought by th' duke's son to kill that pander, 
Shall when he is known be thought to kill the duke.

VINDICI 
Neither. Oh, thanks, it is substantial! 
For that disguise being on him, which I wore, 
It will be thought I, which he calls the pander, 
Did kill the duke and fled away in his apparel, 
Leaving him so disguis'd to avoid swift pursuit.

HIPPOLITO 
Firmer and firmer.

VINDICI 
Nay, doubt not 'tis in grain; 
I warrant it hold colour.

HIPPOLITO 
Let's about it.

VINDICI 
But, by the way too, now I think on't, brother, 
Let's conjure that base devil out of our mother.

Exeunt.


[IV.iii. The palace]
Enter the Duchess arm in arm with the bastard [Spurio]; he seemeth lasciviously to her. After them, enter Supervacuo, running with a rapier, his brother [Ambitioso] stops him.

SPURIO 
Madam, unlock yourself; should it be seen, 
Your arm would be suspected.

DUCHESS 
Who is't that dares suspect, or this or these? 
May not we deal our favours where we please?

SPURIO 
I'm confident you may.

Exeunt [Duchess and Spurio].

AMBITIOSO 
'Sfoot, brother, hold!

SUPERVACUO 
Woult let the bastard shame us?

AMBITIOSO 
Hold, hold, brother; 
There's fitter time than now.

SUPERVACUO 
Now, when I see it!

AMBITIOSO 
'Tis too much seen already.

SUPERVACUO 
Seen and known, 
The nobler she's, the baser is she grown.

AMBITIOSO 
If she were bent lasciviously, the fault 
Of mighty women that sleep soft. Oh, death, 
Must she needs choose such an unequal sinner 
To make all worse?

SUPERVACUO 
A bastard, the duke's bastard! 
Shame heap'd on shame!

AMBITIOSO 
Oh, our disgrace! 
Most women have small [waist] the world throughout, 
But [their] desires are thousand miles about.

SUPERVACUO 
Come, stay not here, let's after and prevent, 
Or else they'll sin faster than we'll repent.


[IV.iv. Vindici's house]
Enter [Vindici] and Hippolito bringing out [their] mother [Gratiana], one by one shoulder, and the other by the other, with daggers in their hands.

VINDICI 
Oh, thou for whom no name is bad enough!

[GRATIANA] 
What means my sons? What, will you murder me?

VINDICI 
Wicked, unnatural parent!

HIPPOLITO 
Fiend of women!

[GRATIANA] 
Oh! Are sons turn'd monsters? Help!

VINDICI 
In vain.

[GRATIANA] 
Are you so barbarous to set iron nipples 
Upon the breast that gave you suck?

VINDICI 
That breast 
Is turned to quarled poison.

[GRATIANA] 
Cut not your days for't: am not I your mother?

VINDICI 
Thou dost usurp that title now by fraud, 
For in that shell of mother breeds a bawd.

[GRATIANA] 
A bawd? Oh, name far loathsomer than hell!

HIPPOLITO 
It should be so, knew'st thou thy office well.

[GRATIANA] 
I hate it!

VINDICI 
Ah, is't possible, you powers on high, 
That women should dissemble when they die?

[GRATIANA] 
Dissemble!

VINDICI 
Did not the duke's son direct 
A fellow of the world's condition hither, 
That did corrupt all that was good in thee, 
Made thee uncivilly forget thyself, 
And work our sister to his lust?

[GRATIANA] 
Who, I? 
That had been monstrous! I defy that man 
For any such intent: none lives so pure 
But shall be soil'd with slander. 
Good son, believe it not.

VINDICI 
Oh, I'm in doubt, 
Whether I'm myself or no. 
Stay, let me look again upon this face. 
Who shall be sav'd when mothers have no grace?

HIPPOLITO 
'Twould make one half despair.

VINDICI 
I was the man. 
Defy me now? Let's see do't modestly.

[GRATIANA] 
Oh, hell unto my soul!

VINDICI 
In that disguise, I sent from the duke's son, 
Tried you, you, and found you base metal 
As any villain might have done.

[GRATIANA] 
Oh, no, 
No tongue but yours could have bewitch'd me so.

VINDICI 
Oh, nimble in damnation, quick in tune; 
There is no devil could strike fire so soon! 
I am confuted in a word.

[GRATIANA] 
Oh, sons, 
Forgive me; to myself I'll prove more true: 
You that should honour me, I kneel to you.

VINDICI 
A mother to give aim to her own daughter.

HIPPOLITO 
True, brother, how far beyond nature 'tis, 
Tho' many mothers do't.

VINDICI 
Nay, and you draw tears once, go you to bed. 
Wet will make iron blush and change to red: 
Brother, it rains, 'twill spoil your dagger; house it.

HIPPOLITO 
'Tis done.

VINDICI 
I'faith, 'tis a sweet shower; it does much good. 
The fruitful grounds and meadows of her soul 
Has been long dry: pour down thou blessed dew. 
Rise, mother; troth, this shower has made you higher.

[GRATIANA] 
Oh, you heavens! 
Take this infectious spot out of my soul; 
I'll rinse it in seven waters of mine eyes. 
Make my tears salt enough to taste of grace. 
To weep is to our sex naturally given, 
But to weep truly, that's a gift from heaven.

VINDICI 
Nay, I'll kiss you now. Kiss her, brother. 
Let's marry her to our souls, wherein's no lust, 
And honourably love her.

HIPPOLITO 
Let it be.

VINDICI 
For honest women are so [seld] and rare, 
'Tis good to cherish those poor few that are. 
Oh, you of easy wax, do but imagine 
Now the disease has left you, how leprously 
That office would have cling'd unto your forehead. 
All mothers that had any graceful hue 
Would have worn masks to hide their face at you; 
It would have grown to this: at your foul name 
Green-colour'd maids would have turn'd red with shame.

HIPPOLITO 
And then our sister, full of hire and baseness--

VINDICI 
There had been boiling lead again. 
The duke's son's great concubine! 
A drab of state, a cloth-a'-silver slut, 
To have her train borne up and her soul trail 
I' th' dirt: great!

HIPPOLITO 
To be miserably great; rich, 
To be eternally wretched.

VINDICI 
Oh, common madness! 
Ask but the thriving'st harlot in cold blood, 
She'd give the world to make her honour good. 
Perhaps you'll say but only to th' duke's son 
In private; why, she first begins with one 
Who afterward to thousand proves a whore: 
"Break ice in one place, it will crack in more."

[GRATIANA] 
Most certainly applied.

HIPPOLITO 
Oh, brother, you forget our business.

VINDICI 
And well rememb'red; joy's a subtle elf: 
I think man's happiest when he forgets himself. 
Farewell, once dried, now holy-wat'red mead; 
Our hearts wear feathers that before wore lead.

[GRATIANA] 
I'll give you this, that one I never knew 
Plead better for and 'gainst the devil than you.

VINDICI 
You make me proud on't.

HIPPOLITO 
Commend us in all virtue to our sister.

VINDICI 
Ay, for the love of heaven, to that true maid.

[GRATIANA] 
With my best words.

VINDICI 
Why, that was motherly said.

Exeunt [Vindici and Hippolito].

[GRATIANA] 
I wonder now what fury did transport me? 
I feel good thoughts begin to settle in me. 
Oh, with what forehead can I look on her 
Whose honour I've so impiously beset?

[Enter Castiza.]

And here she comes.

CASTIZA 
Now, mother, you have wrought with me so strongly 
That what for my advancement, as to calm 
The trouble of your tongue: I am content.

[GRATIANA] 
Content to what?

CASTIZA 
To do as you have wish'd me, 
To prostitute my breast to the duke's son, 
And to put myself to common usury.

[GRATIANA] 
I hope you will not so!

CASTIZA 
Hope you I will not? 
That's not the hope you look to be saved in.

[GRATIANA] 
Truth, but it is.

CASTIZA 
Do not deceive yourself; 
I am as you e'en out of marble wrought. 
What would you now? Are ye not pleas'd yet with me? 
You shall not wish me to be more lascivious 
Than I intend to be.

[GRATIANA] 
Strike not me cold.

CASTIZA 
How often have you charg'd me on your blessing 
To be a cursed woman! When you knew 
Your blessing had no force to make me lewd, 
You laid your curse upon me. That did more; 
The mother's curse is heavy: where that fights, 
Suns set in storm and daughters lose their lights.

[GRATIANA] 
Good child, dear maid, if there be any spark 
Of heavenly intellectual fire within thee, 
Oh, let my breath revive it to a flame! 
Put not all out with woman's wilful follies. 
I am recover'd of that foul disease 
That haunts too many mothers. Kind, forgive me; 
Make me not sick in health: if then 
My words prevail'd when they were wickedness, 
How much more now when they are just and good?

CASTIZA 
I wonder what you mean. Are not you she 
For whose infect persuasions I could scarce 
Kneel out my prayers, and had much ado 
In three hours reading to untwist so much 
Of the black serpent as you wound about me?

[GRATIANA] 
'Tis unfruitful, held tedious to repeat what's past; 
I'm now your present mother.

CASTIZA 
Push, now 'tis too late.

[GRATIANA] 
Bethink again, thou know'st not what thou sayst.

CASTIZA 
No? Deny advancement, treasure, the duke's son?

[GRATIANA] 
Oh, see, 
I spoke those words, and now they poison me! 
What will the deed do then? 
Advancement? True, as high as shame can pitch. 
For treasure, whoe'er knew a harlot rich, 
Or could build by the purchase of her sin 
An hospital to keep their bastards in? 
The duke's son! Oh, when women are young courtiers, 
They are sure to be old beggars! 
To know the miseries most harlots taste, 
Thou'dst wish thyself unborn when thou art unchaste.

CASTIZA 
Oh, mother, let me twine about your neck, 
And kiss you till my soul melt on your lips: 
I did but this to try you.

[GRATIANA] 
Oh, speak truth!

CASTIZA 
Indeed, I did not, for no tongue has force 
To alter me from honest. 
If maidens would, men's words could have no power. 
A virgin honour is a crystal tower, 
Which being weak is guarded with good spirits: 
Until she basely yields no ill inherits.

[GRATIANA] 
Oh, happy child! Faith and thy birth hath saved me. 
'Mongst thousands daughters happiest of all others! 
[Be] thou a glass for maids, and I for mothers.

Exeunt.


[V.i. A room in the palace]
Enter [Vindici] and Hippolito [with the Duke's corpse in Piato's clothes, which they prop up in chair].

VINDICI 
So, so, he leans well; take heed you wake him not, brother.

HIPPOLITO 
I warrant you, my life for yours.

VINDICI 
That's a good lay, for I must kill myself! 
Brother, that's I: that sits for me, do you mark it? 
And I must stand ready here to make away myself yonder: I must sit to be kill'd, and stand to kill myself. I could vary it not so little as thrice over again, 't 'as some eight returns like Michaelmas Term.

HIPPOLITO 
That's enow, a' conscience.

VINDICI 
But, sirrah, does the duke's son come single?

HIPPOLITO 
No, there's the hell on't, his faith's too feeble to go alone; he brings flesh-flies after him that will buzz against suppertime and hum for his coming out.

VINDICI 
Ah, the fly-flop of vengeance beat 'em to pieces! Here was the sweetest occasion, the fittest hour, to have made my revenge familiar with him, show him the body of the duke his father, and how quaintly he died like a politician in huggermugger, made no man acquainted with it, and in catastrophe slain him over his father's breast, and oh, I'm mad to lose such a sweet opportunity!

HIPPOLITO 
Nay, push, prithee be content! There's no remedy present; may not hereafter times open in as fair faces as this?

VINDICI 
They may if they can paint so well.

HIPPOLITO 
Come, now to avoid all suspicion, let's forsake this room, and be going to meet the duke's son.

VINDICI 
Content, I'm for any weather.

Enter Lussurioso.

Heart, step close, here he comes!

HIPPOLITO 
My honour'd lord?

LUSSURIOSO 
Oh, me; you both present?

VINDICI 
E'en newly, my lord, just as your lordship enter'd now; about this place we had notice given he should be, but in some loathsome plight or other.

HIPPOLITO 
Came your honour private?

LUSSURIOSO 
Private enough for this: only a few 
Attend my coming out.

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside] Death rot those few!

LUSSURIOSO 
Stay, yonder's the slave.

VINDICI 
Mass, there's the slave indeed, my lord! 
[Aside] 'Tis a good child, he calls his father slave.

LUSSURIOSO 
Ay, that's the villain, the damn'd villain: softly, 
Tread easy.

VINDICI 
Puh, I warrant you, my lord, 
We'll stifle in our breaths.

LUSSURIOSO 
That will do well. 
[Aside] Base rogue, thou sleepest thy last; 'tis policy 
To have him kill'd in's sleep, for if he wak'd 
He would betray all to them.

VINDICI 
But, my lord--

LUSSURIOSO 
Ha, what sayst?

VINDICI 
Shall we kill him now he's drunk?

LUSSURIOSO 
Ay, best of all.

VINDICI 
Why, then he will ne'er live to be sober.

LUSSURIOSO 
No matter, let him reel to hell.

VINDICI 
But being so full of liquor, I fear he will put out all the fire--

LUSSURIOSO 
Thou art a mad beast.

VINDICI 
And leave none to warm your lordship's golls withal, 
For he that dies drunk falls into hellfire 
Like a bucket a' water, qush, qush.

LUSSURIOSO 
Come, be ready, nake your swords; think of your wrongs: 
This slave has injur'd you.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Troth, so he has, 
And he has paid well for't.

LUSSURIOSO 
Meet with him now.

VINDICI 
You'll bear us out, my lord?

LUSSURIOSO 
Puh, am I a lord for nothing think you? Quickly, now.

VINDICI 
Sa, sa, sa! [Stabs the corpse.] Thump, there he lies.

LUSSURIOSO 
Nimbly done. Ha? Oh, villains, murderers, 
'Tis the old duke my father!

VINDICI 
That's a jest.

LUSSURIOSO 
What stiff and cold already? 
Oh, pardon me to call you from your names; 
'Tis none of your deed: that villain Piato, 
Whom you thought now to kill, has murder'd him 
And left him thus disguis'd.

HIPPOLITO 
And not unlikely.

VINDICI 
Oh, rascal! Was he not asham'd 
To put the duke into a greasy doublet?

LUSSURIOSO 
He has been cold and stiff who knows how long?

VINDICI 
[Aside] Marry, that do I!

LUSSURIOSO 
No words, I pray, of anything intended.

VINDICI 
Oh, my lord!

HIPPOLITO 
I would fain have your lordship think that we have small reason to prate.

LUSSURIOSO 
Faith, thou sayst true; I'll forthwith send to court 
For all the nobles, bastard, duchess, all, 
How here by miracle we found him dead, 
And in his raiment that foul villain fled.

VINDICI 
That will be the best way, my lord, to clear us all: let's cast about to be clear.

LUSSURIOSO 
Ho, Nencio, Sordido, and the rest!

Enter all [Lussurioso's attendants].

[SORDIDO] 
My lord.

[NENCIO] 
My lord.

LUSSURIOSO 
Be witnesses of a strange spectacle: 
Choosing for private conference that sad room, 
We found the duke my father 'geal'd in blood.

[SORDIDO] 
My lord, the duke! Run, hie thee, Nencio, 
Startle the court by signifying so much.

[Exit Nencio.]

VINDICI 
[Aside to Hippolito] Thus much by wit a deep revenger can: 
When murder's known, to be the clearest man. 
We're fardest off, and with as bold an eye 
Survey his body as the standers-by.

LUSSURIOSO 
My royal father, too basely let blood 
By a malevolent slave!

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside to Vindici] Hark, he calls thee slave again.

VINDICI 
[Aside to Hippolito] Ha's lost, he may.

LUSSURIOSO 
Oh, sight, look hither! See, his lips are gnawn with poison!

VINDICI 
How! His lips? By th' mass, they be!

LUSSURIOSO 
Oh, villain! Oh, rogue! Oh, slave! Oh, rascal!

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside] Oh, good deceit! He quits him with like terms.

[Enter Ambitioso, Supervacuo, Spurio, Duchess, the Duke's Gentlemen, Nobles, and guards.]

FIRST NOBLE 
Where?

SECOND NOBLE 
Which way?

AMBITIOSO 
Over what roof hangs this prodigious comet 
In deadly fire?

LUSSURIOSO 
Behold, behold, my lords: 
The duke my father's murder'd by a vassal 
That owes this habit, and here left disguis'd.

DUCHESS 
My lord and husband!

SECOND NOBLE 
Reverend majesty!

FIRST NOBLE 
I have seen these clothes often attending on him.

VINDICI 
[Aside] That nobleman has been i' th' country, for he does not lie.

SUPERVACUO 
[Aside to Ambitioso] Learn of our mother; let's dissemble too. 
I am glad he's vanish'd; so I hope are you.

AMBITIOSO 
[Aside to Supervacuo] Ay, you may take my word for't.

SPURIO 
[Aside] Old Dad dead? 
Ay, one of his cast sins will send the fates 
Most hearty commendations by his own son. 
I'll tug the new stream till strength be done.

LUSSURIOSO 
Where be those two that did affirm to us 
My lord the duke was privately rid forth?

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
Oh, pardon us, my lords, he gave that charge 
Upon our lives if he were miss'd at court 
To answer so; he rode not anywhere, 
We left him private with that fellow here.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Confirm'd.

LUSSURIOSO 
Oh heavens, that false charge was his death! 
Impudent beggars, durst you to our face, 
Maintain such a false answer? Bear him straight 
To execution.

FIRST GENTLEMAN 
My lord!

LUSSURIOSO 
Urge me no more. 
In this excuse may be call'd half the murther.

VINDICI 
[Aside] You've sentenc'd well.

LUSSURIOSO 
Away, see it be done.

[Exit the First Gentleman, guarded.]

VINDICI 
[Aside] Could you not stick? See what confession doth. 
Who would not lie when men are hang'd for truth?

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside to Vindici] Brother, how happy is our vengeance?

VINDICI 
[Aside to Hippolito] Why, it hits, 
Past the apprehension of indifferent wits.

LUSSURIOSO 
My lord, let post-horse be sent 
Into all places to entrap the villain.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Post-horse? Ha, ha!

[FIRST] NOBLE 
My lord, we're something bold to know our duty. 
You father's accidentally departed; 
The titles that were due to him meet you.

LUSSURIOSO 
Meet me? I'm not at leisure, my good lord; 
I've many griefs to dispatch out a' th' way. 
[Aside] Welcome, sweet titles!--Talk to me, my lords, 
Of sepulchers and mighty emperors' bones, 
That's thought for me.

VINDICI 
[Aside] So, one may see by this 
How foreign markets go: 
Courtiers have feet a' th' nines and tongues a' th' twelves; 
They flatter dukes and dukes flatter themselves.

[FIRST] NOBLE 
My lord, it is your shine must comfort us.

LUSSURIOSO 
Alas, I shine in tears like the sun in April.

[FIRST] NOBLE 
You're now my lord's grace.

LUSSURIOSO 
My lord's grace? I perceive you'll have it so.

[FIRST] NOBLE 
'Tis but your own.

LUSSURIOSO 
Then heavens give me grace to be so.

VINDICI 
[Aside] He prays well for himself.

[FIRST] NOBLE 
Madam, all sorrows 
Must run their circles into joys; no doubt but time 
Will make the murderer bring forth himself.

VINDICI 
[Aside] He were an ass then, i'faith.

[FIRST] NOBLE 
In the mean season, 
Let us bethink the latest funeral honours 
Due to the duke's cold body, and withal, 
Calling to memory our new happiness, 
Spread in his royal son: lords, gentlemen, 
Prepare for revels.

VINDICI 
[Aside] Revels!

NOBLE 
Time hath several falls. 
Griefs lift up joys, feasts put down funerals.

LUSSURIOSO 
Come then, my lords, my favours to you all. 
[Aside] The duchess is suspected foully bent; 
I'll begin dukedom with her banishment.

Exeunt Duke [Lussurioso], Nobles, [Gentlemen, Attendants,] and Duchess.

HIPPOLITO 
[Aside to Vindici] Revels!

VINDICI 
[Aside to Hippolito] Ay, that's the word; we are firm yet: 
Strike one strain more and then we crown our wit.

Exeunt brothers [Vindici and Hippolito].

SPURIO 
Well, have the fairest mark, so said the duke when he begot me, 
And if I miss his heart or near about, 
Then have at any: a bastard scorns to be out.

[Exit Spurio.]

SUPERVACUO 
Not'st thou that Spurio, brother?

[AMBITIOSO] 
Yes, I note him to our shame.

SUPERVACUO 
He shall not live; his hair shall not grow much longer: in this time of revels, tricks may be set afoot. Seest thou yon new moon? It shall out-live the new duke by much; this hand shall dispossess him, then we're mighty. 
A masque is treason's license; that build upon: 
'Tis murder's best face when a vizard's on.

Exit [Supervacuo].

AMBITIOSO 
Is't so? ['Tis] very good. 
And do you think to be duke then, kind brother? 
I'll see fair play: drop one and there lies t'other.

Exit Ambitioso.


[V.ii. Vindici's house]
Enter [Vindici] and Hippolito, with Piero and other Lords.

VINDICI 
My lords, be all of music; strike old griefs into other countries 
That flow in too much milk and have faint livers, 
Not daring to stab home their discontents: 
Let our hid flames break out as fire, as lightning, 
To blast this villainous dukedom vex'd with sin; 
Wind up your souls to their full height again.

PIERO 
How?

FIRST LORD 
Which way?

THIRD LORD 
Any way: our wrongs are such, 
We cannot justly be reveng'd too much.

VINDICI 
You shall have all enough. Revels are toward, 
And those few nobles that have long suppress'd you 
Are busied to the furnishing of a masque, 
And do affect to make a pleasant tale on't. 
The masquing suits are fashioning; now comes in 
That which must glad us all: we to take pattern 
Of all those suits, the colour, trimming, fashion, 
E'en to an undistinguish'd hair almost, 
Then ent'ring first, observing the true form, 
Within a strain or two we shall find leisure 
To steal our swords out handsomely, 
And when they think their pleasure sweet and good, 
In midst of all their joys, they shall sigh blood.

PIERO 
Weightily, effectually.

THIRD LORD 
Before the t'other masquers come.

VINDICI 
We're gone, all done and past.

PIERO 
But how for the duke's guard?

VINDICI 
Let that alone; 
By one and one their strengths shall be drunk down.

HIPPOLITO 
There are five hundred gentlemen in the action 
That will apply themselves and not stand idle.

PIERO 
Oh, let us hug your bosoms!

VINDICI 
Come, my lords, 
Prepare for deeds; let other times have words.

Exeunt.


[V.iii. The palace banqueting hall]
In a dumb show, the possessing of the young duke [Lussurioso] with all his Nobles. Then sounding music, a furnish'd table is brought forth; then enters the duke [Lussurioso] and his [three] Nobles to the banquet. A blazing star appeareth.

[FIRST] NOBLE 
Many harmonious hours and choicest pleasures 
Fill up the royal numbers of your years.

LUSSURIOSO 
My lords, we're pleas'd to thank you [aside] tho' we know 
'Tis but your duty now to wish it so.

[FIRST] NOBLE 
That shine makes us all happy.

THIRD NOBLE 
[Aside] His grace frowns?

SECOND NOBLE 
[Aside] Yet we must say he smiles.

FIRST NOBLE 
[Aside] I think we must.

LUSSURIOSO 
[Aside] That foul, incontinent duchess we have banish'd; 
The bastard shall not live: after these revels 
I'll begin strange ones; he and the stepsons 
Shall pay their lives for the first subsidies. 
We must not frown so soon, else 't 'ad been now.

FIRST NOBLE 
My gracious lord, please you prepare for pleasure: 
The masque is not far off.

LUSSURIOSO 
We are for pleasure. 
[To the comet] Beshrew thee, what art thou mad'st me start? 
Thou hast committed treason: a blazing star!

FIRST NOBLE 
A blazing star? Oh, where, my lord?

LUSSURIOSO 
Spy out!

SECOND NOBLE 
See, see, my lords: a wondrous, dreadful one.

LUSSURIOSO 
I am not pleas'd at that ill-knotted fire, 
That bushing, flaring star. Am not I duke? 
It should not quake me now: had it appear'd 
Before it, I might then have justly fear'd; 
But yet they say, whom art and learning weds, 
When stars [wear] locks, they threaten great men's heads. 
Is it so? You are read, my lords.

FIRST NOBLE 
May it please your grace, 
It shows great anger.

LUSSURIOSO 
That does not please our grace.

SECOND NOBLE 
Yet here's the comfort, my lord: many times 
When it seems most, it threatens fardest off.

LUSSURIOSO 
Faith, and I think so too.

FIRST NOBLE 
Beside, my lord, 
You're gracefully establish'd with the loves 
Of all your subjects: and for natural death, 
I hope it will be threescore years a-coming.

LUSSURIOSO 
True. No more but threescore years?

FIRST NOBLE 
Fourscore I hope, my lord.

SECOND NOBLE 
And fivescore, I.

THIRD NOBLE 
But 'tis my hope, my lord, you shall ne'er die.

LUSSURIOSO 
Give me thy hand; these others I rebuke. 
He that hopes so is fittest for a duke. 
Thou shalt sit next me; take your places, lords: 
We're ready now for sports; let 'em set on. 
[To the comet] You thing, we shall forget you quite anon!

THIRD NOBLE 
I hear 'em coming, my lord.

Enter the Masque of Revengers: the two brothers [Vindici and Hippolito] and two Lords more.

LUSSURIOSO 
Ah, 'tis well. 
[Aside] Brothers and bastard, you dance next in hell.

The Revengers dance. At the end, steal out their swords and these four kill the four at the table in their chairs. It thunders.

VINDICI 
Mark thunder? 
Dost know thy cue, thou big-voic'd crier? 
Dukes' groans are thunder's watchwords.

HIPPOLITO 
So, my lords, you have enough.

VINDICI 
Come, let's away, no ling'ring.

HIPPOLITO 
Follow, go.

Exeunt [Hippolito and the two lords].

VINDICI 
No power is angry when the lustful die; 
When thunder claps, heaven likes the tragedy.

Exit Vindici. Enter the other masque of intended murderers: stepsons [Ambitioso, Supervacuo], bastard [Spurio], and a Fourth Man [Ambitioso's henchman], coming in dancing; the duke [Lussurioso] recovers a little in voice and groans, calls, "A guard, treason," at which they all start out of their measure, and turning towards the table, they find them all to be murdered.

LUSSURIOSO 
Oh, oh!

SPURIO 
Whose groan was that?

LUSSURIOSO 
Treason, a guard!

AMBITIOSO 
How now? All murder'd!

SUPERVACUO 
Murder'd!

FOURTH MAN 
And those his nobles?

AMBITIOSO 
Here's a labour sav'd: 
I thought to have sped him. 'Sblood, how came this?

[SUPERVACUO] 
Then I proclaim myself: now I am duke.

AMBITIOSO 
Thou duke! Brother, thou liest.

[Kills Supervacuo.]

SPURIO 
Slave, so dost thou!

[Kills Ambitioso.]

FOURTH MAN 
Base villain, hast thou slain my lord and master?

[Kills Spurio.] Enter the first men [Vindici, Hippolito, the two Lords].

VINDICI 
Pistols, treason, murder! Help, guard my lord the duke!

[Enter Antonio, guards.]

HIPPOLITO 
Lay hold upon this traitor!

[The guards seize the Fourth Man.]

LUSSURIOSO 
Oh!

VINDICI 
Alas, the duke is murder'd!

HIPPOLITO 
And the nobles!

VINDICI 
Surgeons, surgeons! Heart, does he breathe so long?

ANTONIO 
A piteous tragedy, able to [make] 
An old man's eyes bloodshot.

LUSSURIOSO 
Oh!

VINDICI 
Look to my lord the duke! [Aside] A vengeance throttle him! 
[To the Fourth Man] Confess, thou murd'rous and [unhallowed] man, 
Didst thou kill all these?

FOURTH MAN 
None but the bastard I.

VINDICI 
How came the duke slain then?

FOURTH MAN 
We found him so.

LUSSURIOSO 
Oh, villain!

VINDICI 
Hark!

LUSSURIOSO 
Those in the masque did murder us.

VINDICI 
Law you now, sir. 
Oh, marble impudence! Will you confess now?

FOURTH MAN 
['Sblood], 'tis all false!

ANTONIO 
Away with that foul monster, 
Dipp'd in a prince's blood!

FOURTH MAN 
Heart, 'tis a lie!

ANTONIO 
Let him have bitter execution.

[Exit Fourth Man, guarded.]

VINDICI 
[Aside] New marrow! No, I cannot be express'd!-- 
How fares my lord the duke?

LUSSURIOSO 
Farewell to all; 
He that climbs highest has the greatest fall. 
My tongue is out of office.

VINDICI 
Air, gentlemen, air! 
[Whispering] Now thou'lt not prate on't, 'twas [Vindici] murd'red thee--

LUSSURIOSO 
Oh!

VINDICI 
Murd'red thy father--

LUSSURIOSO 
Oh!

VINDICI 
And I am he. 
Tell nobody. [Lussurioso dies.] So, so, the duke's departed.

ANTONIO 
It was a deadly hand that wounded him. 
The rest, ambitious who should rule and sway, 
After his death were so made all away.

VINDICI 
My lord was unlikely.

HIPPOLITO 
Now the hope 
Of Italy lies in your reverend years.

VINDICI 
Your hair will make the silver age again, 
When there was fewer but more honest men.

ANTONIO 
The burden's weighty and will press age down; 
May I so rule that heaven [may] keep the crown.

VINDICI 
The rape of your good lady has been quitted 
With death on death.

ANTONIO 
Just is the law above. 
But of all things it puts me most to wonder 
How the old duke came murd'red.

VINDICI 
Oh, my lord!

ANTONIO 
It was the strangeliest carried, I not [heard] 
Of the like.

HIPPOLITO 
'Twas all done for the best, my lord.

VINDICI 
All for your grace's good; we may be bold to speak it now, 
'Twas somewhat witty carried, tho' we say it. 
'Twas we two murd'red him.

ANTONIO 
You two?

VINDICI 
None else, i'faith, my lord; nay, 'twas well manag'd.

ANTONIO 
Lay hands upon those villains!

[Guards seize Vindici and Hippolito.]

VINDICI 
How? On us?

ANTONIO 
Bear 'em to speedy execution.

VINDICI 
Heart, was't not for your good, my lord?

ANTONIO 
My good! Away with 'em! Such an old man as he! 
You that would murder him would murder me.

VINDICI 
Is't come about?

HIPPOLITO 
'Sfoot, brother, you begun.

VINDICI 
May not we set as well as the duke's son? 
Thou hast no conscience: are we not reveng'd? 
Is there one enemy left alive amongst those? 
'Tis time to die when we are ourselves our foes. 
When murders shut deeds close, this curse does seal 'em: 
If none disclose 'em they themselves reveal 'em! 
This murder might have slept in tongueless brass 
But for ourselves, and the world died an ass. 
Now I remember too, here was Piato 
Brought forth a knavish sentence: no doubt, said he, 
But time will make the murderer bring forth himself. 
'Tis well he died; he was a witch. 
And now, my lord, since we are in forever, 
This work was ours which else might have been slipp'd, 
And if we list, we could have nobles clipp'd 
And go for less than beggars, but we hate 
To bleed so cowardly; we have enough. I'faith, 
We're well: our mother turn'd, our sister true, 
We die after a nest of dukes. Adieu.

Exeunt [Vindici and Hippolito, guarded].

ANTONIO 
How subtly was that murder clos'd! Bear up 
Those tragic bodies; 'tis a heavy season: 
Pray heaven their blood may wash away all treason.

[Exeunt omnes.]
