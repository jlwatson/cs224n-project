Tom Williams,  
  
You better come up with %100 of everyone's bitcoins ASAP even if you need to
buy them with your own money from one of the exchanges.  
  
Those bitcoins are YOUR responsibility.  
  
I can think of times in my life where I made mistakes, and paid tens of
thousands of dollars out of my own pocket to make things right.  
  
Now it is your turn.  
  
Do the right thing.
