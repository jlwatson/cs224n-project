Nefario,  
  
Does this mean they went snooping around through all your electronic devices?  
Did they make copies of your data?  
  
I was nearly tasered a few years ago at SFO for initially refusing to allow
the customs agents to read through the emails on my laptop.  
It is disgusting that the USA has turned into such a police state.
