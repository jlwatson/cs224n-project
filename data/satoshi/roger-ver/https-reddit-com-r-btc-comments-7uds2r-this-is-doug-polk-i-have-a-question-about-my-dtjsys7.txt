I will give it a try:

This was about 6 years ago now, but I recall that I emailed this person privately with all of his information and 100% proof that he had my money, and asked him to send it back to me.  He then published the entire email and doxed himself.  To this day, if there is proof, I think thieves should be doxed on the internet.  Law enforcement seems to [agree too](https://www.elpasotexas.gov/police-department/news-room/mug-shot-photos/assault).

When there are tens or hundreds of hours of content out there it is easy to pick two clips that sound contradictory.  My position is that I think lightning would be super neat if it could ever work reliably,  but on chain scaling is a long term solution that shouldn't be ignored.  Unfortunately Core supporters have broken a system that we had 8+ years of empirical evidence showing that it worked amazingly well, in favor of an untested system that may or may not work at some point in the future.  I think that was incredibly reckless.

At the time of the statement I had sold some on a futures market and hadn't taken delivery yet, so it could be interpreted either way.  If that was the worst thing I've done in my life, I think I'm doing pretty well.

People call Bitcoin Cash Bcash in an attempt to insult or belittle it.  These are the exact same reasons people use racial slurs.

After reading your post and watching the video,  I suspect you have never made a single lighting network transaction,  and likely haven't made any recent BTC or BCH transactions.  Is that assumption correct?
I invite you to give both a try, and I think you will instantly know which one is more useful to the world today.
