In a recent email, Zhou has promised to return 20,000 BTC and $140,000 USD
from the hacker.  
  
Myself, Tihan Seale and several other creditors have asked that Zhou
immediately transfer the funds to Patrick Murck.  
Patrick Murck is an experienced attorney who has done work for Bitinstant.com
and coinlabs.com  
He will hold the funds until a proper method to refund them to the proper
owners can be determined.  
  
Zhou initially was asking for the Intersango team of:  
Patrick Strateman  
Amir Taki  
Donald Norman  
  
to verify that they are ok with Patrick Murck holding the funds until they can
be refunded to the correct owners.  
  
I think all the creditors can agree that we would rather have the Bitinstant /
Coinlabs attorney hold the funds rather than whoever has them now.  
 **Patrick Strateman has blocked me on Skype, and does not reply to my emails.  
Donald and Amir have been out of touch for weeks.**  
  
 **Patrick Strateman, Amir, and Donald, for the good of the Bitcoin community
tell Zhou to release the funds to Patrick Murck NOW!**  
  
This way there will be no doubt whatsoever about what should be done with the
funds today.
