Inflation may increase nominal tax dollars, but not real dollars. So that's
really a wash.  

  
You are forgetting about "Bracket Creep"  
  
Bracket Creep is when inflation pushes peoples incomes into higher tax
brackets.  
The result is an increase in income tax rates, but no increase, or even a
decrease in real purchasing power.
