Wait, wait, wait. So Roger Ver has access to see users wallet passwords in
plaintext? So he can theoretically log in to any account on Blockchain.info
and send himself whatever he wants? Blaming it on "hackers"? Is that what is
happening here?  

  
 **NO, this is not possible.**  
  
If it was, I could have just taken my money back, and none of this would have
been an issue.  
  

  
What is this then?

Sincere question, I've never used bitchain.  

  
This is a secret phrase that can be used to help blockchain verify your
identity in case of a lost wallet identifier or yubikey or other 2nd factor
authentification reset request. It in no way grants access to the account
funds in any way.  
  
Basically it is used so Blockchain can verify that they are communicating with
the actual account owner.
