So what ended up happening with this?  
I see that bluenile still doesn't list BTC amongst their currencies... but did
Roger end up buying his engagement ring with Bitcoins?  
  
I just bought my engagement ring with Bitcoins  
see here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=176977.0  
  
  

  
The smaller merchant I bought the ring from now accepts Bitcoins.  
Perhaps I should circle back with Blue Nile and gently persuade them to add
them as a method on their site.  
  
Congratulations on your engagement Julz!
