Yuzo Kano, CEO of bitFlyer, one of the biggest Japanese Bitcoin exchanges, and
home of the world's cutest Block Explorer, is doing an AMA.  
  
He will have a lot of insight as to what is happening in Japan after MTGOX,
and the Japanese perspective on Bitcoin in general.  
He is also chief of JADA (Japan Authority of Digital Assets), a self-
regulatory authority which aims to open up dialog with governmental offices.
