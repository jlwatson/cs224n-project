You likely had this problem because you didn't actually send the coins within
the 15 minutes allotted by Bitpay.  
You likely just instructed some other entity to send the coins for you, and
they took their sweet time doing so.  
If you keep your bitcoins in a wallet in which you control the private keys,
you wont have this problem anymore.  
You also wont be creating additional work for the people at bitpay and
bitcoinstore.  
  
Some good examples are the Bitcoin QT client, Electrum and the blockchain.info
wallet  
  
Some bad examples are mtgox, bitstamp, and coinbase.
