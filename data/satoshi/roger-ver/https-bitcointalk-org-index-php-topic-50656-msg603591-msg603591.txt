I've been interested in www.freestateproject.org for several years now, and
even more so after meeting an active participant at the NYC Bitcoin
conference. (Evoorhees)  
  
Recently while surfing the internet I had an idea that I think may help
Bitcoins, the Free State Project, and Liberty in general, all while making
entertaining videos for the world to watch. I posted this idea at:  
http://forum.freekeene.com/index.php?topic=5614.0  
  
I suspect that the Liberty community will be some of the very first to adopt
Bitcoin on a wide scale, so I think this is a great opportunity for the
Bitcoin community to begin working with the Liberty community. (I know there
is a lot of overlap already)  
  
I would love to hear the Bitcoin community's thoughts on this plan.  
Feel free to post your thoughts in this forum or on the Free Keene forum.
