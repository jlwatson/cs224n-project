Is instawallet under some kind of attack?  
  
As I watch the site, the number of wallets is increasing faster than my eye
can follow. (Thousands of new wallets per minute)  
  
Also, my recent instawallet deposit was never credited to my wallet.  
  
What is going on?  
  
  
\-------------------------Update-------------------------  
  
Everyone at Instawallet is great and solved this problem very quickly.
