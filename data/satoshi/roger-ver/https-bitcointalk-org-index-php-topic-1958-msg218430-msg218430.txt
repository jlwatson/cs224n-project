I was contacted today by Germany's leading business weekly http://www.wiwo.de/  
  
Below are his questions and my tentative answers.  
Please mention anything else you would like me to add or mention in my
replies.  
It is nearly 2AM in Tokyo, so I will email him my replies in the morning.  
  
Thanks guys!  
  
  
What was your reason to accept Bitcoins?  
Bitcoins have a number of advantages over traditional payment methods. Nearly
every day people try to purchase memory from us with stolen credit card
numbers. If a customer pays with Bitcoins, we know for sure we have the money.  
Bitcoins are also faster and much cheaper than credit cards, paypal, or bank
wires.  
  
  
How do you cope with the volatile exchange rates?  
Bitcoin is a new technology that will revolutionize the world. Because the
long term price of bitcoins is increasing, and since I am not converting them
into national currencies, the volatile exchange rate is not much of a problem.  
  
And where lies the future for Bitcoins in your opinion?  
Bitcoins are the most important invention since the internet itself. They will
change the way the entire world does business.  
I predict that within a few years, Bitcoins will become a major currency in
the world.
