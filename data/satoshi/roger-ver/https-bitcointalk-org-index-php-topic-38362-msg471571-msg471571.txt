Where are the bitcoin atm machine going to roll out? I assume here in NYC? How
would they work? I'm excited about that.  
Also I've been trying to find out if there is anything happening today or not
as the agenda is a little screwy it says 9pm-12pm I'm sure that's a typo.  
  

  
He said the first Bitcoin ATM will be in San Diego CA.  
I believe the first meetings today are from 9AM to noon at the OnlyoneTV
studios.
