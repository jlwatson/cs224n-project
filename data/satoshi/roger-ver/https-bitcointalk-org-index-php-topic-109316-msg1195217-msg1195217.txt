I have repeatedly expressed to all parties that I will absolutely cooperate
fully with a receiver or a liquidator.  
  
It is genuinely my hope that everybody who is genuinely owed funds will
receive as much as possible.  
  
Until I have received competent legal advice on the matter I will not be
signing anything presented by Tihan Seale.  
  
Edit: Advice I am actively seeking.  

  
PATRICK,  
  
YOU ARE A LIAR! [/allcaps]  
  
You lied to my face in San Francisco last month, and now you are lying on the
forums.  
Stop lying, and help to return the money to the people it belongs to.  
  
Sign the document!
