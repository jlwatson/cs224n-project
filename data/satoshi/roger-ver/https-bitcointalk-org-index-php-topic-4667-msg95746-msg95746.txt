I've been reading all about bitcoins the last few nights and I am sold on the
idea.  
  
I'm proud to announce that http://www.memorydealers.com will now formally
accept bit coins.  
  
We are a decent size company with about 30 employees with expected sales
revenue of close to $10M USD for 2011  
  
If anyone needs any networking equipment, I would be happy to help, and I will
accept payment in bit coins.  
(Cisco, 3com, Foundry, Juniper, etc. We specialize in transceivers such as
GBIC, SFP+, X2, XFP etc)  
  
If anyone has any experience implementing bitcoin into a normal website
shopping cart, please contact me.  
I will have a bitcoin advertising banner on my website after our next website
update. (about 2 more weeks)  
  
If you guys are happy with my efforts, please feel free to send a few bitcoins
my way.

Please let me know if you have any other thoughts or ideas on how I can help
bitcoin grow along with my own business.
