Roger I just donated 1 bitcoin.  
  
We would be happy to setup an automated processing and receipt system for any
charity that needs it. We can give every donor a receipt for their tax
purposes, and give the charity an itemized list of all donations.  
  
Regarding the tax deduction, in the US anything you donate that has value, is
tax deductible. I give sofas and clothing to my local charity all the time,
and get a deduction for it. Especially if this "item of value" is immediately
sold for dollars, then it clearly has value.  

  
  
GREAT! Lets start contacting Charities now and get them setup with Bit-Pay or
any other Bitcoin method they are interested in.  
It is time to generate some super positive press about bitcoins!
