 **Amazon**

pays $1 billion a year in transactions fees. Amazon nets $1 billion per year.
Amazon could double their profits by doing all transactions in Bitcoin. If the
market cap for bitcoin was $38 billion, each bitcoin would be worth $5,400.  
  
 **Gambling**  
The online poker market is $4.8 billion a year industry. Online gambling will
follow poker and is a $30 billion a year industry If the market cap for
bitcoin was $30 billion, each bitcoin would be worth $4,300.

 **Gas stations**  
Credit card companies charge gas stations a 2% transaction fee. By eliminating
credit card transaction fees, gas station owners could double their profits.
The US consumes 65 billion gallons of gasoline per year. At $3.60 per gallon,
this could be a $234 billion dollars going through the bitcoin economy's per
year. If the market cap for bitcoin was $234 billion, each bitcoin would be
worth $34,400 dollars.  
  
  
 **International Remittance**  
International remittance is the transfer of money by a foreign worker to their
home country. In 2007, remittance worldwide transferred $300 billion dollars.
Western Union fees for remittance can run from about 4 percent to 20 percent
or more. If the market cap for Bitcoin was $300 billion, each bitcoin would be
worth $42,000.
