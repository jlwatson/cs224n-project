As some forum members know, you can now withdraw funds via Paypal
fromwww.bitinstant.com  
  
Paypal currently charges 3% to transfer from one paypal account to another.  
  
The Bitinstant and Paypal **COMBINED** charges are 3.29% to 3.99% for
withdrawals from MTGOX codes.  
This is only 0.29% to 0.99% more than what the standard Paypal transfer fee
would be.  
  
The problem is that users are confused into thinking that the fee will be
3.29% PLUS Paypals normal fee of 3% for a combined fee of over 6%  
  
This is not the case, but we need a clear way to convey this information to
our users.  
  
Please give us your thoughts on how we can make it clear that the TOTAL FEE
from both Bitinstant AND Paypal is only 3.29% (Just 0.29% more than what a
normal Paypal transfer would be)  
  
Please see www.bitinstant.com for our current site and let us know what should
be changed.  
  
Thank you all!
