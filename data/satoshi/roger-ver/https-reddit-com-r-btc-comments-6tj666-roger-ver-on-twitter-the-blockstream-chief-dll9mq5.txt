I think the next steps are:

* 1. Full Bitcoin Cash support by the [Bitcoin.com Wallet](https://www.bitcoin.com/choose-your-wallet/bitcoin-com-wallet).  (Support coming very soon)
* 2. Mining profitability being similar.  (This will happen after about 600 more blocks)

After those two things happen,  it will become much easier for whales to feel safe about pushing the price / mining profitability around a bit.
