"Large" is relative.  
You can buy up to $4,000 a day, per person, in the USA, Brazil, Ukraine, and
Russia through www.bitinstant.com  
  
That means each person can technically buy $1,460,000 worth of Bitcoins per
year with cash without needing to show any sort of ID.  
  
If you have one person in the USA, Russia and Brazil each depositing cash each
day, you could buy $4,380,000 worth of Bitcoins with cash each year.  
  
Is this "large" enough for you?
