The short version is that:  
  
 **Amir, Patrick and Donald of Intersango have all made this problem MUCH MUCH
WORSE by refusing to act or even reply to emails.  
Because of those three, everyone who had money in Bitcoinca will receive back
less money than they would have, had they been cooperative.**  
  
They should be ashamed.
