Isn't this the same guy who bet $10k that bitcoin would outperform gold/silver
by 100x by august of next year?  

  
Yes, that is me, and at the half way mark, Bitcoin HAS outperformed Gold and
Silver by more than 100x.

I look forward to watching things progress over the next year.

Amazon has nearly 70,000 employees --- if Roger Ver expects this to grow into
more than a novelty shop, he will need investors.  

There are already more than 15,000 employees ready to ship every single order
that comes through Bitcoinstore.com  
I don't need any investors, just some diligent people to polish off the site.  
  
Bitcoin is currently in a chicken & egg problem, but Bitcoinstore.com is one
more step to bring the needed infrastructure into place to make bitcoins easy
for everyone to use.
