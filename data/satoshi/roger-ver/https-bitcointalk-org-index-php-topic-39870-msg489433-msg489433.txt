I just made a major announcement for this, in a new topic  
  
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40137.0  
  

  
Excellent work!  
  
But does this mean, that every donated bitcoin is immediately sold on some
exchange? That would mean if someone donates a large amount, it will crash the
bitcoin price.  
  

  
I believe the charity will be able to choose what percent to keep in Bitcoins
or exchange for a legacy currency.  
As Bitcoins become more and more popular, I suspect they will keep more and
more of their Bitcoins in Bitcoins.
