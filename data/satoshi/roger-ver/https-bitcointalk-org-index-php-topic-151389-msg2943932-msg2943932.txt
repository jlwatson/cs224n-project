1\. i got a store credit(Garrett 4448) ($44.48), and only spent part of it(39
bucks). then the rest of it just dissapeared i guess. also it wouldn't let me
use the coupon for shipping i had to pay that separate.  

  
We are working on these issues.  
For now, we have sent you another coupon code for the remainder of your
credit.
