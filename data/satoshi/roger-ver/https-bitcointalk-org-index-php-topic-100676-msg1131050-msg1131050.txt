Where are you holding these Bitcoin seminars, Roger? Who is the audience? They
look awesome!  

  
We are actually having the meetings all over Japan, from Okinawa to Sapporo,
and everywhere in between.  
The people attending the meetings are investors interested in new businesses
and technologies.  
They are all excited about Bitcoin as soon as they hear about it and
understand the basics.  
I think we will start seeing a lot of Japanese investing money into Bitcoins
and starting to use Bitcoin in their existing businesses.  
They are particularly excited about the Bitinstant Bitcoin based credit card.  
Last night there was talk about being able to sell tens of thousands of them
in Japan easily.  
  
I will update this thread as things progress.
