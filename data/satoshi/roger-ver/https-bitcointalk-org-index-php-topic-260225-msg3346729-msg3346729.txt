Based on the below conversation with Patrick Strateman / Phantomcircut, I'm
happy to do whatever everyone thinks is best.  
I think it is clear that Patrick can't be trusted to do what he says though.  
  
[10/1/13 3:14:55 AM] Patrick Strateman: Hello roger  
[10/1/13 3:15:03 AM] Patrick Strateman: I have a simple question for you  
[10/1/13 3:15:10 AM] Patrick Strateman: are you in the us or japan at the
moment?  
[10/1/13 3:19:47 AM] Patrick Strateman: It would be a very good idea to answer
this simple question  
[10/1/13 3:20:15 AM] Patrick Strateman: if i do not receive an answer within
24 hours i will have no choice but to take action  
[10/1/13 3:20:58 AM] Roger Ver: What are you implying?  
[10/1/13 3:23:04 AM] Roger Ver: Why have you been promsing to turn over the
passwords to the liquidators, but never actually fufilling your promise?  
[10/1/13 3:24:45 AM] Patrick Strateman: I was, at a point, prepared to turn
over the passwords to Mr McCullagh. However his statements regarding the
specifics of how he wishes to receive the information left me with extreme
reservations  
[10/1/13 3:25:25 AM] Roger Ver: Can you tell me the details of what caused the
reservations?  
[10/1/13 3:25:47 AM] Patrick Strateman: He asked to receive them over email
with no security precautions taken.  
[10/1/13 3:26:02 AM] Patrick Strateman: I would have been remiss in providing
them in such a manner  
[10/1/13 3:26:22 AM] Patrick Strateman: For reasons which I assume are obvious  
[10/1/13 3:26:32 AM] Roger Ver: I think I agree. If he provides you with a PGP
key, you are still willing to send him the passwords?  
[10/1/13 3:28:08 AM] Patrick Strateman: His attitude towards the passwords in
question has made the handover -- even under otherwise secure conditions--
questionable.  
[10/1/13 3:28:33 AM] Patrick Strateman: I remain only interested in a
resolution to the current situation to the benefit of all parties.  
[10/1/13 3:30:09 AM] Roger Ver: At the end of the day, I don't think it is
your problem if the liquidator screws up with password security, and Mark at
MTGOX has told me that the accounts are locked down, so even if someone does
present the passwords, it will take Mark's manual approval to release any
funds. So even sending the passwords via a plane text email would still likely
be secure enough.  
[10/1/13 3:30:47 AM] Roger Ver: If you have other ideas, I am happy to hear
them.  
[10/1/13 3:34:47 AM] Patrick Strateman: Mr McCullagh made a remarkably similar
statment as to the transfer of passwords.  
[10/1/13 3:35:33 AM] Patrick Strateman: His suggestion that the use of
"dropbox" is acceptable or reasonable or in the best interest of creditors is
however entirely contradictory to the general sentiment.  
[10/1/13 3:35:54 AM] Patrick Strateman: (If you're wonding yes he actually
suggested that the credentials be relayed via DropBox(tm))  
[10/1/13 3:36:44 AM] Patrick Strateman: At this point I cannot within reason
produce credentials to a NZ liquidator whom I have serisous misgivings about
while being sued under US law.  
[10/1/13 3:36:59 AM] Patrick Strateman: I once again assume you can understand
the dilema I face.  
[10/1/13 3:38:00 AM] Roger Ver: If I were in your shoes, I would send him the
passwords by whatever insecure method he wants, and be done with it. I've
already told you we will drop the law suit as soon as you turn over the
passwords to the liquidator.  
[10/1/13 3:38:23 AM] Roger Ver: If you refuse, it just wastes more time and
money for everyone involved.  
[10/1/13 3:39:04 AM] Patrick Strateman: But can you force jesse powell to
comply with those terms? You yourself implied that this was entirely his
doing.  
[10/1/13 3:39:35 AM] Patrick Strateman: excuse me there is a typo let me fix
that  
[10/1/13 3:40:22 AM] Roger Ver: I'm 99% sure the other parties will agree to
drop the lawsuit as well once you turn over the passwords. They told me
previously that is all they want as well.  
[10/1/13 3:41:22 AM] Roger Ver: You could also Fedex the liqudator a USB drive
with the passwords in a truecrypt container, and then email him the password
after he confirms reciept. That would be a bit more secure than email alone.  
[10/1/13 3:41:43 AM] Patrick Strateman: Unfortunately for both you and me I
have serious misgivings about mr powells statements given that he has now
employed council who knowingly is committing perjury.  
[10/1/13 3:42:02 AM] Roger Ver: Can you explain what you mean by that?  
[10/1/13 3:42:26 AM] Patrick Strateman: Every case management statement has
denied that Bitcoinica LP is in bankruptcy  
[10/1/13 3:42:47 AM] Patrick Strateman: those statements are not only false
but hilariously provably false  
[10/1/13 3:42:59 AM] Patrick Strateman: I wish to seek a resolution  
[10/1/13 3:43:06 AM] Patrick Strateman: but this is not the way towards that  
[10/1/13 3:43:29 AM] Patrick Strateman: I would be open and willing to a
settlement conference between yourself and tihan  
[10/1/13 3:43:35 AM] Patrick Strateman: jesse need not attend  
[10/1/13 3:44:06 AM] Patrick Strateman: i cannot speak for tihan so i do not
know if he would be willing  
[10/1/13 3:44:08 AM] Roger Ver: I'm not a lawyer, so I don't have a legal
opinion in regards to that, but I am sure the lawyer is not intentionaly
commiting purgery and risking his law licence over this case.  
[10/1/13 3:44:42 AM] Roger Ver: I think the settlement offer hasn't changed.
Just turn over the passwords to the liquidator, and the lawsuit will be
dropped.  
[10/1/13 3:45:35 AM] Roger Ver: If you would like, I can check with the rest
of the creditors and see if there is some other settlement they would like to
see happen. Ultimately, only a portion of the funds belongs to me, so input
should be in proportion to the amount owed.  
[10/1/13 3:47:19 AM] Roger Ver: By not turning over the passwords to the
liquidator, you have substantially run up the liquidation bill. That will
directly result in the creditors receiving less money back.  
[10/1/13 3:47:42 AM] Patrick Strateman: Mr McCullagh took no action for over 6
months.  
[10/1/13 3:47:50 AM] Roger Ver: I think everyone involved just wants to get
their share of the money back, and have the entire mess be over.  
[10/1/13 3:48:00 AM] Patrick Strateman: the work was deligated to a non-
partner who took minimal actions  
[10/1/13 3:48:18 AM] Roger Ver: The liquidators have been asking for you to
turn over the passwords for 6 months.  
[10/1/13 3:48:24 AM] Patrick Strateman: My requirements of Mr McCullagh were
reasonable and necessary  
[10/1/13 3:48:27 AM] Roger Ver: Without the passwords, there isn't anything
they can do.  
[10/1/13 3:48:43 AM] Patrick Strateman: only within the last few weeks has he
come even close to meeting those requirements  
[10/1/13 3:48:45 AM] Roger Ver: If he provides you with a PGP key, will you
send him the passwords?  
[10/1/13 3:49:46 AM] Patrick Strateman: To say that the liquidators have been
asking for the passwords for over 6 months is to be exceptionally
disingenuous.  
[10/1/13 3:49:57 AM] Roger Ver: Please explain.  
[10/1/13 3:49:58 AM] Patrick Strateman: The accounts in question are held by
third parties.  
[10/1/13 3:50:07 AM] Patrick Strateman: Mr McCullagh was told this  
[10/1/13 3:50:23 AM] Patrick Strateman: he did absolutely nothing to secure
the companies assets  
[10/1/13 3:50:36 AM] Patrick Strateman: let me say that again so im entirely
sure you understand  
[10/1/13 3:51:03 AM] Patrick Strateman: mr mccullagh the liquidator of
bitcoinica lp took no action for over a 8 months to secure the assets of the
company in liquidation  
[10/1/13 3:51:11 AM] Patrick Strateman: none  
[10/1/13 3:51:32 AM] Roger Ver: What do you mean by "secure the assets"?  
[10/1/13 3:51:44 AM] Patrick Strateman: only now that the approximately 80,000
USD in assets held by Core Credit LTD has been exhausted is he taking action  
[10/1/13 3:52:41 AM] Roger Ver: Should I be thanking you for that?  
[10/1/13 3:53:17 AM] Roger Ver: Please list the specific things you want in
order to turn over the passwords to the liquidator.  
[10/1/13 3:54:48 AM] Patrick Strateman: Mr McCullagh's actions have harmed me
more so than you or any of the other creditors  
[10/1/13 3:55:15 AM] Patrick Strateman: I think we can both agree that I
personally have the most to lose by the liquidation failing to come to
completion.  
[10/1/13 3:56:06 AM] Roger Ver: I dissagree. The liqudiators spending money
because of your delays hurts me, and the rest of the creditors who have to pay
for it. It doesn't cost you anything. Please list the specific things you want
in order to turn over the passwords to the liquidator.  
[10/1/13 3:57:03 AM] Patrick Strateman: excuse me i have urgent business to
attend to I will return as soon as reasonably possible  
[10/1/13 3:59:40 AM] Patrick Strateman: As I am sure you're aware the cost of
procedings in the US far exceeds liquidators fees as yet.  
[10/1/13 4:01:14 AM] Roger Ver: When you are ready, please list the specific
things you want in order to turn over the passwords to the liquidator.  
[10/1/13 4:02:23 AM] Patrick Strateman: As I said previously I am willing to
enter into settlement negotiations with yourself and Tihan.  
[10/1/13 4:02:49 AM] Roger Ver: Tihan and I get along great, I am happy to
talk with him any time.  
[10/1/13 4:03:24 AM] Roger Ver: I'm going to relay this chat to the rest of
the creditors to see what they want as well. I hope you will chose to list
what specific things you want in order to turn over the passwords to the
liquidator.
