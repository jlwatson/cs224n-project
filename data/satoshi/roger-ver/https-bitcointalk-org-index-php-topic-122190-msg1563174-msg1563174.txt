The security error above is a real worry to me too. It seems to be similar to
the one that the Avalon website had. As I haven't seen any public statements
about this - I'm beginning to wonder if it's some sort of man-in-the-middle
attack on Bitcoin-related websites.  
  
Also.. I've been unable to login since the site update - and I have not
received any shipping info for an order placed over 10 days ago.  
I know it's a beta site - but this is almost enough to scare me back to using
'good-old' reversible credit card merchants  
  
  

  
There is no "man in the middle attack"  
We are waiting for a new SSL certificate and the error will go away.  
  
Julz, send me your order number and I can look into it for you.  
All orders are processed the same day and usually ship the very next day.
