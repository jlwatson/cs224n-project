If anything, this should make you feel MORE safe.  
I spoke with the MTgox guys a few days ago and they were very confident that
even if he was raided, everyone's bitcoins would be safe.  
They are stored somewhere off site, in a foreign country, encrypted.  
I suspect they are just they are overwhelmed by the quick growth of their
business.  
Just look at the stats. They do more than FIFTY TIMES more transactions than
all the other exchanges COMBINED!
