We are updating our billboard on the side of a VERY busy expressway in Silicon
Valley California. (Lawrence Expressway just south of Central Expressway)  
The billboard will be seen by tens of thousands of people per day.  
  
We are considering the following layout:  
  
  
  
I would like to hear the bitcoin community's thoughts on ways to improve the

Please give me any thoughts, ideas, design changes you may have.  
  
Thank you!

That design is already good it gives emphasis to bitcoin as your mode of
payment. That may attract attention to bitcoin users as well as it gives
curiosity to non-bitcoin users. FUrther it may help promote bitcoin to
passerby as your billboard is big and large enough to be seen by commuters and
passerby. Though this is a simple billboard but it will help the bitcoin
industry little by little.  

  
You are replying to a post I made in May 2011.  
The Billboard has already gone through several iterations since then.
