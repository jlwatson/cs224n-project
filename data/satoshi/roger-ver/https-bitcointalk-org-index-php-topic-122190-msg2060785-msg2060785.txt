I was just about to order something, but international shipping costs for a
0.25 BTC product seem to be ridiculously high  
  
The following options appear:  
  

Quote

1) **United States Postal Service - Priority Mail International 0.446 BTC [
$47.00 ]**  
PLEASE NOTE: Free shipping is equally as fast as paid shipping for orders over
$100.  
2) **Express Mail International 0.601 BTC [ $63.35 ]**  
PLEASE NOTE: Free shipping is equally as fast as paid shipping for orders over
$100.  
PLEASE NOTE: If your item is considered a "Large" item and needs LTL Shipping
one of our staff members will notify you in regards to an additional shipping
fee. By proceeding with the order you are agreeing to the terms.

  
And the contact form (link at the bottom) doesn't seem to work:

What is this 'free shipping' option?  

  
The "free shipping" option is for domestic orders only.  
I will update the site to remove this confusion for international orders.  
  
There is actually a 0% markup on the shipping as well.  
When you include the packaging supplies and labor, we actually lose money on
the shipping of each international order.
