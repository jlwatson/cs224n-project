Beware of other people using your accounts.  

  
I agree, but they are both trusted long term employees 5+ years who I trust.  
  
  
I am guessing that deepbit maybe susceptible to a brute force password hacking
attack.  
You seem to be able to try as many incorrect passwords on the site in a row as
you want.  
I hope they put a delay after 3 failed log in attempts.  
  
Does anyone have the contact info for the admin at deepbit?  
I am hoping they have some kind of log for whoever logged into my account.
