The commercial starts at 1:02:53  
  
And then it sparked a discussion of bitcoins for the next half hour on the
show!  
  
I imagine as long as the paid commercial runs on the show we will get lots of
free advertising by the hosts and callers discussing it.  
  
Someone please help make a 30 second recorded commercial to run as well.  
I will start it running as soon as we have it.
