Thanks for the added effort joepie91.  
  
I just tried testing it out with a 3072 Ã— 2304 image.  
  
After the upload completed it came back with the error message of: An error
occurred during upload.  
  
  
Could that be because the image is too big?  
Is there a way to make it automatically resize images that are too big?  
  
You should also put your Bitcoin donation address at the bottom of that page.  
  
Thanks!
