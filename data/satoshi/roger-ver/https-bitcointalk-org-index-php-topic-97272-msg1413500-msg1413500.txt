This is a lie that has been pushed by Roger Ver who is an owner in businesses
who are direct competitors with Intersango.  
  
Let me repeat. It's a lie.  

  
I don't think I ever said either of those things, and I'm not a part owner of
any active bitcoin exchange that would be considered a direct competitor to
you.  
  
You do however owe me around 24,000 BTC and have been rather rude about it.
