I need to hire a Linux based System administrator to configure a webserver for
a special project I am working on.  
  
This is the system:

Intel-2-8GHz-Hex-Core-48GB-
RAM-/200751181735?pt=COMP_EN_Servers&hash=item2ebdb3efa7#ht_2429wt_1377  
  
The preferred OS is Gentoo (64bit), but any other version of Linux would still
be ok.  
  
Depending on your skill set this could become a full time position helping
with various Bitcoin related projects.  
  
Please contact roger at memorydealers.com  
  
I can pay in USD or BTC.
