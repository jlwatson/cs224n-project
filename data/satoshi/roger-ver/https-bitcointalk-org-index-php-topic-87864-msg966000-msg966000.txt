I need to hire a Linux based System administrator to configure a webserver for
a special project I am working on.

This is the system:

The preferred OS is Gentoo (64bit), but any other version of Linux would still
be ok.

Depending on your skill set this could become a full time position helping
with various Bitcoin related projects.

Please contact

I can pay in USD or BTC.
