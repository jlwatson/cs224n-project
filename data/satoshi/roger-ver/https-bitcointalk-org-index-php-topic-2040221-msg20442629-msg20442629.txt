We are enabling Bitcoin Cash mining because we have sold millions of dollars
worth of hash rate to our customers.  
That hash rate belongs to them, not us. Since so many of them have asked to be
able to mine Bitcoin Cash with their hash rate, we will let them do what they
want with their own property. Bitcoin.com as an entity intends to follow
through with the Segwit2X agreement.  
Per our announcement, if the 2X part of that agreement does not come in time,
we will be putting all of our efforts behind the chain that is most inline
with the bitcoin outlined in the Satoshi White Paper. Currently that seems to
be Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Unlimited, and Bitcoin Classic.
