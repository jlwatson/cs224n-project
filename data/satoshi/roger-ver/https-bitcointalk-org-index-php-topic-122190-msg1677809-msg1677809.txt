 **I don't think they keep all their cash in bitcoins**. It'd be too risky if
the price dropped they'd loose a significant amount of money. They probably
pay all their bills and some of their employees in fiat so they always need it
on hand.  

  
You are talking about a group of people who have so much faith in bitcoin that
they've invested heavily into creating a significant online store that accepts
ONLY bitcoin as payment. Think again:  

  
Danny is exactly right.  
I have no intention of converting my Bitcoins for USD.  
  
  
Lots more big improvements to the stie will be coming soon too.
