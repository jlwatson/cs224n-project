  
Are you saying my account is not verified?  
  
1) I filled out your online claim form.  
2) You have my ID on file.  
3) I met you in person in Vienna last week.  
4) I provided my entire account history going back for months.  
  
I have yet to receive any of my Bitcoins back.  
  
Please help!
