It's time to think about how to design an easy to use Bitcoin privacy tool at
privacy.bitcoin.com

I'll be brainstorming implementation ideas and taking feedback at:

https://forum.bitcoin.com/project-development/privacy-bitcoin-com-is-coming-
soon-t1208.html

I'll likely have some sort of bounty for the best ideas as well.
