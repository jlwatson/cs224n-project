  
I'm aware of all the issues that have surfaced in regards to Bruce Wagner
since my initial post. He was in Toyko earlier this week, and I had an
informal dinner with him, and a couple other Tokyo locals who are interested
in Bitcoins. For months, every day, all day has been a Bitcoin brainstorming
session. I hope more great ideas will follow soon. I am sure this charity idea
is still a great one, and I will work to see it through.
