In tonight's Bitcoin Brainstorming session, we came up with an idea to make
sure...  
...  

  
Speaking of the brainstorming session, I'd certainly be interested to know any
details about it. I'd be surprised if a lot of others here were not as well.
Who was present, in person or via vid, was it taped, etc. That sort of thing.
It seems pretty clear that Bruce Wagner was a party and as you probably know
there are a lot of questions about his character which have surfaced since the
time of your post.  
  
Thanks!  

  
I'm aware of all the issues that have surfaced in regards to Bruce Wagner
since my initial post. He was in Toyko earlier this week, and I had an
informal dinner with him, and a couple other Tokyo locals who are interested
in Bitcoins. For months, every day, all day has been a Bitcoin brainstorming
session. I hope more great ideas will follow soon. I am sure this charity idea
is still a great one, and I will work to see it through.
