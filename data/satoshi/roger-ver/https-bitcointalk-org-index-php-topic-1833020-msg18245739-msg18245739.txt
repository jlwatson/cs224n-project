  
Great job putting words in my mouth.  
Layer two technologies will allow Bitcoin to compete with Credit Cards.  
My main point is that we shouldn't damage layer one's usability today in order
to force people onto layer two. They'll just be forced into altcoins anyhow.
(As we are seeing)  
  
BU's roadmap preserves layer one. Core's roadmap intentionally damages layer
one.  
It is clear to me which path is the safer one.
