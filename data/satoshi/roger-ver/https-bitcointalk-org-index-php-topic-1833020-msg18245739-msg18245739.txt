One thing that stands out in OP's youtube video, is Roger Ver saying he wants
bitcoin to compete with credit cards in terms of transaction speed and fees so
that "everyone can use it".  
  
That's kind of like saying he wants to make encrypted WIFI fast enough to play
video games as well as an FIOS hardline.  
  
He doesn't seem to have a plan or idea on how to achieve this.  
  
He doesn't seem to understand encryption based technologies like bitcoin will
never be as fast as credit cards, for the same reasons that encrypted WIFI
will always be much slower than using an unencrypted hardline for gaming.  
  
He seems to think that if he continues to increase block size, he'll
eventually reach a point where bitcoin can execute thousands of transactions
per second, like credit cards do.  
  
It seems like a bad plan created by a person who lacks the technical
background to be involved with making key bitcoin design decisions.  

  
Great job putting words in my mouth.  
Layer two technologies will allow Bitcoin to compete with Credit Cards.  
My main point is that we shouldn't damage layer one's usability today in order
to force people onto layer two. They'll just be forced into altcoins anyhow.
(As we are seeing)  
  
BU's roadmap preserves layer one. Core's roadmap intentionally damages layer
one.  
It is clear to me which path is the safer one.
