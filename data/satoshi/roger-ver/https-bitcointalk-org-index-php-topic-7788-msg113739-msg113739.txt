Something doesn't seem right. Someone with $50k to invest is probably smart
enough to realize they could have slowly bought over 2-3 days at a much lower
cost-average than a single market price order. Perhaps they wanted to break
the technical boundary and send a signal to the market? This is very bullish,
imo.  

  
Maybe they have a lot more than $50K that they intend to invest.  
This could be the signal to attract other sellers into the market so they can
buy a lot more.
