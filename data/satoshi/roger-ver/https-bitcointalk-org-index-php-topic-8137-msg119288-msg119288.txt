Not giving an exact figure here but the amount of funds on Britcoin are
usually 100x the volume of the market.  
  
But it varies: there was a point where we were getting 3k volume per day and
had 10k GBP, 10k BTC.  
  
Usual MtGox volume is 20k, so I'd say they likely have ~200k online.  

  
I think you are off by at least an order of magnitude, or two.  
The recent volume on MtGox has been over $200K USD per day.  
100x that would give an estimate of $20M USD in the market on Mt Gox.  
(I would guess this is high, 10x = $2M USD seems more reasonable at this time)
