  
The banner will be up there for as long as I keep paying. I suspect this will
be years and years.  
  
  
To Spendbitcoins.com, bitbrew.net, and others, I'm sorry I did not have a
chance to plug you.  
I tried to plug as many things as I could, but it is hard to remember everyone
durring a fast paced interview.  
  
I think a good next step for everyone is to visit www.freetalklive.com, take a
look at their sponsors on the right hand side of the page, see if any of them
have something you want to buy, and contact them to see if they will accept
Bitcoins as payment.  
If they agree, please be sure to actually purchase the item from them. This is
a great way to get more shops to accept Bitcoin.  
  
  
I really want the 50 caliber air-gun their sponsor sells!
