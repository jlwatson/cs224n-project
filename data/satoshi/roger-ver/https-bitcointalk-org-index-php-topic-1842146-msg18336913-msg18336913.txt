This is exactly what is happening to Bitcoin due to Core's roadmap.  
They may be expert programers, but they don't understand that Bitcoin is only

Full blocks and the high fees and backlog that they create are destroying
Bitcoin's comparative advantage and driving people to use alt coins instead.
