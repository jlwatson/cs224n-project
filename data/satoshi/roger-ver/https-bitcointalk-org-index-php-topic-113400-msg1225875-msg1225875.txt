They have something on their web page about disallowing felons. So I guess
that means no Silkroad, no BFL.  

  
Felons under whose definition?  
SR so far are no criminals under any serious objective Ethics, for example.  
  
And to reject "felons" (under whichever definition), they need to require
people to identify themselves. That's already something that I consider that
goes against bitcoin principles. I wouldn't expect that of Jon Matonis, for
example, who proudly supports financial privacy. And look who's on the
board... (PS: I haven't verified yet if they really block anonymous
memberships, I'm saying this based on what was said on this topic)  

  
As a convicted felon, I think it is important to distinguish between:  
Malum in se  
vs  
Malum prohibitum  
  
If there is no victim, there is no crime.  
People who enforce victimless crime laws are the criminal agressors and need
to stop.
