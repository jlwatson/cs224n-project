What sort of bounty is still available if I can convince the following company
to accept Bitcoins publicly on their website?  
  
Publicly traded on the Nasdaq  
Stock price currently over $40  
Market cap of over $500,000,000  
Anual sales of over $300,000,000  
Worldwide customer base.  
Would greatly benefit from accepting Bitcoins as a payment method.
