Can I ask where you get the exchange rate for Chinese Yuan?  
  
In your app it shows 1 BTC = 30.125 RMB (Currently Bitcoin is $5.04)  
But according to www.xe.com 30.125 RMB would only be $4.78 (Why is there a
$0.26 difference per bitcoin?)  
  
  
Request #2)  
Yesterday I had a meeting about Bitcoin with several people in a hotel in
China.  
We were all sharing the Hotel Wifi.  
After explaining Bitcoin, I had them install your app. The first person
installed it with little trouble.  
When the 2nd person tried to create a wallet on their laptop, an error was
given that a wallet was just created by the same IP address.  
You may want to consider lifting the restriction on the number of wallets that
can be created from the same IP address.  
Luckily my friend already had a VPN subscription so he was easily able to
change his IP address and create a wallet.  
  
  
  
Thanks for working on making such a great app!
