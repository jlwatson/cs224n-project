  
I just brought this issue to Zlatko's attention and he should get back to you
with answers to your questions.  
He has been overwhelmed with orders each day thanks to the great number of
orders from the Bitcoin community.  
We just hired another support person today (Ericson Ramirez), this Brings the
total Bitcoinstore.com team members up to six of us.  
Lots more big improvements will be coming soon!
