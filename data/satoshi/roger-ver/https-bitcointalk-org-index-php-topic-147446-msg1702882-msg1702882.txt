Hi!  
  
Yesterday I put an order in for a Western Digital 4TB External Hard Drive. I
put the order in without registering an account. The website said the item was
out of stock but I put the order in anyway because it's an easy way for me to
cash out my BTC. I sent in a support ticket asking about when it will be in
stock, shipping time (I'm in New Jersey, USA), tracking info etc. I get a
response from Zlatko telling me you can't mail to a P.O. Box and need my
physical address. That's fine so I responded with my physical address. The
problem is that he didn't answer any of my questions about the item being
in/out of stock, shipping time, tracking info etc. Along with including my
physical address in the response I also re-asked these questions. It has been
24 hours and I have received no response. My order number is 100000567. I will
appreciate a response soon. I need these questions answered so I know when to
be home to wait for the package. I hate when I miss a package!  
  
Kind Regards,  
  
Michael  
  
Update: I just received a response from Zlatko saying the order has been
submitted. He totally ignored all of my questions. Could somebody please help
me?  

  
I just brought this issue to Zlatko's attention and he should get back to you
with answers to your questions.  
He has been overwhelmed with orders each day thanks to the great number of
orders from the Bitcoin community.  
We just hired another support person today (Ericson Ramirez), this Brings the
total Bitcoinstore.com team members up to six of us.  
Lots more big improvements will be coming soon!
