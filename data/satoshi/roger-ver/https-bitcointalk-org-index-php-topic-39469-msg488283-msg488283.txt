Hi Roger,  
  
Thank you for your enquiry.  
  
Unfortunately we don't list virtual 'currencies' in our services. If Bitcoin
becomes a globally accepted standard, is traded openly on the currency
markets, is assigned an ISO4217 currency code by the ISO and there are
multiple and available rate sources, we may decide to include it in our
services but we don't have any plans to do so at present.  
  
Thank you for your interest in our company and services.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
XE Currency Services Team  

  
I suppose now we should try contacting the ISO4217 people about bitcoins.
