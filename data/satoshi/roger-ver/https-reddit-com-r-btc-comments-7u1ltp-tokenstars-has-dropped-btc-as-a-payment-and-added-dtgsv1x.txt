TokenStars previously only accepted ETH and BTC.  They recently contacted me wanting me to donate something to be auctioned off, so I told them they must accept BCH in order for me to participate, and now they do! You can also bid in BCH for a "BCH PLS" T-shirt signed by me.  The proceeds will be donated to the Mises Institute.
