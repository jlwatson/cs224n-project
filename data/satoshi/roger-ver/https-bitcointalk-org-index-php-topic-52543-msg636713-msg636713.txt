 **REQUEST!**  
  
Since I haven't heard from Roger or Gavin, I need somebody that the community
trusts at large to have control of a Bitcoin wallet address, at least until
that position is maintain by an individual full time in the very near future.
I've already stated that I will not be in charge of the funds because, quite
frankly, I WILL SPEND IT ON OLD MUSTY SMELLING LUMBER. A volunteer or drafting
a willing person is what I'm requesting. This may be a fine position for a
woman in filling. Remember that thread on how to get woman on board? Only any
obscure thought. But, come to think of it, a person in charge of making the
decisions at these charitable organizations may be more prone to agree to our
offer if a woman made the presentation. Hmmm!  
  
  
  

  
  
Sorry I didn't notice any of this sooner.  
I've been busy with other Bitcoin stuff.  
  
I am willing to be the custodian of the funds if needed.  
  
For the fastest replies, anyone can email me at roger@memorydealers.com
