The part that I dont think I did a good enough job of conveying over twitter
and in the media is that the Barbados embassy was behaving insanely during the
interview process. They were denying my visa, claiming that I hadnt shown
sufficient ties out side of the USA, while I was begging them to let me show
them. I had a whole stack of paperwork proving my 9 year history in Japan,
including a business since 2006 with multiple employees. They literally
refused to even look at the paperwork. They wouldnt even let me slide it
through the slot in their window for them to review. They had the nerve to
claim that I hadnt proved sufficient ties to a country outside of the USA,
while literally refusing to even look at the proof I was offering.  
They did this same thing three separate times over eight days. It felt like
something out of the Twilight Zone.
