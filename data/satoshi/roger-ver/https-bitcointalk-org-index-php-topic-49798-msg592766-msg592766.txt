As as American who has lived in Japan for about 6 years and speaks Japanese
fluently, I can tell you that Japnese are VERY conservative when it comes to
money. I organized a Bitcoin meetup group in Tokyo recently.

Only foreigners showed up.  
  
Most Japanese still have a recent Japanese digital currency fresh in their
minds.  
It failed, and investors lost billions of dollars.

I suspect Bitcoin adoption may be slow in Japan, but I am doing everything I
can to speed things up.  
  
I launched www.bitcoin.co.jp a few months ago.  
  
The few, technical Japanese I have spoken with in person about bitcoins seem
to get it, but it will take time.
