@Roger: You mention on the page that you eventually want BBH to be
distributed... Have you considered talking to the OpenBazaar devs to see if
you can get it included into that software? I've seen the beta; this thing
could replace amazon & the Silk Road both someday.  

  
I'm very interested in and supportive of OpenBazaar.  
I'm confident distributed hosting of some sort will be available within the
next few years.  
Currently I'm trying to figure out a way to make the payouts trustless using
something like http://realitykeys.com/
