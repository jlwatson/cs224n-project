Nice. Just curious, what is the relationship between MemoryDealers.com and
exchangebitcoins.com? Are you just buying advertising for them for free, or do
you own a stake in this exchange? Obviously its none of my business but like I
said, curious.  

  
I don't have any direct relationship with exchangebitcoins.com other than I
met them at the NYC Bitcoin conference.  
  
I'm just a fan of Bitcoins and how I think they will change the world.  
I want to do everything I can to make those changes come sooner rather than
later.  
  
  
I'm just as happy to pay for a radio ad for mtgox, or ruxum or any other
Bitcoin business that I think would benefit.  
  
I chose exchangebitcoins.com because of their ability to take cash deposits.  
I suspect that will appeal to a lot of people around the country.  
  
  
If you have an idea for any other great ads, please post them here. Lets make
it happen!
