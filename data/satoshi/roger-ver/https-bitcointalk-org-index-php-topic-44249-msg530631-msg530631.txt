Its Hooters! 468 locations..  

  
Someone please photoshop bitcoins into the hooters logo!  
  
This would be the perfect combination.  
I hope it is true!  

By request:  
  

  
Thank you so much!  
  
I love it, and my girl friend is pissed because I may soon have a reason to go
to Hooters every day for lunch!
