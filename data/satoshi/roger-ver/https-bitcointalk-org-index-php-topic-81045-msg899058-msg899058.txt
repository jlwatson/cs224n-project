I think everyone should keep in mind that the real person/group to be angry
with is the hackers, not Bitcoinica.  
Anyone who is smart enough to figure out how to steal 18K BTC from Bitcoinica
is more than smart enough to do honest work. I hope Zhou goes on to have a
long successful career while the hackers and other thieves burn in hell.  
  
 **Direct your anger towards the hackers!**  

  
Anger towards the hackers is certainly appropriate but (assuming here the bank
is not insured) if your bank had a back door made only of plate glass and left
the vault open, allowing a thief to run off with your money, some anger
towards said bank would also be appropriate. Especially if they allowed it to
happen twice.  
  
One could certainly also lay blame on those who re-deposited money they
couldn't afford to lose in said bank after the first incident (even if the
bank did reimburse them the first time).  
  
  

  
Because **no money was lost by customers last time** , and **no money will be
lost by customers this time** , there is NO REASON to be angry at Bitcoinica.
