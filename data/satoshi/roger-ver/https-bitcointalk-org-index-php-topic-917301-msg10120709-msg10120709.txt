I would like to point out a few more things:  
  
1\. The law states I only need to have ties to a country outside of the USA.
It doesn't need to be my country of citizenship.  
  
2\. In addition to 9 years of history with Japan, I already have strong ties
to St Kitts at this point. In St Kitts, I bought a substantial amount of real
estate, have local friends, started my own local business, and have
participated deeply with other local businesses.
