For sure the volume has greatly increased since last year - but nothing has
dramatically changed very recently (was actually a little surprised that the
"memorydealers" visit seemingly had no effect this time when last time it
caused a huge jump in volume).  
  

  
I actually wasn't able to go earlier this moth as I had planned.  
I'm sure I will make another visit to China again soon.
