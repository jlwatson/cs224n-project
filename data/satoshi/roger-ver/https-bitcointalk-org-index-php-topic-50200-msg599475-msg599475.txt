  
I disagree,  
I think the premium on the 25BTC coin is not too bad. (About 12% over the
current ask price)  
There is free shipping anywhere inside the USA, so considering the paypal fees
and chargeback risk, this seems very reasonable.  
  
The fact that we sold around 1,000 coins in the first few days means lots of
other people agree.  
  
Please give it a try:
