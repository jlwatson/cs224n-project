@BTCSports,  
Since I think you know a lot more about how betting works than I do, I would
like your input on how to structure the bet.  
  
I am saying that Bitcoin will outperform ALL of them.  
  
How I imagine it would work is if the current (easy math) price of each is:  
Bitcoin is $10.  
Silver is $50  
Gold is $1500  
Dow Jones 10,000 points  
Nasdaq 2,000 points  
USD is $1  
  
in two years if everything doubles (except the USD will still be worth $1USD)
to:  
  
Silver is $100  
Gold is $300  
Dow Jones 20,000 points  
Nasdaq 4,000 points  
  
Bitcoins would need to be more than 100x more ($1,000 a coin) for me to win
the bet.  
  
Please let me know if anything is not clear, or you think I am missing
something.
