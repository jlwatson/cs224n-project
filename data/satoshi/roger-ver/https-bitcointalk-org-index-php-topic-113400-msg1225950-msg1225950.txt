  
In reality, I ran for California state assembly in 2000 as a Libertarian /
Voluntarist.  
I said enough to upset the feds so much that I became the only person in the
USA to be prosecuted for selling a legal product  
that was also being sold by hundreds of other companies across the USA
including http://www.cabelas.com/  
http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/press-releases/2002/verPlea.htm  
There is no freedom of speech.  
This is why the world needs Bitcoin, and this is why I support
bitcoinfoundation.org
