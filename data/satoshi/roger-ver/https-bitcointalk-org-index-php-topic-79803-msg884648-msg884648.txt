Myself and Yifu Guo (of www.bitsyn.com) will be in Shenzhen until Thursday May
10th.  
  
I am planning to organize a meeting about Bitcoin with local businesses I know
in the Shenzhen area.  
  
Some of the attendees will include companies with hundreds of employees and
anual revenue over $100M USD.  
  
It would be helpful to have additional native Chinese speakers who already
understand Bitcoin.  
  
  
If you are interested, please contact me at roger@memorydealers.com  
  
Please repost this message on any Chinese Language Bitcoin message boards.  
  
Thank you,  
  
Roger Ver
