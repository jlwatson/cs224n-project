As an online merchant who is trying to deal with these exact issues, I would
like to offer a few thoughts.  
  
1\. I think it will be quite some time before items are priced ONLY in BTC. I
think most merchants will list their prices in USD, EUR, Yen, RMB etc and ALSO
be willing to accept BTC at the current exchange rate at the time of sale.  
  
2\. To deal with the wild exchange rate fluctuations merchants have three main
options:  
A. Hold onto the BTC in the hopes the value will increase further.  
B. Find another merchant to spend the BTC to.  
C. Exchange them immediately for a national currency.  
  
I suspect "C" will be the most common. With a little programming a system can
be setup to calculate the required amount of BTC required at the time of sale.  
In fact, bitcoincharts.com has a wonderful calculator that would allow a
merchant to calculate how many bitcoins they would need to sell to receive the
required amount of USD.  
See here:  
  
  
  
With a little programming, I am sure an automated system can be setup where
the merchant can sell their bitcoins for the expected amount of national
currency as soon as they receive the payment. The sooner people can develop
software to do this for common shopping cart programs such as Magento and Open
cart, the sooner major merchants will begin accepting bitcoins as payment.
