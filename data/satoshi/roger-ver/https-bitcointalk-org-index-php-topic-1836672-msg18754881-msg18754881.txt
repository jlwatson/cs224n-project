As of this moment, Loaded still has not contacted in any way despite my asking
him to, and providing all of my personal contact details.  
I think it is fair to say that Loaded has backed out, or never had any
intention of going through with the deal in the first place.  
  
Meanwhile, Greg Maxwell and others are going around spreading the lie that
I've backed out of this deal.  
  
 **Loaded, I'm still waiting to hear from you!**
