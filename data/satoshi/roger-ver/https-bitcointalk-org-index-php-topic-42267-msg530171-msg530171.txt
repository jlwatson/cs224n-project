  
In a free market, Zhoutong is not the king of Bitcoin, but **he IS the king of
Bitcoinica**.  
  
He can ban, or allow, anyone to use the site for whatever reason he pleases.  
  
Just as the rest of us can decide to use, or not use, Bitcoinica for whatever
reason we please.  
  
This is the only moral and fair system of property rights.
