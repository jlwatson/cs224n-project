I just sent the following email:  
  
Hello,  
  
 _I was looking athttp://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising  
  
and I would like to make a $1,000.00 donation via Bitcoins.  
I'm sure lots of other people all around the world are also interested in
donating via bit coins.  
  
Tony at www.Bit-Pay.com can set everything up for you so that people can
donate via bit coins, and you can receive a wire for USD in your Bank account
the very next day after each bit coin donation.  
  
Please let me know if you have any questions, or if there is anything else I
can do to help,_  
  
  
$1,000 isn't a huge amount of money, but hopefully it is enough to make them
at least consider it.
