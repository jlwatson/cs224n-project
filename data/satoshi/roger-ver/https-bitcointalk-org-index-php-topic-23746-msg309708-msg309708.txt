As I write this from inside China, and as someone who does a lot of business
with factories in China, I can tell you that there IS A LOT OF INTEREST in
bitcoins by these factory owners.  
I can also tell you that many of them are willing to accept partial payment in
Bitcoins for their orders.  
  
There is a lot of discussion on chinese message boards about bitcoins, and as
the word spreads, I suspect they will become more and more popular in China.
