Good to hear. I really would have loved to have made it. I am just getting off
an all night shoot and I'm in Queens so I don't know if it's possible to make
it there since you're only going till 12pm today. I have a nice 4G streaming
setup from a laptop with livestream on http://blackout.com I coulda put up.
Are you guys still going to O'Crepes? I think I am closer to that. In any case
it seems a lot is happening for bitcoin. I look forward to seeing some of the
interviews and next time getting involved earlier.

I doubt we are going to o'crepes for lunch.  
It is kind of far.  
Lots of us are still at the onlyoneTV studios and the talks are going strong.  
Come on over!
