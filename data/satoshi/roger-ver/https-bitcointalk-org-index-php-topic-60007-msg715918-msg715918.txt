From what I have just read, it looks like #SPON is being forced on us by the
FTC, not by twitter.  
I wish the FTC would allow people to tweet whatever they please.  

  
Source?  

  
Here are a few:

 _The F.T.C. said that beginning on Dec. 1, bloggers who review products must
disclose any connection with advertisers, including, in most cases, the
receipt of free products and whether or not they were paid in any way by
advertisers, as occurs frequently._

uk-says/  
  
Obviously the FTC thinks they own the world.  
I think I will start a new feedzebirds campaign that says something like:  
  
 _The #FTC threatens people with violence if they don't include #spon in their
tweets.  
Abolish the #FTC_  
  
I wish they would find honest work, and let free people be free.
