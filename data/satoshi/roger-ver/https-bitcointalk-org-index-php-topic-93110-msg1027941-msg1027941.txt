Please help me.  
I have **24,841 bitcoins** on deposit with Bitcoinica.  
 **I have provided them with my full and complete account history including
every transaction since day one.  
** There is no question as to exactly how much I am owed. (I'm happy to
provide proof to other trusted entities)  
I have patiently been asking for them for my money back for months, but they
have refused to return even a single Bitcoin to me.  
  
I'm a core Bitcoin proselytizer.  
I'm responsible partly or in full for:

National Bitcoin radio adds @ $2,800 a month for over the last year.  
The Bitcoin Bet.  
Bitcoin Billboard  
Numerous national radio interviews.  
Several more projects that are in the works including a Bitcoin competitor to
newegg.com.  
  
For the last 1.5 years I have spent every waking moment promoting Bitcoin, and
my 24,841 Bitcoins were to be used exactly for that.  
  
Hacker, Tihan, Zhou, Patrick, Donald, Amir, or anyone else with access to my
money, please return it to  
16HMoS4TryH7wWsAv2PtvxiHX8QGXMGczi  
  
so that I can continue to effectively promote Bitcoin.  
Returning my funds will likely make everyone's worth even more in the long
run.  
I promise I will continue using them to help advance Bitcoin.
