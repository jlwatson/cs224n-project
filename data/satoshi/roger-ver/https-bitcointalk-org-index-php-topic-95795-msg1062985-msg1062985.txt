Zhou,  
  
Please check with the hacker to see if he can return a copy of the database in
addition to the stolen funds.  
This would solve just about all the current difficulties.  
  
Please help!  

  
It is assumed that Chen Jianhai was an opportunist, due to the recent leak of
source code, not part of the first group of hackers who destroyed bitcoinica.  

  
With the way this soap opera is unfolding, you never know.  
  
Zhou, please see what you can do to get a copy of the database!
