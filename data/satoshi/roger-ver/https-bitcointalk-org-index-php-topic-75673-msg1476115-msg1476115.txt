You can install it from any app store. (Not only Korean)  
If you install it from an IP address that already has accessed a
Blockchain.info wallet that is more than two weeks old, the iphone app will
have the full wallet functionality enabled.  

Do you have to install it, or just run it from an IP address?  

  
I think install, but it is easy to delete the app and reinstall it.  
  
Here is an old Blockchain account that you can use to activate the Iphone app:
