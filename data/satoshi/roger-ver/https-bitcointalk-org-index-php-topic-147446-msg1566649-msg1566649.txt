  
It is about $850K needed total per quarter to maintain the contract.  
Currently we are about $50K of the way there. (I'm not planning to cash out
the coins if possible)  
  
I'm aware that the site isn't actually ready yet and still needs a lot of
polishing, but I was running out of time to meet my sales quota for Q1 of
2013.  
  
I hope the Bitcoin community can come together to help buy a lot of stuff.  
This will help Bitcoinstore continue to improve and maintain the supplier
contract into the future.
