That is great, thanks! So, is that 850k in addition to the current balance,
the total received, or from today onward?  
  
So, are you guys not cashing out immediately on receiving payment? It looks
like most of the balance is still there. If you're staying in BTC as long as
possible, that's ballsy as hell (and kind of awesome.)  
  

  
It is about $850K needed total per quarter to maintain the contract.  
Currently we are about $50K of the way there. (I'm not planning to cash out
the coins if possible)  
  
I'm aware that the site isn't actually ready yet and still needs a lot of
polishing, but I was running out of time to meet my sales quota for Q1 of
2013.  
  
I hope the Bitcoin community can come together to help buy a lot of stuff.  
This will help Bitcoinstore continue to improve and maintain the supplier
contract into the future.
