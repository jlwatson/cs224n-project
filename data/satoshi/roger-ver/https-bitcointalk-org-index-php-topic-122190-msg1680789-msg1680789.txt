Danny is exactly right.  
I have no intention of converting my Bitcoins for USD.  

I fear you may of have travelled too far back in time. Dont get me wrong I
personally love this, but we are still quite some time away from your
suppliers accepting bitcoin, correct ?  

  
The current supplier for Bitcoinstore.com doesn't accept Bitcoins yet, but I
intend to try to change that.
