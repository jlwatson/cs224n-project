Earlier today I discovered www.mokimarket.com  
  
Some ideas came to mind on how to make this a HUGE TOOL TO EXPAND THE USE OF
BITCOIN!  
  
Mokimarket is a penny auction site using credits that can be bought with
Paypal, CC, or Bitcoin.  
Each "credit" basically represents $0.01 of value.  
  
Bidders spend a credit to place each bid on an auction.  
The seller keeps all of the "credits" used for placing the bids, plus the
money for the actual sale.  
  
For example, the final bid might be $75, but in reality hundreds of dollars
were collected by the seller durring the auction process.  
  
If MokiMarket were to use BitCents instead of credits, it would be an amazing
way for people to buy sell whatever they want using bitcoins, and for new
people to get Bitcoins without using a traditional exchange!  
  
Every user would have their own online wallet with MokiMarket.  
Each time a user bids on an auction, MokiMarket will transfer one Bitcent from
the bidders wallet to the sellers wallet.  
  
Just add an Ebay style feedback system, and a section for "buy it now" items,
and it would allow MokiMarket to function as a giant web-of-trust for people
who want to buy and sell Bitcoins for government currencies as well.  
  
I think this could be hugely popular.  
  
Please share your thoughts.
