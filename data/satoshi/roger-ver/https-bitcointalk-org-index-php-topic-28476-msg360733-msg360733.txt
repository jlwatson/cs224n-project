@ Codemojo,  
  
Thanks for getting it up so quick!

Can we add a bit better instructions for the input page?  
I want to make it easy enough for my mother to use.  
  
I imagine that the text could read:  
  
 _This website will easily allow anyone to accept bitcoins at their store.  
  
All you need to do is:  
1\. Upload your company logo and text. (optional)  
2\. Enter the Bitcoin address that you would like to RECEIVE payments to.  
3\. Print the resulting form, and display it prominently in your checkout
area.  
_  
  
  
If anyone else has additional ideas or comments, please let us know!
