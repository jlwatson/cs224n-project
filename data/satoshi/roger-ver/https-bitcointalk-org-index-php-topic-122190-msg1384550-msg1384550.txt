This is what I get when I add shipping & tax estimate... is there no tax b/c
you're shipping across state lines?  

  
Until the law changes, we are only required to charge tax in CA, TN, and MA.  
  
I may be able to move the business outside of CA at some point and eliminate
the need for Sales tax in CA as well.
