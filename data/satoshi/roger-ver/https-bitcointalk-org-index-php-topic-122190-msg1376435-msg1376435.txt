The menu on the site is outright unusable. Worst menu on any store I've used
recently.  

  
This will be fixed shortly, and the $1,000 minimum will be removed soon too.  
  
One of the issues causing the delay is properly calculating the sales tax for
the various states, and counties within each state.  
Just one more example of politicians making the world a poorer place than it
otherwise would be.
