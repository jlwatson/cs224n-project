I will be getting married this year, and will need to buy a diamond ring.  
I've decided that this is a good opportunity to bring more companies on board
with Bitcoin.  
  
My fianc√© agreed to allow me to buy the ring with Bitcoins, with the condition
that I have it by the end of ~~March~~ April 2012.  
That day is quickly approaching, so I need the Bitcoin community's help to
make this happen.  
  
Bitcoins are a perfect fit for online retailers of Diamonds.  
Diamonds are a commodity that can easily be resold, and are not traceable, and
are therefore a common target for thieves using stolen credit card numbers.  
Bitcoin removes all of these risks.  
  
My initial goal was to get www.bluenile.com to accept Bitcoins as payment
directly on their website.  
BlueNile.com is the worlds largest online diamond retailer.  
They are a publicly traded company with annual revenue of around $350M USD.  
  
In several emails with Blue Nile, I have promised to buy a ring of at least
$50,000 USD from them if they publicly accept Bitcoins on their website.  
They have shown some interest, but have not given any kind of firm commitment
yet.  
  
I'm hoping that with some additional interest from the Bitcoin community, we
can convince them to accept Bitcoins directly on their website.  
  
If you agree with this idea, please contact them to let them know you would
also like them to accept Bitcoins as payment.

Your request will be even more influential if there is an actual product on
their website that you promise to buy if they accept Bitcoin payments.

Lets make this happen!
