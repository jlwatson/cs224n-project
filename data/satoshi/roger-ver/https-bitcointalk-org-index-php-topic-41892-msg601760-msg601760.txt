As great a conversation starter that the coins are, I suspect their biggest
short term benefit will be that people can now buy  
Bitcoins with a Credit card or Paypal.  
  
Now just about anyone has a convenient way to buy Bitcoins.  
The premium on the 25BTC coins is very reasonable, and will be even better on
the 100 BTC product that is coming soon.  
  
I'm suspecting that this may become a way to allow exchanges, or others, to
sell Bitcoins safely using Paypal and Credit cards.  
  
Any thoughts?
