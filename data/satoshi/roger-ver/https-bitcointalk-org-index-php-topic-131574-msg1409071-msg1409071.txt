i spammed the newbie section a little so i can post here. leave me some time
to make my post explaining PLEASE.  
My point of view has to be heard. I am totaly not a scammer.  
  
As i write it i kindly request all my info gets removed now. You decide later
if you have to post it or if its legal to do so.  

  
If you agree to refund my money if that is what the community thinks you
should do, I will gladly remove all your information now.  
  
I'm also happy to talk about it on the phone if you don't hang up on me again.
