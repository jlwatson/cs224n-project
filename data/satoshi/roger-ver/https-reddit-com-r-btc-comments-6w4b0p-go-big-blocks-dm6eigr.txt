I don't think I said I would never abandon segwit coins,  but I'm also adverse to putting all my eggs in one basket too.  For the moment Bitcoin.com is busy building new things based on BCH for Bitcoin.com, and we don't plan to work to add more than the minimum required to continue support for BTC per the NYA.  When business can choose between paying $100 per tx,  or $0.01 per tx,  it is clear which they will chose.
