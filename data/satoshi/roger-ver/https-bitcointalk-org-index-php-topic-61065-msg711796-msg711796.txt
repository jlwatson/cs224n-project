Between my normal work, and interesting Bitcoin side projects, I don't have
time to complete and run http://cc2bitcoin.com  
  
Just about all the work has been done for it to be up and running.  
I'm happy to give it to anyone who has the resources and willingness to run
it.  
Ideally it will be someone in Europe.  
The US doesn't have much need for this kind of service because anyone can buy
Bitcoins for cash using bitinstant.com  
  
All that is needed is:  
  
1\. A Paypal account  
2\. A CC merchant account.  
3\. Enough Bitcoins to buy and hold Casascius coins for inventory.  
4\. Time to process ship the orders.  
  
You will need to watch out for fraudulent orders, but I haven't had a single
one slip by yet.  
I'm happy to provide ongoing advice as well.  
With the premium people are willing to pay for the physical coins, there is
decent money to be made.
