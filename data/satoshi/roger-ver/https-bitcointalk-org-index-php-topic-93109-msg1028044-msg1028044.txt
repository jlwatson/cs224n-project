Lawyers are going to be very expensive and what if the "investors" don't have
any money to make you whole?  

  
Thats what I plan to find out, and to find who can be considered criminally
liable for the latest hack.  

  
The tragedy of this route is that on the one hand it's the only active route
that bitcoinica users can pursue at this point, but on the other hand I think
it reduces the odds of anyone getting anything back.  

  
its quite unfortunate and you're correct, but at this point I have absolutely
0 faith in the bitcoinica consultancy, I hate lawyers too but I at least
respect that they can sometimes get things done.  

Genjix stated multiple times, that Patrick and/or Donald where the one that
did constantly delay the payout. Maybe this process can now be faster, since
at least Patrick is gone. So hopefully genjix assumes that he is now
authorized to do the actual payouts and does it without further delay.  

  
Tihan and Zhou both specifically told Patrick and Donald to refund my 24,841
bitcoins, but Donald and Patrick both refused.  
One day after legal action was threatened, they announced this hack.  
Cause, or coincidence?
