Would you be willing to fly directly to him, get the password, drop the

avoid lawyers and that guy in NZ if we can. Is this reasonable?  

  
I'm willing to do this, but ultimately, I think someone who isn't a Bitcoinica
creditor should be the one to decide the distribution of the coins.  
  
Up until now, Patrick has refused to meet with me in person, but someone using
his return address has sent me strange / threatening letters in the mail:
