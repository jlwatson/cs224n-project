AFAIK you are the first large (~$10M revenu/year) computer hardware store to
accept Bitcoin. Very cool.  
  
I bought an HD 6990 for $720 today from Tigerdirect. I think you should match
their price. The MtGox avg was ~$5.60/BTC over the past 3 hours, so I will
consider buying one from you for **130 BTC** , including UPS ground shipping &
taxes. Ok?  

  
130 BTC is a deal if you are outside of California.  
  
I would much rather sell these for bitcoins than for USD!  
  
I'm doing my best to help bitcoins go main stream!
