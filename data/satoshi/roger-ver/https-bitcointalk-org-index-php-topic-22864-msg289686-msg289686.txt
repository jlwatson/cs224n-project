It's not me, but I am interested in doing a deal.  
We specialize in fiber optic transceivers for use in Cisco equipment, so I
don't think the market will be wide enough for that kind of thing. Do you guys
have any suggestions as to what popular product you would like me to do?  
I can do USB flash drives, but they wont be much/any cheaper than other online
sites.  
  
Any thoughts on what you would like to see?
