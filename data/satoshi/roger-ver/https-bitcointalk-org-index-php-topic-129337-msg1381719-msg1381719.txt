People need to remember that Amir is the one who stole the Bitcoinica source
code by "Open sourcing it"  
Before he did that, it was likely to be sold for enough money to pay back all
the people Bitcoinica owed money to.  
Instead Amir destroyed the one asset Bitcoinica still had that could be used
to solve the problem.  
  
A little bird told me that he may face some criminal problems for releasing
that code.  
I can't say that I will feel bad for him.
