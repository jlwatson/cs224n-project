Introducing the Bitcoin 100: A Kickstarter for Businesses  
  
In an attempt to get more businesses to accept Bitcoins directly as payments,  
lets compile a list of people who will promise to make an initial purchase
with Bitcoins.  
It will be a kind of Bitcoin cash mob.  
Once we have some decent numbers for a specific business, we will contact them
directly about accepting Bitcoins.  
  
Initial targets are:  
  
1\. BlueNile.com Prices start at just $25 !!!  
2\. Newegg.com  
3\. Memoryx.net  
4\. Your suggestion here  
  
Please post your name, and amount you pledge to buy and from which company
