You have no idea what you are talking about.  
  
  
1, If I knew MTGOX was going to go bankrupt, why would I offer to buy MTGOX
BTC? (Because I didn't know at that time)  
2, I haven't made a single bitcoin trade on any exchange since early January,
and luckily was too busy with my other stuff to buy even a single mtgox-BTC.  
  
You only know about 25% of what really went on.  
Go troll someone else.
