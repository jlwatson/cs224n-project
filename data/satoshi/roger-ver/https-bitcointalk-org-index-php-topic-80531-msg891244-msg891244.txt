Yesterday Yifu Guo (bitsyn.com) and I visited a company that produces Android
tablets.  
We went with the intention of buying tablets, but when they asked how we
wanted to use them, it all started.  
  
It became an intense meeting of nearly 5 hours.  
Nearly 75% of that time was spent discussing Bitcoins.  
The managing director and other members of the meeting were very enthusiastic
and seemed to get the big picture.  
At one point, he commented that "Bitcoin is a pandora's box."  
  
The company is very interested in preloading ALL OF THEIR TABLETS with Bitcoin
relay node software, AND a Bitcoin wallet software.  
They will then begin marketing their tablets as having this additional
"Bitcoin feature" that their competitors don't.  
They will market it along the lines that you can buy a tablet and become your
own bank, etc.  
  
This company ships about 150,000 Android devices per month.  
That is close to TWO MILLION tablets per year.  
  
I think this is another huge opportunity, and giant step forward for Bitcoin.  
I would suspect that with an extra 2M devices that have the Bitcoin relay node
software always running in the background,  
and that randomly connect to the internet from various IPs as their users use
them, the Bitcoin network would become impossible to block.  
  
Can someone with more technical knowledge chime in on the benefits of this
many extra nodes?  
  
In order for this to happen, the Bitcoin community will need to be ready to
help with the development of all the required software to do this.  
  
Items required from us:  
1) Super reliable Android Bitcion node relay software.  
2) Super reliable Android Chinese Bitcoin wallet software.
