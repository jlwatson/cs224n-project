The part that pushed my button so much was his comment that I accept bitcoins
because I am selling mining gear.  
The exact opposite is true. _I am selling mining gear **because** I accept
bitcoins._  
  
 ** _I accept bitcoins for deeply rooted philosophical reasons.  
_**  
  
I first read about the concept of online digital cash in the late 90's and was
enthralled by the idea.  
I had been waiting for the last decade for it to come along, and now that
bitcoins are here, I can hardly sleep.  
I spend just about every waking moment promoting them in every way I can.  
I'm positive bitcoins are going to change the world for the better, and I want
to be a part of that.  
I don't care at all about selling mining gear, and I can't think of something
more insulting to me than having my devotion to bitcoin being downplayed.  
  
Remember,  
I am the guy paying $1200 a month for the bitcoin bilboard:

$2500 a month for a national radio add on more than 105 stations across the
country:

I'm currently working on another project that I think will be the biggest news
yet for the bitcoin community.  
It's not for sure yet, but I hope to be able to make an announcement about it
at the end of this week. (Hopefully on Bruce's show)  
  
  
"Thank you" to all the forum members who helped make the above projects
possible.  
Keep your fingers crossed!
