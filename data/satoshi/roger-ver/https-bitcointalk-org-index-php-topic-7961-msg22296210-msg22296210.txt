*********************** Sept 2017 Update ***********************  
We are now offering a $1,000 bounty for the world's first Bitcoin Cash
Billboard.  
Details here: https://forum.bitcoin.com/topic149.html#p100058  
  
  
Well, the "Dollar is Exit Only" billboard has been online for the last 2 years
or so.  
It is starting to look a bit sun damaged and faded, so I think it is time for
the next one.  
  
  
  
  
  
Who has a good design idea?  
  
One idea that comes to my mind is:  
  
FREE CASH!  
(Bitcoin Cash)  
Bitcoin.com  
  
It also might be fun to point out that Bitcoin.org is rotten to the Core, and
engages in censorship in "support" of censorship free money. All in all, I
suppose we should just focus on how awesome Bitcoin Cash is.  
  
  
 **I'll pay $1,000 in Bitcoin Cash to whoever comes up with the design we
actually use.**
