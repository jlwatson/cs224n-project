I'm sad to report that Bitcoinstore.com has encountered our first scammer:

He ordered a video card earlier this week, but insisted that we declare it as
$0 dollars for customs.  
Legally we are not allowed to do this, so we offered to declare the full
amount, or refund his money.  
  
******* asked for a refund which was promptly sent.  
  
Unfortunately an extra 4.5119 was also sent to him that he is refusing to
return. (I understand that this is partially Bitcoinstore's fault)  
  
The Bitcoin address and payments in question are:

He has refused to refund the money when asked via email, and when I called on
the telephone, he hung up on me as soon as I told him my name.  
  
Other than the reputational enforcement from this posting, I don't know what
else can be done.  
  
Any ideas?  
  
 _BitcoinStore customer information is normally considered private, and will
only be divulged in cases of blatant attempted scamming._  
 _Because this order was placed with Bitcoin, we have no idea if the above is
his real name,  
but we can assume that the address is valid, and I know that the telephone
number is valid as well  
because when I called him, he knew exactly who I was, and why I was calling._
