The real question is why do you care what Roger Ver thinks? As far as I'm
concerned, his opinions are as valuable as those of any other random human on
this planet. He dislikes Core, he dislikes Segwit, and r/bitcoin and BTCT. Do
I need to say more?  

  
Way to put words in my mouth!  
  
For the record:  
I like Core, but they are misguided on the economics of this issue.  
I love Segwit, but it was supposed to be ready in April, and would only buy a
few months of extra time if 100% of the wallets implemented it instantly.  
I loved /r/Bitcoin and Bitcointalk, and was a daily user before all the
censorship by Theymos took over.  
Just look at /r/Bitcoin, people aren't even allowed to see the up-votes or
down-votes, let alone post an opinion that is in disagreement with Theymos.  
It makes me want to cry when I see how far things have strayed from the
principles that early bitcoin users claimed to support.
