  
Way to put words in my mouth!  
  
For the record:  
I like Core, but they are misguided on the economics of this issue.  
I love Segwit, but it was supposed to be ready in April, and would only buy a
few months of extra time if 100% of the wallets implemented it instantly.  
I loved /r/Bitcoin and Bitcointalk, and was a daily user before all the
censorship by Theymos took over.  
Just look at /r/Bitcoin, people aren't even allowed to see the up-votes or
down-votes, let alone post an opinion that is in disagreement with Theymos.  
It makes me want to cry when I see how far things have strayed from the
principles that early bitcoin users claimed to support.
