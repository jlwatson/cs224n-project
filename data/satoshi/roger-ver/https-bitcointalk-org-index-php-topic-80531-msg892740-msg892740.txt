are you going to run full bitcoin nodes on those tablets?  
are they for exportation or for the chinese domestic market?  
  

  
I will defer to people with more knowledge in regards to what kind of software
should be installed.  
  
The majority of their tablets are sold in the domestic Chinese market, but
they ship a substantial amount world wide.
