Here is an example of what I think is the most popular penny auction site
currently.  
  
http://www.beezid.com/  
  
It is a bit addicting to watch the live bidding on items that are about to
end.  
  
A site like this, that uses bitcoins, and allows anyone to post their product
for sale would be huge for Bitcoin.  
  
It would act as an auction site, online wallet, web of trust, and currency
exchange all at the same time, but in a format that many users are already
familiar with.  
  
It is a win - win - win - win for everyone involved.
