Maybe add Crucial to the list?  
  
I only say this because I was considering buying their solid state cache
product (http://www.techspot.com/review/515-crucial-adrenaline-ssd/) since I'm
too lazy to clone my drive to a full SSD.  
  
I'm on the fence for getting this but I'd grab it if it was available in
bitcoins, so ~$100.  
  
You can also put me down for around another $100 to anyone I can get 2x8GB
(DDR3-SDRAM PC3-10700 (667MHz) - [DDR3-1333] ) ram sticks from in the near
future.  

  
Everything you have asked for is available at www.newegg.com so I put you down
for $200 at Newegg.
