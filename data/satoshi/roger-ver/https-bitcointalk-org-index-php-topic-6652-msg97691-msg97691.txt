  
Why would anyone ever feel hatred towards governments?  
They only murdered (NOT including wars) more than 150 Million people in the
last century alone.  
  
Including:  
  
61,911,000 Murdered: The Soviet Gulag State  
35,236,000 Murdered: The Communist Chinese Ant Hill  
20,946,000 Murdered: The Nazi Genocide State  
10,214,000 Murdered: The Depraved Nationalist Regime  
  
I guess in your book, that is only a "slight injustice."  
  
I for one, want absolutely nothing to do with the CIA.  
I wish they would stay far far away.
