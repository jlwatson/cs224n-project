Why would we want additional people in the CIA to understand bitcoin?  

  
Finally someone who shares my view about this!  

  
Because we have nothing to hide?  
I sense much of the community members mentality have some irrational extremist
hate against the government. Any slight injustice is taken to the extreme and
paranoia rules their logic.  

  
Why would anyone ever feel hatred towards governments?  
They only murdered (NOT including wars) more than 150 Million people in the
last century alone.  
  
Including:  
  
61,911,000 Murdered: The Soviet Gulag State  
35,236,000 Murdered: The Communist Chinese Ant Hill  
20,946,000 Murdered: The Nazi Genocide State  
10,214,000 Murdered: The Depraved Nationalist Regime  
  
I guess in your book, that is only a "slight injustice."  
  
I for one, want absolutely nothing to do with the CIA.  
I wish they would stay far far away.
