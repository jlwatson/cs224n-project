I'm glad you guys like them.  
I've been paying for various Bitcoin billboards there since mid 2011.  
It's amazing how quickly the time has passed.  
  
P.S. If anyone has a picture of the previous Bitcoinstore.com billboard that
was there, please share it here.  
Unfortunately I don't have any pictures of that one, but I would like to.
