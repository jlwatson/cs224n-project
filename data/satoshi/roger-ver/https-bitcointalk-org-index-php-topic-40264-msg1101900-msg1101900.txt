Puik, I installed the IOS blockchaininfo wallet some time back before it was
pulled from the appstore. I now get the option to update it.  
If I update will it preserve my private keys and will it work as a full wasset
as before?  
I don't want to risk loosing the functionality my current version has.  
  

  
I updated mine, and everything worked even better.  
Some bugs were fixed, such as the last line in the address book being hard to
click.  
Thanks Puik!
