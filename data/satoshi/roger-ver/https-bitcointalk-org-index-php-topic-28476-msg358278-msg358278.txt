I was looking at this great little tool to convert BTC addresses into 2D
Barcodes:  
  
http://qr.ma.eatgold.com/  
  
It then occurred to me that this could be a great way to help new physical
businesses accept bitcoins.  
  
The idea is to make a website that lets a Bitcoin user to upload their:  
1\. Bitcoin address  
2\. optional company logo and text  
  
Then the website would output a page similar to the attached photo I made:  
  
  
  
The new Bitcoin merchant could then print out this page, and tape it next to
their cash register so any customer with a smartphone can use it to pay with
bitcoins.  
  
Making this webpage is beyond my skill set, but I am sure someone here can
make this easily.  
  
I know several businesses that would likely start using bitcoins right away if
they could do it this easily.  
  
Once this tool is created, we should also have a link to it from the "Retail
Business" section of
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_to_accept_Bitcoin,_for_small_businesses  
  
Any thoughts?

Now that a pretty decent tool is online at: http://ma.eatgold.com/accept/  
  
I posted a link to it from the Wiki here:

Where else can we post this tool that people who need it can easily find it?  
  
Please post it online, and then post the link back here for us all to see.
