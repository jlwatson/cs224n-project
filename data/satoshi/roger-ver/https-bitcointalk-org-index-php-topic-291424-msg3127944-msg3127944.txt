I actually blame this mostly on BitcoinStore.  

  
You not sending the payment in time is my fault?  
OK....

They could have registered me and my order before passing me to the BitPay
process.  

  
Actually we had it setup like this before and we had dozens of orders per day
entered into the system that people never paid for. It was a nightmare to deal
with. The current system is much better.

They could have given me a clear warning about having 15 minutes to get the
money to them.  
They say: "Do not use CoinBase if you wish to receive your order," which I now
realize is a cryptic reference to this exact situation.  
Instead, this could read: "Once the payment step begins you will have 15
minutes for your BTC transfer to be confirmed in the blockchain, otherwise
this order may be cancelled and your money returned."  

  
You are right, and this will be updated by tomorrow.

I am willing to share half the blame with BitPay. I should have expected a
bitcoin checkout to be more fussy than a Visa checkout. They should be as good
as Visa at tracking the money that people send them.

  
I don't see how you not sending the payment in time is Bitpay's fault,
although it is now their responsibility to track down your bitcoins.  
You have never had a traditional shopping cart checkout time out when you
didn't enter your CC information fast enough?  
This seems like an analogous situation to me.  
  
In the future, please don't use hosted wallets when you actually want the
payment to be sent at a specific time.
