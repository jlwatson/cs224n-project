  
You not sending the payment in time is my fault?  
OK....  
  
  
Actually we had it setup like this before and we had dozens of orders per day
entered into the system that people never paid for. It was a nightmare to deal
with. The current system is much better.  
  
  
You are right, and this will be updated by tomorrow.  
  
  
  
I don't see how you not sending the payment in time is Bitpay's fault,
although it is now their responsibility to track down your bitcoins.  
You have never had a traditional shopping cart checkout time out when you
didn't enter your CC information fast enough?  
This seems like an analogous situation to me.  
  
In the future, please don't use hosted wallets when you actually want the
payment to be sent at a specific time.
