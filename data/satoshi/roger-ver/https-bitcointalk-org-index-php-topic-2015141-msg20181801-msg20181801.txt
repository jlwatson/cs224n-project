Thanks for the civil reply! That is how adults should act on the internet. To
answer your questions, the number of Bitcoins I own is private, but the MTGOX
logs were leaked at some point and my entire transaction history with that
exchange leaked along with it. It showed that I only bought, never sold, and
that went on for years. My first wire to Mtgox was for $25K when they were
less than $1 each. Unfortunately Mtgox didn't credit my wire until they were
over $1 each. I suspect they actually front ran my order. Maybe someone else
can dig up the rest of those logs. I still own millions of dollars worth of
Bitcoin today. Far far more than all of my alt coin holdings combined. That
alone should be proof that I'm doing exactly what I think is best for the
future of Bitcoin. This is unlike most of the core and small block supporters
who came to bitcoin much later, and don't understand the characteristics that
made bitcoin come to be used as money.  
By their own admission, most of them hardly use Bitcoin at all.
