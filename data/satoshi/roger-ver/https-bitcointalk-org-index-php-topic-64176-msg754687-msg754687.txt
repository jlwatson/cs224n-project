Paraipan,  
  
The only time I have ever posted anything negative about someone on the forums
was in regards to Tom Williams.  
  
This will be the second time.  
  
People like you are exactly what is wrong with the world.  
Bitcoinica hasn't hurt anyone, so you should mind your own business.  
If you don't trust Bitcoinica, don't use them, but don't try to use men with
guns to block the rest of us from doing business with whoever we want.  
  
  
Please spend some time reading some books on economics, and morality.  
It will change your view of the world, and make you a better person.
