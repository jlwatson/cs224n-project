To be clear,  
  
I offered to give up %100 of what I was owed, along with 3 other creditors so
that everyone else would receive back %100 of their funds immediately.  
Instead, Amir posted the source code causing additional money to be stolen,
and no one has received any of their money back yet.  
  
Patrick (PhantomCircuit) has lied and stalled at every step of the way.  
He is directly responsable for the delays, if he would cooperate, everyone
would have already had the vast majority of their money back.  
  
He has also made personal threats against myself, and resorted to verbal
insults towards his other customers.  
  
Any legitimate businessman would not resort to such tactics.
