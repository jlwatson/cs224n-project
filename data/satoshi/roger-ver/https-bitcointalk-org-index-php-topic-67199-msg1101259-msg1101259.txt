In summary, the creditors have no logical reason to be angry with Amir, even
though they have plenty of emotional reasons.  

  
1\. Amir is directly responsible for allowing the theft of what is currently
worth more than $500,000 worth of customer funds.  
2\. Amir is directly responsible for the destruction of the only asset that
Bitcoinica had, that could have been sold to pay off the creditors. (The
proprietary Bitcoinica code)  
3\. Amir is directly responsible for delaying the return of funds to creditors
by refusing to relinquish his control of Bitcoinica.  
  
  
I think the creditors have plenty of rational reasons to be super angry with
Amir. (Genjix)
