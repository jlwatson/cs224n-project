I mean, their Great Firewall has successfully blocked Tor. Technically,
there's nothing stopping them from blocking the bitcoin network either.  

  
I'm using TOR just fine from inside China right now.  
It has no problem connecting at all.  
  
I also have some other BIG news that I will post tomorrow.  
If implemented, it will guarantee that the bitcoin network can not be blocked.
