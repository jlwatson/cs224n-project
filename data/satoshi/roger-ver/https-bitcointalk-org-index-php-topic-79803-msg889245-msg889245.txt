it's realy  
  
??  

  
It is really true that Bitinstant.com would like to allow everyone in China to
be able to buy Bitcoins, but we will need some help finding the right partner
company in China.  
  
It will need the following requirements:  
  
1) No Chargebacks  
2) Easily available across China.  
3) Allows for automatic communication with the Bitinstant system via API.  
  
  
Can anyone recommend a company like this in China?
