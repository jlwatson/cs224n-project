 **I don't think Matthew is sorry for anything other than losing the bet.**  
Below is a not so private skype conversation he initiated with me earlier
today.  
  
[9/10/12 3:47:49 PM] Matthew N. Wright: Just wanted to say that I'm sorry for
any negative backlash my prank might have caused. I had never intended to take
that bet seriously and was laughing for 3 weeks straight for which I honestly
thought would be an easy "fuck you", but it turned out I was shortsighted and
hurt a bunch of people. That really wasn't my intention and I feel awful. I
took the necessary steps for the businesses I'm involved in and have decided
to take a back seat to everything from now on.  
  
[9/10/12 3:48:51 PM] Roger Ver: I saw your posts and listed to you on DonkDown
Radio. I don't believe you.  
  
[9/10/12 3:51:15 PM] Matthew N. Wright: Don't believe the posts?  
[9/10/12 3:51:37 PM] Matthew N. Wright: Or don't believe that I'm sorry for
the backlash of this troll?  
  
[9/10/12 3:51:52 PM] Roger Ver: I don't believe that you intended for it to be
a prank from day one.  
[9/10/12 3:52:07 PM] Roger Ver: I'm sure you are sorry that you lost the bet.  
  
[9/10/12 3:53:31 PM] Matthew N. Wright: I had discussed the prank with
johnthedong, Vicente, and several others beforehand. It was all a show. I
heard the arguments as to why it "must have been a scam", but regardless of
how it looks, I was caught up in the entertainment.  
[9/10/12 3:54:09 PM] Matthew N. Wright: I'm not sorry for trolling the
community (it really needed it and I believe I have helped push through some
new changes), I'm just sorry so many people who I thought would laugh at it
ended up just getting hurt by it. That wasn't intentional.  
  
[9/10/12 3:56:20 PM] Roger Ver: I think your best course of action at this
time would be to stop lying about it being a joke from day one. Then post an
apology on the forum telling everyone that you thought you were going to win
the bet, and that you are sorry that you never had the money to make good on
your half of the bargain.  
  
[9/10/12 3:59:16 PM] Matthew N. Wright: cbeast has suggested the same thing
but I am not sure what an apology would do. Although I know I stepped over a
line of sorts, there are people trying to use what I say against me legally at
this moment (including Vladimir) and I am not sure what an apology to the
community would result in
