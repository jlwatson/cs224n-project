I just spent my evening presenting Bitcoin to about 50 more Japanese business
people in Sapporo. (A city in the northern most island)  
I also installed the Blockchain and Bitcoinspinner apps on all their smart
phones and gave each of them their first 0.05 bitcoin.  
I'm sure the majority of them will be buying their own bitcoin soon.  
I am also sure that because of the efforts I am involved with in Japan, the
Japanese have bought more than 25,000,000 JPY (~$317,000 USD) worth of
bitcoins in the last few weeks and that it is just the beginning.  
Unfortunately I currently can't provide the exact details as to how I know the
exact amount, but I am sure this is just a small fraction of what is to come.
