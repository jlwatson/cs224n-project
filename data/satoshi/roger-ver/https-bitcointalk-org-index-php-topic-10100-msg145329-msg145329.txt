I heard about it on Free Talk Live around Dec of 2010. (www.freetalklive.com)  
I thought it was a great idea when I heard about it, but was disappointed when
it looked like almost no one was using them.  
Then when I heard about the federal poker ban, I knew that bitcoins had found
their calling.  
(Actually one of their many callings)  
  
I've hardly been able to sleep since!
