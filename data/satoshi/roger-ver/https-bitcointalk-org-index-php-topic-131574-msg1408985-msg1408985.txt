Some kind of blockchain recording everyone's trustworthyness would be an
interesting tool to try to develop.  
Everyone would have a copy, so they could instantly check to see if someone
they want to do business with is trustworthy or not.  
  
For now, I just want the world to know what a jerk and scammer this guy is.
