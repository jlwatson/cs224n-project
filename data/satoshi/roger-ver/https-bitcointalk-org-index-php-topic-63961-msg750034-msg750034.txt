Any of you dialed-in folks know how antagonistic the Japanese govt is towards
BTC?  

  
I don't think there will be any trouble from the Japanese govt.  
They are much calmer than their US counterparts.  
  
For the most part, no one has even heard of Bitcoins in Japan, but through
some good luck and social networking, the Japanese porn industry is now very
interested in Bitcoins.
