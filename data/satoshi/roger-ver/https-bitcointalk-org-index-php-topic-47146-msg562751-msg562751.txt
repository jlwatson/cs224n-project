Unlocked iPhone4s phones are hard to find right now.. most of the people
selling them on eBay are mistakenly selling carrier-locked phones, and the
ones genuinely selling the factory unlocked version (which shouldn't be
available until November, officially) must know someone on the inside. Good
luck finding someone like that who trolls the bitcointalk forums.  
  
Having said that, if you _do_ find someone, please kindly direct them to me.  

  
The unlocked ones are already on pre-order in Canada and some other countries.  
The USA is getting screwed with carier locked versions.  
  
I found someone who I think is legit to help me already.
