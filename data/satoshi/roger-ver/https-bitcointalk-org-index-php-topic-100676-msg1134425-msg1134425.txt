For a limited amount of time and businesspeople, 300,000 USD is a sizable
amount to invest. Might speculation be one of their interests?  

  
Their interest is three fold.  
1\. Speculation  
2\. The ease of sending value anywhere in the world instantly with no counter
party risk is apparent to them.  
3\. They all seem to think that the Bitinstant Bitcoin Mastercard is the
coolest thing in the universe and all want it ASAP.  
  
At the meeting tonight, there were typical Bitcoin techie types in their 20's,
lots of middle aged business people, and even one woman who was at least in
her 60s and possibly in her 70s.  
It was amazing to see such a wide variety of people interested in Bitcoin.  
  
Unfortunately one young mother in attendance managed to lose her first 0.01BTC
forever.  
I had everyone, including her, install the Blockchain iphone app.  
She never registered her email address (I didn't have time to walk her through
it) and after receiving her 0.01 BTC she logged out, without ever having saved
her wallet identifier in any way.
