I recently changed the password to my wallet.  
Now when trying to pair my iphone with my existing wallet by scanning the QR
code, I receive the following error:  
  
  
  
When I enter the password that I am %100 sure is the correct password (I can
login to the wallet in Safari using this password.) I still receive the same
error.  
I have already run the "integrity check" on the wallet as well.
