Julz,  
  
Thank you for your concern. I share some of them myself.  
  
I actually expected it to get more press attention than it did so far.  
  
I also posted a link in the video description to an encrypted file that
contains my thoughts on why I offered this bet.

It may make for some interesting reading in the future, if/when I make it
public.
