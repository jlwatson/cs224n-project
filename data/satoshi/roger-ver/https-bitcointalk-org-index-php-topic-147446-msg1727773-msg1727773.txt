how many days does it take to get a order process n shipped, and whats the
refund policy on items not processed for shipping yet, im gonna get my coins
back if it doesnt ship by friday.  

Domestic orders usually ship the same day depending on what time the order was
placed.  
International orders first ship to the MemoryDealers office in California, and
then are reshipped to the final international destination.  
  
All orders that are delayed because of any issue on BitcoinStore.com's side
are eligible for a full refund any time BEFORE the order has actually shipped
from the distributor.  
  
The real time inventory feed isn't yet "real time" so occasionally customers
are able to order items that are back ordered.  
Fixing this issue is one of our top priorities.
