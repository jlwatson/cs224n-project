I'm sorry I led people to trust Mtgox.
I'm sorry I allowed Mtgox to use me in this way.
I'm sorry I ever made that video to help Mtgox.
It seemed like the right thing at the time.

But I'm sick of people claiming I said Mtgox was was solvent!
I NEVER SAID THAT, EVER!
 **Liquidity != Solvency**

I chose my words very carefully.
That is why I read them from my own script.
I said Mtgox had lots of **LIQUIDITY** 7 months ago when I made that video.
That was certainly true, but is completely different from saying that they
were **solvent**.

Today I'm at the Mtgox world headquarters in Tokyo Japan.  
I had a nice chat with MTGOX CEO, Mark Karpeles, about their current
situation.
He showed me multiple bank statements, as well as letters from banks and
lawyers.
I'm sure that all the current withdrawal problems at MTGOX are being caused by
the traditional banking system, not because of a lack of liquidity at MTGOX.
The traditional banking partners that MTGOX needs to work with are not able to
keep up with the demands of the growing Bitcoin economy.
The dozens of people that make up the MTGOX team are hard at work establishing
additional banking partners, that eventually will make dealing with MTGOX
easier for all their customers around the world. For now, I hope that everyone
will continue working on Bitcoin projects that will help make the world a
better place._
