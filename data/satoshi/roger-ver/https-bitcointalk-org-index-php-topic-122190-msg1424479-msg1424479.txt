I will look into what is causing them not to show up, and should have the
problem fixed soon.  
  
2\. Unfortunately Jlabs is not one of the brands carried by our current
distributor, and they also don't have cases for the Sansa Fuze.  
In the future we will add additional distributors but this is still at least a
month or two out, and adds a significant amount of complexity to the import
system.  
  
The good news is that if you are in the market for the Sansa Fuze itself we
are MUCH cheaper than Amazon!
