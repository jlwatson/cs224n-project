I thank everyone for their kind words, and good sense of humor, but the
important issue is actually getting a large company like this to accept
Bitcoins.  
  
I would guess there are two main road blocks from their point of view.  
  
1\. Will they even get any orders from people with Bitcoins?  
2\. How can they automate the Bitcoin checkout?  
  
  
To solve #1, lets make a list of people who will promise to make a purchase
from Blue Nile with Bitcoins should they publicly accept them.  
It can work similarly to the Bitcoin 100 for charities, but this time, it will
be for large corporations.  
  
They have items starting from just $25, so nearly everyone can afford to help
out.  
  
Let's call this project "the Bitcoin 100: A Kickstarter for big businesses"  
  
Some initial target companies that come to mind are:  
1\. Bluenile.com  
2\. newegg.com  
3\. memoryx.net (I know the owner, and he seems likely to be converted.)  
  
I've started the official thread here:
