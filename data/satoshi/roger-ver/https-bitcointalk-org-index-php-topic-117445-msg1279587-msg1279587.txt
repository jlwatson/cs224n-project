Hey dumbass everybody is getting their money back.  

  
For those who don't know, phantomcircuit is one of the Intersango and
Bitcoinica owners.  
Please note how he addresses his customers in the quote above.  
  
  
phantomcircuit / Patrick Strateman, when am I getting my money back?  
  
 **You still owe me 23,290.6791 Bitcoins!**  
I've been waiting for months now, and all I have received from you are:  
  
1\. Thinly veiled threats against my personal safety.  
2\. Personal Insults  
3\. Lies about myself and other respectable people in the Bitcoin community.  
4\. Your effort at every step, to block a easy solution for all of
Bitcoinica's customers.  
  
Before calling others a "Dumbass" please do some inner reflection.
