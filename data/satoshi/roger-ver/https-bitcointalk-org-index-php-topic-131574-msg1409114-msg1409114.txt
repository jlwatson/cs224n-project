  
Nikoloas,  
  
As part owner, I have admin access to Blockchain.info, so depending on the
notification settings you have for your wallet there, I can look up accounts
based on a Bitcoin address. %100 for sure that bitcoin address is owned and
controlled by you, and you received the funds from me.  
  
Now do the right thing and send them back:  
  
4.5119 BTC to 18yDbzddGVEr1Vyp4NXrP6mqAmUTesAg9a  
  
Once you do that, I will delete the rest of your information from this public
thread and we can both put this behind us.  
  
 **I caught you %100 red handed lying about this.**  
  
For those who are interested, here is the full support ticket history. Read it
from the bottom to top:

Should I consider this a threat that should be turned over to the authorities?

I'm still waiting for your lawyer's contact information.

Roger TODAY 07:37 PM

You are on block list, you will only speak with my lawyer for what you have
done so far. Everything is logged. Subject closed  
  
  
Nethead TODAY 06:26 PM  
Your mail does not prove anything, anyone can mail to anyone from any domain
you want. Expose me? Do it.  
You have failed my friend because you shouldnt touch that information,
BlockChain TOS does not say so as of today. I know i didnt touch your
bitcoins. ITS your fault that you added the address i gave you on the payment
system, not mine. So if you say that you are a co-owner and you still say its
a permanent address then i do not have anything else to say. Do whatever you
want, but be careful where you put my information, thats a little hint.  
  
Have a nice day man i hope you get your bitcoins.  
As of now im out of this game  
  
  
Roger TODAY 06:16 PM  
To prove to you my ownership stake in blockchain.info, I just sent you an
email from my roger@blockchain.info email address.  
  
Do the right thing and send me back my money.  
  
Roger  
  
  
Nethead TODAY 06:02 PM  
I know the name "Roger", but EVEN if you OWN (which you do not) you SHOULDNT
toutch ANY personal info. Both bitcoinstore AND blockchain (which YOU
involved) are in trouble. I dont get it "my last chance"? "to make my life
easier"? Explain  
  
As i said i do not have OR had any of your money. I really hope i didnt ever
came to your failstore.  
  
  
Roger TODAY 05:56 PM  
Nethead, I own 25% of blockchain.info  
I also own 15% of Bitinstant.com  
%100 of Bitcoinstore.com  
%100 or Memorydealers.com  
I also own a % of coinlab.com, ripple.com ogrr.com and I am the largest single
donor to bitcoinfoundation.org  
  
I'm Roger Ver, the post prolific Bitcoin investor the world has ever seen:

Stop trying to steal from me, I caught you %100.  
  
This is your final chance to do the right thing and send my money back.

Do it now, and both our lives will be easier, and you will be a better person
for it.

Nethead TODAY 05:44 PM  
I said what is true, you are not part-owner on blockchain, i do not have or
ever had your money, annddd i said what is going to happen  
  
Have a nice day sir, except if you have anything else to add  
  
  
Roger TODAY 05:42 PM  
Nikolaos,  
  
I didn't get into any of your mail logs or your server.  
I'm part owner of Blockchain.info so I can see all the addresses in your
wallet, and I caught you red handed in your lie.  
  
You have my money, and you need to send it right now to
18yDbzddGVEr1Vyp4NXrP6mqAmUTesAg9a (4.5119 BTC)  
  
Stop lying, stop wasting both of our time, and send me back my money.  
  
Thank you,  
  
Roger Ver  
  
  
Nethead TODAY 05:38 PM  
You are going to get fined, blockchain will be involved in this. What you sent
IS personal information, does not prove anything else than you are trying to
threaten me, you shouldnt have that, and everything is against you.  
  
Once again, i do not have your money, but you definitely deserved that, if i
had them i would return them, i would return your fault back.  
  
Your fine WILL exceed 10000 BTC if you want to talk in bitcoins.  
  
Now do you have anything else to add?  
  
  
Nethead TODAY 04:49 PM  
Dude now you are in terrible trouble for getting to my mail (logs on MY
server) AND stealling my wallet (also logged), before i sent this i have
spoken to my lawyer and got all your information from your website. Also
printscreened YOU sending MY information. This was not a permanent address, so
you know you are in trouble.  
  
Wait call from my lawyer  
  
All that info is logged  
  
  
Roger TODAY 04:36 PM  
Nikolaos,  
  
I looked up your address with Blockchain, and %100 for sure the funds were
sent to a Bitcoin address that you control.  
  
Here is the proof of the link to your account corresponding with Bitcoin

I'm sorry Zlatko made the mistake in refunding you too much money to begin
with.  
Thank you for doing the right thing and returning the money,

WOW thats kinda sad, for both of us because it was an anonymous receiving
address from my online wallet. Should I give my permanent address to forward
payments to??? It would be great!!  
  
I didnt receive anything, someone else got lucky today, but let me remind you
thats its your fault in the first place that you didnt want to sent me what i
bought. Im not lying here, that is my real name here and im from my real ip
address.  
  
  
Zlatko Bijelic TODAY 11:46 AM  
Nikolaos,  
  
I hope that you are doing well.  
  
You may have noticed that you received about 4.50932664 BTC coins today
(2012-12-19 01:35:38) - this was due to a mistake on our end by giving the
customer an incorrect Bitcoin Address for payment. I would like to ask if you
can send us those Bitcoins?  
  
Thank you in advance, I hope that you have a great day!
