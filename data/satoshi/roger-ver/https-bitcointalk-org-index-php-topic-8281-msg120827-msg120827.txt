  
I think you are right about this being my weakest link.  
  
The deepbit screen hides the actual login password, but displays all the
passwords for each worker in the client.  
Until today, we used the same password for both.  
Multiple people (about ten) in the warehouse could of looked at the screen and
noticed the username and password.  
I think my only chance is by finding the IP address of the person who logged
into my deepbit account.
