A question: Did you use the same password for deepbit login as for submitting
the shares from mining client?  
  
Because if did, then anyone who can spy on your HTTP headers (local network
users) then can see your password, too.  
  
On deepbit, you can set another password for worker (even the first), but by
default, the passwords are the same. Not safe IMHO.  
  

  
I think you are right about this being my weakest link.  
  
The deepbit screen hides the actual login password, but displays all the
passwords for each worker in the client.  
Until today, we used the same password for both.  
Multiple people (about ten) in the warehouse could of looked at the screen and
noticed the username and password.  
I think my only chance is by finding the IP address of the person who logged
into my deepbit account.
