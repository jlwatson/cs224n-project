I ordered a netbook 6 days ago and haven't received anything yet... is this
normal?  

  
Email your order number to roger at bitcoinstore.com and I will take care of
it for you.  
  
Lots of people are sending the payment, but then not clicking the button to
actually submit their order to the site.  
If you haven't gotten a confirmation email, that is likely the case with your
order.  
  
Either way, I can get it taken care of for you.
