Everyone,  
  
Thank you for your input.  
  
For those concerned about the illegal aspects of Bitcoin, I they will surely
come up durring the interview.  
The main host openly admits that he refuses to pay federal income taxes
because he doesn't support the things the federal government does.  
He spoke of the silk road way back in 2010 as the potential "killer app" for
bitcoins.  
  
I understand that many people have very different political views, but please
keep in mind that the majority of the listeners to this radio show  
think:  
  
1.Taxation is the moral equivalent of theft.  
2\. The draft is the moral equivalent of kidnapping and slavery.  
3\. The government is the most successful organized criminal gang in a
particular area.  
4\. Because of the first three items, they want nothing to do with the state.  
  
I understand that most people do not agree with the above, but because most
listeners of this show do, I think they will be interested in my original
points.  
If I was going on the Oprah Winfrey show, I should certainly use a different
list of talking points.  
  
I will continue to monitor this thread for about the next 10 hours.  
I will post the interview on youtube as soon as it is available.  
  
Thank you all for your advice.  
I am taking all of it into consideration.
