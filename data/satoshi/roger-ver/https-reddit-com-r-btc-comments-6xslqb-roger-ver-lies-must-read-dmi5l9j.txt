A better title would be "This article is propaganda".
I have no reason to lie about how much I pay in fees.  All of the Bitcoin.com team members are paid from a multisig wallet so the fees are higher than the basic transactions the author theorized that we were using.  The reality is that on most days I do at least one transaction where the fee is over $100 too.  This is common for any business trying to use Bitcoin and is why many of them are adopting alts.
