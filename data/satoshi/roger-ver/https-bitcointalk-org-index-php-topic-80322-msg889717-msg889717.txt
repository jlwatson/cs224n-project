I think it's a good idea,  
Bitcoinica once add AliPay as funding methods,  
but it disappeared later. Wonder why?  
  
  

  
Alipay does not allow payments to be used for Currency exchange.  
If you contact someone privately, they will likely sell you Bitcoinica credit
for Alipay.  
  
Is there a Chinese language bitcoin wallet you can recommend?  
My vendor is ready for me to pay him with Bitcoins!
