This problem may have to do with the wallet password length.  
I created a brand new wallet with a 102 Character password.  
When I tried to pair my phone with the brand new wallet, I received the same
error.  
I then shortened the password to 30 characters and the phone was successfully
able to pair with the wallet.  
  
I then shortened the password for my original blockchain wallet to 30
characters, but the phone will still not sync.  
  
(My passwords contain upper and lower case letters, numbers, special
characters and white spaces)  
  
I would prefer not to need to start a new wallet so I can keep my address book
and account history.  
  
  
\--------------------------------------------------------  
I've discovered another bug.  
When updating the main wallet password in google chrome, it says that the
password change succeeded and logs me out of the wallet.  
When I try to login with the new password, it fails.  
I can still login with the original password one time.  
If I log out, and try to login with the original password again, it fails, but
I can now login with the new password.  
  
  
\-------------------------UPDATE----------------------------  
  
I updated my password to a shorter one with upper and lower case letters and
numbers, now the iphone wallet successfully pairs with the wallet, so the
issue seems to clearly be related to the wallet password.
