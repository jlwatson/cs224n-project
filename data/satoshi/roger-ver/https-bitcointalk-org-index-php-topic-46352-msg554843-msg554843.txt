I do apologize if my post was not to your standards.  
  
Perhaps we have different definitions of "success." If I steal a million
dollars from society and build a beautiful park, is that a "successful
implementation" of a park? Does the fact that the beautiful park is desirable
give me the moral right to coercively obtain the resources with which to
create it?  

Taxes aren't theft and not having large amounts of the population die from
easily treatable medical conditions for a few percentage points of profit is
definitely a 'success'.  

  
FAtlas,  
  
I'm curious.  
Every time I see a post of yours on the forum, you are very anti-Bitcoin, and
very pro-government involvement in every post.  
You seem to spend lots of time on this forum where most members have a very
different viewpoint than yourself.  
  
I would like to know if you are being paid by an organization to spread your
anti-Bitcoin, anti-freedom message on this forum, or if you just spend this
much time because it is entertaining for you on a personal level.  
  
I don't mean this as a personal attack in any way, I am just curious if
spreading Bitcoin negativity is your job.
