  
FAtlas,  
  
I'm curious.  
Every time I see a post of yours on the forum, you are very anti-Bitcoin, and
very pro-government involvement in every post.  
You seem to spend lots of time on this forum where most members have a very
different viewpoint than yourself.  
  
I would like to know if you are being paid by an organization to spread your
anti-Bitcoin, anti-freedom message on this forum, or if you just spend this
much time because it is entertaining for you on a personal level.  
  
I don't mean this as a personal attack in any way, I am just curious if
spreading Bitcoin negativity is your job.
