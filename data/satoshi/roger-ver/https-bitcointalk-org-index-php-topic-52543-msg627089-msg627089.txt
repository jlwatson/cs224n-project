I will contribute 10 BTC to each organization as long as Bitcoins are under
$10 each.  
  
GREAT IDEA!  

  
I just reread your post, MD. Do I read it right? 10 BTC per organization
_(with the caveat)_? If so, I will adjust the pledge amount after your name on
the list.  
  

  
10 BTC from me per organization is fine.  
(potentially 1,000 BTC total if we get 100 organizations)  
  
As long as they are real organizations that have been around for a while, I am
happy to help.
