They're not new. They've been on the Bitcom.org wiki page for some time.  
  
They accept Bitcoins because they're selling gear for Bitcoin miners. And
their shopping cart system (which is Yahoo Store) doesn't accept Bitcoins.  
  
Now if Yahoo Store accepted Bitcoins and converted them for the merchant, that
would be big news. But no.  

  
Nagle,  
  
You have no idea why I accept bitcoins, and I can assure you that it has
nothing to do with the fact that I sell some bitcoin mining gear. I added that
gear several weeks AFTER I began accepting bitcoins.  
My current yahoo shopping cart system DOES accept bitcoin orders, and I have
already contacted Yahoo Store directly, asking them to allow all their users
to easily accept bitcoins. I would appreciate it if you would **check your
facts** and not jump to conclusions about myself and my company in the future.
