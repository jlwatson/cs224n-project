  
Nagle,  
  
You have no idea why I accept bitcoins, and I can assure you that it has
nothing to do with the fact that I sell some bitcoin mining gear. I added that
gear several weeks AFTER I began accepting bitcoins.  
My current yahoo shopping cart system DOES accept bitcoin orders, and I have
already contacted Yahoo Store directly, asking them to allow all their users
to easily accept bitcoins. I would appreciate it if you would **check your
facts** and not jump to conclusions about myself and my company in the future.
