To Clarifiy,  
  
I have 3 BRAND NEW HD6990 video cards for sale.  
New means that the box has never been opened, and they have never been
inserted into a mother board.  
  
I ALSO have about 5 used HD6990 cards.  
They have been in use mining for about 2 months now.  
They are in fine condition without any problems, and we still have just about
all the original boxes/manuals accessories etc.  
  
To clarify, I want to be paid in Bitcoins.  
I am NOT interested in cash, credit cards or bank wire transfers.  
  
Please contact me at roge@memorydealers.com if you are interested.
