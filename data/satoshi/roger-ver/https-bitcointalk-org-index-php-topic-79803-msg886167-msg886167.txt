I have rented a large room at a restaurant for Tuesday May 8th at 7PM for all
of us to meet and discuss how to use Bitcoins to make more money in our
businesses.  
Most of the people I am inviting are vendors or customers of
MemoryDealers.com, but anyone who is interested is welcome to come.  
Please invite any other business person who is interested in Bitcoins!  
The more people who come, the better!  
My Chinese Bitcoin friend who lives in New York is also with me, and will
explain Bitcoins to everyone in Chinese.
