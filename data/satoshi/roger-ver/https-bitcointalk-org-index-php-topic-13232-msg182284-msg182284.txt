...compared to say u.s. dollar bills which you can hold in your hand or stuff
in your mattress.  
  
this is why bitcoins will not go mainstream because majority of human beings
on this planet do not have access to a computer.  
  
successful gold standards are things like toyota trucks, ak-47's, u.s. c-notes
which thrive in places like afghanistan and africa.  

  
Damn it!  
This must be the same reason why the internet has failed!
