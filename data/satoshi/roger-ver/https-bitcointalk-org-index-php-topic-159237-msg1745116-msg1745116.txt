I don't know TorBroker or any of the people behind it, but about a month and a
half  
ago they contacted me, and at least one other well known member of the  
Bitcoin community and asked us to publicly hold 1,000 BTC as a security  
bond that would be used to refund customers if TorBroker ever disappeared  
with their customers money.  
  
While I fully support TorBroker's efforts to bring additional economic  
freedom to traditional financial markets, legally it didn't seem safe  
for me to be the front man for this.  
  
The fact that they were looking for someone to hold this bond seems to  
be a strong indication that they are in this for the long term, and do not  
intend to disappear with everyone's money.  
If the regulators are able to uncover the true identities of the  
TorBroker accounts, I am sure that they (the regulators) will steal everyone's
money though.  
  
I wish TorBroker the best of luck, and financial tyrants the worst.
