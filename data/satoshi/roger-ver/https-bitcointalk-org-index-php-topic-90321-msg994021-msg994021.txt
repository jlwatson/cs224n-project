I will pay $20 worth of Bitcoins to the first person to cut the Audio from my
(Roger Ver) interview and Eric Voorhees' interview from Freetalklive.com  
The Audio files are here:  
  
http://www.freetalklive.com/content/podcast_2012_06_22 My interview starts
about 20 minutes in.  
http://www.freetalklive.com/content/podcast_2012_06_23 Erik's interview starts
just a few minutes in.  
  
Please cut them into two video files in a style similar to this:

Feel free to use just a couple different photos that you think are
appropriate.  
Some of these photos may be useful:

Once they are ready, email me the download link and the Bitcoin payment
address.  
  
Thanks!
