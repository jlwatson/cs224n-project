is it still possible to use the blockchain app from korean appstore?  
  
we managed to install it on a phone and upon startup we even see the full
features at the bottom for half a second.  
  
However these icons disappear and only one icon is left. The app keeps beeping
and shows public transactions.  
  
Any way to couple this to a wallet and use it as a wallet?  
  

You can install it from any app store. (Not only Korean)  
If you install it from an IP address that already has accessed a
Blockchain.info wallet that is more than two weeks old, the iphone app will
have the full wallet functionality enabled.
