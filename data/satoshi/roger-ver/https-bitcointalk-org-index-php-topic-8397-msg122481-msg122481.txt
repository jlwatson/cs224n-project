I specialize in optical transceivers used in Cisco equipment, so pricing on my
current website for items other than those are not up to date.  
However, I have access to just about any kind of computer parts you guys need
at prices that are just about the same as www.newegg.com  
I'm working on having an automated shopping cart that supports Bitcoin
payments soon, but we are still a few weeks away for that.  
  
For now, I'm willing to accept payment in bitcoins at whatever the current
mtgox exchange is at the time of sale.  
What kinds of products would you be most interested in?  
  
Here are a few examples that I think people may be interested in:  
  
Hitachi 1TB HDS721010CLA332 SATA2 U300 7200rpm 32MB Hard Drive $59  
Hitachi 2TB HDS723020BLA642 SATA3 U300 7200rpm 64MB Hard Drive $125

In most cases I will be able to match or be within a few % of Newegg's price.  
Just about everything can ship the same day you order.
