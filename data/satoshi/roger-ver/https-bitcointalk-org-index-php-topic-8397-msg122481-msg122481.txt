I specialize in optical transceivers used in Cisco equipment, so pricing on my
current website for items other than those are not up to date.
However, I have access to just about any kind of computer parts you guys need
at prices that are just about the same as www.newegg.com
I'm working on having an automated shopping cart that supports Bitcoin
payments soon, but we are still a few weeks away for that.

For now, I'm willing to accept payment in bitcoins at whatever the current
mtgox exchange is at the time of sale.
What kinds of products would you be most interested in?

Here are a few examples that I think people may be interested in:

In most cases I will be able to match or be within a few % of Newegg's price.
Just about everything can ship the same day you order.
If there is anything specific you would like, email me directly
or post the part number below and I will add the price to the list above.
Sending a private message through the forum will give the slowest reply.

Lets get the real BTC economy going!
