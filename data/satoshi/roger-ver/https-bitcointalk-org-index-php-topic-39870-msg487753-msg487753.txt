Any such effort should be well coordinated and some things should be clarified
beforehand:  

  * what happens if the organization does not accept the donation for whatever reason?

I'm sure we will be able to find someone willing to take free money.  

Quote

  * what happens if the targeted amount is not achieved?

I think charities may be tempted to accept a smaller amount, or I may be
tempted to put up additional money.  

Quote

  * how long should we wait to decide these two cases?

I think everything should be able to be settled by the end of Sept 2011, but
there is no reason to set the time limit in stone.  

Quote

  * is the donation paid even if the organization makes some kind of a one-time exception to accept Bitcoin?

It is our money, so we can decide what we want to do with it.  

Quote

  * what happens if the donated fund is suddenly worth much more than the targeted amount?

I will find another good bitcoin promoting project to spend the money on. I
think I have a good track record:

If everyone who has viewed this topic had donated just one bitcoin, we would
already have more than enough money to make this happen.  
  
The funds are very secure stored with www.mtgox.com  
  
Please send your donation now!

In addition to Bitcoins, I need everyones help to make this happen.  
Lets start contacting charities today, asking if they can accept bitcoin
donations.  
Maybe we can get more on board just by asking.  
Can someone post a list of charities to contact?  
  
  
Lets make this happen!
