50k for a wedding ring!!! Baller! Congrats Roger! I am happy for you!  

  
Actually, if I can't get a major merchant on board with this purchase, I will
buy a MUCH MUCH cheaper ring.  
  
I'm lucky that my fiance doesn't care much about Diamonds or Bitcoins, or
money in general.  
She just wants a happy family.
