I think your time would be better spent on agorist projects. The great thing
about bitcoins is that they don't need the state's permission for just about
anything.  
  
"Asking" politicians for permission is how we got to where we are now.  
  
Maybe you can set up a gambling site where people can place bets on what will
happen to the first politician who bans bitcoins. I suspect that would be much
more effective than any lobbying group.
