We need to find more ways to encourage people to use bitcoins as money that
they trade for goods and services.  
If everyone just tries to trade their BTC for USD right away, the price will
go down.  
  
Go use your bitcoins to buy something other than USD!  
  
I will gladly accept bitcoins for everything in my online store.
