Will you stock laptops with Haswell CPU's when they are released in June? I am
in the market for a new PC but I want to wait for Haswell.  

  
Yes, these will be carried as soon as they are released.

I went in search of SSDs on bitcoinstore.com, and they're almost all out of
stock. Why?  

Most of them are actually in stock, but we are still working on improving the
import script.  
Feel free to contact us if there is a specific model that you need.

They dont know how to filter results on this site? Bitpay is never working on
checkout (even now I just checked), so you cant even pay if you wanted to
either. I received an email saying oh hey remember that free shipping it
listed on that item and on checkout and on the site everywhere? Yeah no, you
need to pay another 100$ or cancel the order.  

  
We are working on better filtering.  
Bitpay seems to be working fine and we get dozens of orders per day with it.  
If you are having a problem, please let us know the exact details so we can
fix it.  
There is free shipping on everything except extra large or heavy items that
can't be shipped via normal carriers. (Like 50+ inch TVs)
