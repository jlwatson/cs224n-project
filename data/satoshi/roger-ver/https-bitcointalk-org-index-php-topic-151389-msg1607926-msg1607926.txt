I would like to make a few clarifications in regards to Bitcoin store.  
  
1\. $850K is the Quarterly target in order to stay in the best pricing tier.  
  
2\. If Bitcoinstore.com doesn't reach this goal, it will continue in
businesses, but with slightly higher prices.  
  
3\. I'm aware that the site still needs a lot of polishing, specifically
regarding the searching and filtering options.  
  
4\. The goal widget on the fron't page doesn't currently update automatically,
but you can monitor our progress at

5\. I previously negotiated with the distributor to let us start off with the
best price tier for Q1 2013.  
Everything with the Developers has taken MUCH longer than planed. Time was
running out, so I had to launch the site before it was truly ready in order to
have any chance of meeting the sales target for this quarter.  
  
6\. I think if we can hit close to $300K, I will have a good chance of getting
the distributor to allow us to continue in the best price tier since 98% of
the sales will have been from March.  
  
7\. If you are a professional Magento developer and would like to help with
Bitcoinstore.com (Search, Filters, data import, etc) Please contact me.  
(You will be paid in BTC)  
  
With everyone's help, Bitcoin is well on it's way to changing the world for
the better!
