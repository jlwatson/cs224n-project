  
Here is %100 proof of how I know what the seminars are responsible for:  
  
  
  
The above image shows deposit records from people who heard about Bitcoin
through the seminars.  
Each user must deposit a minimum of 100000 yen. (They often deposit more than
that)  
So far there have been 237 deposits through the seminars starting August 9th,  
The absolute minimum amount this could be is 23,700,000 yen (~$301,000 USD)
but in reality it is a bit more than this because people often deposit more
than 100,000 yen at a time.  
  
This is just the beginning......
