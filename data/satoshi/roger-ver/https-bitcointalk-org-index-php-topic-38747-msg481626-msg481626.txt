As someone who flew to the conference all the way from Tokyo, I can say that
the conference was a HUGE success.  
I don't regret attending at all.  
I'm sorry there was not live streaming on the web, but that doesn't change the
fact that there was am amazing amount of collaboration that went on at the
conference. I was especially impressed with the Bitcoin ATM information, the
BTCinch.com and bit-pay.com guys.  
They have some awesome tools in the works. I met so many sharp minds, and so
many new Bitcoin ideas were created.  
  
In short, the conference was a huge success for everyone who attended, and I
am more excited about Bitcoin's future than ever before.
