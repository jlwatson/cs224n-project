I thought the whole point of penny auctions is that the time keeps extending
every time there is a bid.  
  
I really like your site and think you could be onto something here.  
  
Someone just needs to set up an automated / easy way to convert credits to and
from Bitcoins.  
  
Would it be illegal to just use Bitcents for everything instead of credits?  
  
I just posted some nice 16GB USB flash drives for sale on your site.

Good luck with it!
