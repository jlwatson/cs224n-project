I run a company of a little over 30 people. We recently have stated accepting
bitcoin as payment and ran into our first security issue recently.  
It then occurred to me how incredibly difficult it will be for companies to
manage their bitcoins.  
With bitcoins, it just takes one honest mistake, or one dishonest action by
any single person in the accounting department who has access to the bitcoin
wallet to lose all of the bitcoins. Many companies need hundreds of thousands
or millions of dollars in checking accounts to take care of ongoing company
expenses.  
  
What steps can companies take to prevent one employee from transferring all of
the money away?  
  
What steps can be taken to prevent an accountant at Microsoft for example,
from stealing $100M worth of bitcoins in one shot?  
  
Please give me your thoughts on security measures that companies will need to
take to prevent the theft of all of their bitcoins.  
Having the owner handle every single transaction personally is not practical
for organizations of any size.  
In order for bitcoin to become mainstream, these problems will need to be
solved.
