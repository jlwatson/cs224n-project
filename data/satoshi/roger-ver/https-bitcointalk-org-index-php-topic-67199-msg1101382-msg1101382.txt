  
1\. It is my problem because it was my money that was stolen.  
  
2\. There was a deal in the works for Bitcoinica to be sold for enough money
to cover the entire shortfall for returning customer funds. That deal fell
apart because Amir open sourced the code. Open sourcing it destroyed most of
its value in the eyes of the potential buyers.  
  
3\. Between Amir, Patrick, and Donald, they had total control. All we needed
was for two of the three to cooperate and every creditor would be much better
off today, and likely have %100 of their money back. Instead Patrick lied to
me via email, and again right to my face when I met him in SF. Amir and Donald
refused to even reply to emails.  
  
The best thing they the three of them can do for Bitcoin is to leave forever!
