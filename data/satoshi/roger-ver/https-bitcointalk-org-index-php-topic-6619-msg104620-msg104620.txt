I have one 30 second live read per show, and one 30 second recorded ad per
show.  
I am willing to donate both of them to bitcoin.  
  
For the live read, what do you think of this:  
  
  
 _ **Are you tired of watching the value of the dollar plummet?  
Are you tired of governments being able to monitor your finances?  
Do you want to earn a lot of money?  
In the last year, Gold is up 30%, Silver is up 145%, Bitcoins are up more than
800%!  
Bitcoin is the worlds first decentralized, anonymous currency and is gaining
popularity every day.  
You can use them in any country around the world to buy or sell just about
anything.

Please critique the above.  
  
And if anyone needs any networking gear, I am happy to accept payment in
bitcoins for anything on my website.  
http://www.memorydealers.com (we should be able to accept bitcoins in real
time on the site in about two weeks. the new site is under construction
currently.)
