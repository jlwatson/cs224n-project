All you have to do is read what Roger Ver himself wrote in that thread. He
said himself that he has access to a lot of information about account holders
and their accounts, and we can see for ourselves in the email chain he posted
that he was prepared to leverage this information to resolve a customer
service dispute in a completely unrelated business.  

  
You have this wrong.  
The only information I threatened to leverage was the information from
Bitcoinstore, the business directly involved in the incident.  
I never made any of the information from Blockchain public.
