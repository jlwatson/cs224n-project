I hope your store is real, but as someone who has been in business over a
decade, lots of things point to scam for me:  
  
1\. No contact information on your website.  
2\. Private domain name registration  
3\. Your shipping rates are unbelievably low.  
  
Please provide some real contact information so we can believe you.  
  
Other than that, your site looks great.  
I wish my team for Bitcoinstore.com could have done as nice a job.
