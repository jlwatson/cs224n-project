I actually emailed Alex Jones a few weeks ago asking for a quote on what it
would cost to run some Bitcoin adds on his show.  
No one got back to me at all.  
  
Here was the email I sent:

Subject: Bitcoin Advertising  
  
I am interested in advertising bitcoins on your website and radio show.  
Im currently running the following bitcoin add on Free Talk Live.

I am interested in doing a similar add and live read on your show as well as
some links from your website.  
  
Can you give me an idea of what something like this would cost?  
Im interested in doing this because I think bitcoins are the best way to take
away power from the government and banksters, and give people back control of
their own money.  
If you dont know what bitcoins are, please visit www.bitcoin.org  
  
Thanks so much!
