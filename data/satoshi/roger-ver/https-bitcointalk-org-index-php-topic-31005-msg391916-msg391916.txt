I actually emailed Alex Jones a few weeks ago asking for a quote on what it
would cost to run some Bitcoin adds on his show.
No one got back to me at all.

Here was the email I sent:

I am interested in advertising bitcoins on your website and radio show.
I'm currently running the following bitcoin add on Free Talk Live.

I am interested in doing a similar add and live read on your show as well as
some links from your website.

Can you give me an idea of what something like this would cost?
Im interested in doing this because I think bitcoins are the best way to take
away power from the government and banksters, and give people back control of
their own money.
