I did some price comparisons and BitcoinStore is actually cheaper this time
(unlike during beta when "cheaper than Amazon" really meant "cheaper than some
third-party sellers on Amazon").

MtGox $31.56 Bitcoinstore $31.42

The hidden 1% fee due to the exchange rate used is a bit deceptive. I would
rather just see higher prices with the proper exchange rate.  

  
$0.16 difference does NOT equal a 1% fee.  
  
The MTGOX price displayed is the most recent trade value on MTGOX.  
The BitcoinStore price is based on the highest ask price on MTGOX.  
  
Sometimes this value is the same, sometimes there is a spread, but you will
always get more via BitcoinStore.com than you would by selling your coins on
MTGOX at the same instant.
