Bitcoin addresses of all users were removed by me in order to implement new
system for enhanced security.  
Additional details will be available shortly.  
  
I found that someone changed bitcoin addresses of some users. I'm not sure how
the attacker got passwords, but now you'll have to use e-mail confirmation for
changing your wallet address.  
I'm very sorry that I haven't implemented this feature earlier, so your stolen
bitcoins **will be reimbursed**.  
(Please note: I can't garantee that I can do such reimbursment in the future).  
  
Your money is safe and i'll give instructions on setting your address again.
Please wait.  
  
A total of ~150 BTC were stolen: 136 from this user **and ~14 BTC from
others**.  

  
Wow!  
That is very generous of you!  
Can I ask about how many users had their bitcoin addresses changed?  
So this sounds like it means that none of my employees violated my trust. (I'm
still implementing stronger security measures.)  
Would you agree?  
  
I have been worried all day about who could be a thief at my company.  
I was worried even more about it than the missing bitcoins.  
  
Thank you again, and I will gladly continue mining with deepbit because of
your help! (I'll keep a much lower balance though)
