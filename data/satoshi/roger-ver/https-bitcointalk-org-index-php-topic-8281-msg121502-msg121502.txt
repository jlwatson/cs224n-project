  
Wow!  
That is very generous of you!  
Can I ask about how many users had their bitcoin addresses changed?  
So this sounds like it means that none of my employees violated my trust. (I'm
still implementing stronger security measures.)  
Would you agree?  
  
I have been worried all day about who could be a thief at my company.  
I was worried even more about it than the missing bitcoins.  
  
Thank you again, and I will gladly continue mining with deepbit because of
your help! (I'll keep a much lower balance though)
