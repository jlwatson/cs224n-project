interesting project but also a controversial one. what happens, if i post a
"crime" which isnt a crime in your country? who decides which "crime" is worth
a bounty and which is not? i also could fake informations or make wrongful
allegations.  

  
Until a distributed system is developed, I will be moderating what bounties
are allowed and what are not.  
I will only be allowing bounties for crimes in which there is a clear victim.
