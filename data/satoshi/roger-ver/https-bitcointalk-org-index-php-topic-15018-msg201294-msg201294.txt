I'm starting to wonder if governments, banks, or someone else is trying to
flood the forum with FUD.  
There are so many posts that at first glance make you worry.  
I'll be interested to see how this one turns out too.  
  
I have had no problems at all with any of my trades at MTGOX.  
I'll give tradehill a try in the future as well.
