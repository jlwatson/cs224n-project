I just came across this scammer website: www.bitcoinestore.com (with an E
after bitcoin)  
  
It has NOTHING to do with the real www.bitcoinstore.com (no extra e)  
  
They are even claiming that the scammer site is powered by memorydealers.com  
  
I've already reported it to http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/  
  
Any ideas what else can be done?
