Thank you CDHowie!  
I heard the show as well.  
You did a great job!  
  
Would you or someone else (Gavin?) on this forum be willing to do an interview
with Mark Edge? (Co-Host of Free Talk Live)  
He often does interviews that they attach to the end of the podcast.  
I think each podcast is downloaded about 10,000 times on average, so it would
be a good way to reach at least that many people.  
  
I'm not sure, but I would guess that Mark would be interested in this as well.  
  
Any thoughts?
