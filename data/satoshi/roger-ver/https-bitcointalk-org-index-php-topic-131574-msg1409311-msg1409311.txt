There is no way for an admin or anyone else in the entire world other than
someone who knows the current password to change the password.  
If you kept your password a secret, then no one else in the entire world has
access to the funds in your blockchain wallet.  

  
How can anyone trust you after this?  

  
You don't have to trust me because the code is open source.
