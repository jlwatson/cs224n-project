Meanwhile, I just received a PM from Rassah and a Bitcoin vanity address has
been hashed: 1THRF26KAsDDLh1JyWB5Hbm5mYgN6LwZt. I do not have access to the
private key of this address. Currently, only Rassah does, and should be
providing a copy to Roger Ver via a secure channel in the very near future.  

  
I confirm I have a copy of the private key.  
  
I'll keep it nice and safe.  
  
Roger Ver
