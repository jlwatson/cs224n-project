Instead, Amir posted the source code causing additional money to be stolen,
and no one has received any of their money back yet.  

  
Roger, I've been extremely critical of the Intersango guys and the way they've
handled this clusterfuck for a very long time but even I don't buy the idea
that the Bitcoinica MtGox account was breached because Amir leaked the code.
Are you telling me that you seriously believe Zhou's explanation of the MtGox
breach and how someone who just happened to have his credentials (but who
doesn't read this forum) also just happened to come across the leaked code and
then also happened to think that the MtGox API keys might be a password to
something else? Seriously? Because given Zhou's ridiculous story about the
MtGox breach, I wouldn't even trust his explanation of the Rackspace breach.  
  
There are plenty of legitimate grounds on which to criticise the way that
Donald, Patrick and Amir have handled the whole Bitcoinica disaster. Let's not
damage our own credibility by pretending to believe in the absurd.  
  
  

  
You may be right that Amir open sourcing the code did not lead to the second
hack, but it did destroy the one asset that Bitcoinica still had that could be
sold to pay back all the creditors. Amir destroyed that option when he posted
the source code.
