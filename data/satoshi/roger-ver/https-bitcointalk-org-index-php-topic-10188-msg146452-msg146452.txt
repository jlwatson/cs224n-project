For those who don't know, Fredric Bastiat was one of the leading libertarians
of his day.  
Reading his book "The Law" will change your view of government and "Legal
Plunder"  
  
He had such great quotes as:  
  
The state is the great fictitious entity by which everyone seeks to live at
the expense of everyone else.  
  
When goods do not cross borders, soldiers will.  
  
Everyone wants to live at the expense of the state. They forget that the
state wants to live at the expense of everyone.  
  
I'm not sure how this thread fits into Bitcoin discussion, but I think Bastiat
would LOVE the idea of bitcoins if he were alive today.
