CharlieContent, This issue has been settled now.  
Blockchain.info user funds wer safe, and currently are safe.  
At no point was anyone's money in any danger whatsoever.  
  
I no longer have access to any part of Blockchain.info's admin pannel.  
  
I think you should change the thread title, or better yet, lock the thread and
ask the mods to delete it.

Certainly not.  
  
This insistence on covering up is even more concerning than the initial abuse,
for that matter.  

  
If you want to start a separate thread about me covering something up, feel
free, but every single issue that was brought up in the initial post of this
thread has been solved. Therefore the thread title is not true, and should be
changed so as not to cause undue alarm.
