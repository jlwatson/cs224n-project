I was just told that Moon Kim is competing in the biggest poker tournament of
the year starting on July 7th in Las Vegas and finishing on the 16th.  
He has promised to wear the Bitcoin T-shirt every day of the competition.  
First prize is more than $10,000,000 USD.  
  
I will post photos when they are available.
