I want to know every informations that an admin of blockchain.info can see.  
I thought that most of them were encrypted...  

  
It is all encrypted, but it depends on your privacy settings.  
  
Quoted from: https://blockchain.info/wallet/anonymity  
  
 _Alerts Disabled: If you have notifications disabled your public keys are
stored encrypted inside your wallet. In this mode we are unable to view your
public keys and hence cannot view your balance or transactions.  
  
  
Alerts Enabled: When notifications are enabled your public keys are inserted
in a separate table along with your email, skype handle or google talk
username. This mode does sacrifice some Anonymity as we can now see your
public keys and view your wallet balance. However just because a wallet
contains a public key does not necessarily mean they are the owner of said key
(as you can add keys without the respective private key).  
_  
In this case the scammer with my bitcoins had Alerts enabled for his wallet,
so I could easily verify %100 for sure that he has my money in his Blockchain
wallet.  
  
If he had his alerts set to Disabled, I wouldn't know if he really had my
money or not.
