I think everyone should keep in mind that the real person/group to be angry
with is the hackers, not Bitcoinica.  
Anyone who is smart enough to figure out how to steal 18K BTC from Bitcoinica
is more than smart enough to do honest work. I hope Zhou goes on to have a
long successful career while the hackers and other thieves burn in hell.  
  
 **Direct your anger towards the hackers!**
