So no one took this bet, right? I do not see it on the site.  

  
No one took the bet, but it is still listed on the site:

Earlier today I asked Peter Schiff if he would be interested in the opposing

One of the first books I read out of high school was one written by his dad,
Irwin Schiff. To this day, the IRS has not gotten their fair share out of my
ass due to his writings. The first time I ever lived in Las Vegas, I went out
of my way to drive by one of his old offices (building). It was my way of
paying homage to Mecca.

I also read some of his dad's book around the time I graduated high school.  
It is shameful the way the USA government has treated him.  
He is surely a political prisoner
