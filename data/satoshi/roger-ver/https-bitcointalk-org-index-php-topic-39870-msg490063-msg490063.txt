Yeah, but you're having the coins controlled by someone who thinks it's a
girls fault if she gets raped and who is now linked to illegal acts in a place
he is trying to go back to with bitcoin.  
  
But ok, nice to know you endorse all of that.  

  
The coins are being held by MTGOX and I think you should look up the
definition of "Non sequitur"  
(Latin for "it does not follow"), in formal logic, is an argument in which its
conclusion does not follow from its premises
