It occurred to me that the Bitcoin world would love a similar widget to this:  
  
  
But using bitcoins.  
  
  
Does anyone have any idea how hard it would be to program something like that?  
It would monitor the block chain for the number of donations sent to a
particular address, and automatically convert the amount into a chart for the
equivalent number of USD based on the exchange rate.  
  
This is just a thought, but one that I think the Bitcoin world would like to
see.  
  
I already contacted easywallet.org and blockchain.info mentioning that this
service would be a nice addition to their sites.
