I've noticed that when sending BTC via SMS, if the BTC are not claimed within
a certain amount of time, they disappear.  
  
Here is an example from my own account.  
As a test, I sent 1 BTC to my own cell phone number and intentionally never
claimed the BTC.  
Now when I check my wallet history or click the link from the SMS, it says
that the funds are gone.  
  
  
  
This is the first time I confirmed it %100 for sure, but I am 99.9% sure this
has happened with lots of other Bitcoins I have sent to people who didn't know
how to claim them.  
Can you let us know what is happening to these Bitcoins?  
  
How's the new server?
