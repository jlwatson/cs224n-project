Here are a list of people who I asked,  and they basically said they don't or rarely use Bitcoin:

* Jimmy Song
* Eric Lombrozo
* Luke-jr
* [Tone Vays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p00KLywjq7U)
* Johnny Dilley
* [Adam Meister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzube7_PoCw)
* Many more.....

I suspect the rest of the Core supporters aren't tansacting with BTC either...
