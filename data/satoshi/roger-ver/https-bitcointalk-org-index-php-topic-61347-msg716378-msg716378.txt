Half baked logic. George's money was created by society, it was given to him
by society and he only keeps it because society provides him security. So the
amount he has is not his decision, its a collective decision.  

  
So you are saying that it is ok to use violence against George in order to
take back what was given to him by society?  
  
When you say "money" do you mean wealth, or government issued currency?  
  
I'm not trying to start a flame war.  
To me it seems so clear that it is not OK to use violence against George, so I
am trying hard to understand how anyone else could see it so differently.
