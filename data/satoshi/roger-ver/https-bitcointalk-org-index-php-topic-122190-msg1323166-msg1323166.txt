They really need to use USPS for international orders to deal with these
outrageous shipping costs.  

USPS will be an international shipping method very soon. I already applied for
the account and am just waiting to receive the API credentials from USPS.
Hopefully it can be online within this week!

For a Bitcoin only store it would be cool to implement some mouse-over effect
to display the Éƒ-price of items or even better the $ on mouse-over.  

Now prices for all items are displayed in BTC and USD

On a related note you may wish to take places such as Cuba, North Korea, Iran
etc. out of your country list if you do not wish to run afoul of legislation
in the United States. Seriously.  

Done. Thank you for the advice.

Any plans on selling food on BitcoinStore? That would be awesome!  

This is an interesting idea that I will look into, but it wont be in the
immediate future.

Would like to see brand names in the links on the browse pages. Hard to
navigate things that are just generically named like "20 inch monitor...".  

Still working on this, but it will happen very soon.

Price range links don't seem to work. In fact, categorization in general
doesn't seem to be correct at all.  

Price range links are fixed. If you have other categorization suggestions,
please post them here.

Meh. How about we just get that bitcoin debit card already and then buy direct
from Amazon.  

Because Bitcoinstore.com is cheaper than Amazon for lots of things, and
especially so after you consider the fees that will be involved in loading the
card.  
  
  
 **Thank you to everyone who has already placed an order!**
