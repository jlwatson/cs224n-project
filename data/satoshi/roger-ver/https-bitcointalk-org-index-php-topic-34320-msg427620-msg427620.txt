That seems clear enough with the exception of changing the word "ALL" to
"whichever performs the best relative to the USD" and remove the mention of
outperforming the USD on your youtube post since as stated $1 will still be $1
in 2 years.  
  
For $10,000 I would be willing to take the other side of this bet while at the
same time hoping you win. The only cavaat is that I am not sure I can agree to
the charity aspect of the payout.  

  
If Bitcoin outperforms "ALL" of them, then it will certainly have outperformed
whichever "one" that performs best relative to the USD.  
  
I think it might be illegal in one of our jurisdictions if the money is not
donated to charity, and that is one of the rules for www.longbets.org  
They hold the money in Escrow until the bet is resolved.
