How bout expanding your operations to include more consumer items a la NewEgg?
Granted you can't really compete on price but if things were within 5-10% I
would certainly user your store. I would commit to 500$+ in random gear (maybe
hard drives, usb drives, memory, monitors, etc)  

  
This is something I can do and can surely come within 10% of NewEgg's prices,
and likely much closer.  
  
I will report back when I have an update.
