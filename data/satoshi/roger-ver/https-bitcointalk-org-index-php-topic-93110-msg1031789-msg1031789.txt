  
I deposited this many Bitcoins because I have spoken with Zhou many times on
skype / email about various things.  
I also have spoken with Tihan on the phone for close to an hour.  
Between the two of them, I felt safe keeping my money on deposit with them.  
  
While I do feel bad for everyone at Bitcoinica, the fact that they were hacked
is not their user's problem.  
I still hope that whoever is currently behind Bitcoinca will step up and do
the right thing.
