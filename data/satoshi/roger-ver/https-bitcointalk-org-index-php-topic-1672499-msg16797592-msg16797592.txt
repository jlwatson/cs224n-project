This article is completely wrong, and the guy who posted it is a complete liar
for intentionally misrepresenting what I said by taking it out of context.  
I was explaining that the Bitcoin.com pool pays more than other mining pools.
He said this was possible, so I explained to him how it was possible.  
  
Here is the chat log so you can see for yourself what was going on:

The guy who lied on twitter should be ashamed.
