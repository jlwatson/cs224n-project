The mention of bitcoins wont be live on the English site for about 2 more
weeks.  
I'll post on here as soon as it is live.  
  
I think I can have it live on the Japanese site by tomorrow.

I will post it on our twitter feed and facebook page now though.  
  
If you want to buy anything, email me a list or screen shot of the items you
want at roger@memorydealers.com  
  
I'm happy to accept bitcoins at whatever the going rate is on mtgox  
  
  
Once I have a decent amount of bitcoins in my account, I will start asking my
vendors to accept them as payment.  
I think that will really help get things started!
