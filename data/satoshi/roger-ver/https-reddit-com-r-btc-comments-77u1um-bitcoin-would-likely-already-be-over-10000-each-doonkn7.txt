> Since nobody is actually SPENDING Bitcoin in any significant way

I disagree with this point strongly.  I and many other people around the world are using Bitcoin for commerce.  Just earlier today I paid over $600 in fees for a single transaction on the Bitcoin network to pay a single entity for Bitcoin.com.  I can't wait to be able to move more of my business over to a currency that doesn't cost $600 in fees to make a single payment.  Right now Bitcoin Cash is at the top of that list.
