I'm starting a Bitcoin national radio campaign.  
It will run on a nationally syndicated radio program on about 100 stations
nationwide, including XM satellite radio, 6 days per week.  
http://www.freetalklive.com/affiliates (I think many listeners will already be
interested in something like bitcoin)  
  
The Bitcoin ad will be a 30 live read and a 30 second recorded ad, each will
run 6 times per week. (12 ads total)  
  
I currently am paying $2500 USD a month for my ad contract.  
For anyone who would like to help out with the cost, you are welcome to chip
in a few bitcoins. (you can make a pledge by posting below.)  
  
My current radio ad is this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_wPsvmEG6A (We
will replace this with a bitcoin ad)  
  
  
I've posted the sample wording for the ad in a post below, please read it and
give me your thoughts.
