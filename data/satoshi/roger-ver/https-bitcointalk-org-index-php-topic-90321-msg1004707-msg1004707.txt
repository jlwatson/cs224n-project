Can you please reply specifically to me? It's not very helpful the way you
phrased it. How about I pay you 1 BTC for the 4 timestamps...  

  
Sorry, I was too busy to track down who sent me which videos.  
I know how to easily make them myself, but I am too busy with too many things,
that is why I tried to offer a bounty to have them made, but it is turning
into more work than if I had just made the videos myself.  
Not to mention that the content is getting stale now.
