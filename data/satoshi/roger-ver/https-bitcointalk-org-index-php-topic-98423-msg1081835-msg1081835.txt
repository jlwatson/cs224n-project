Hi guys,  
Thank you for your concern.  
While I am upset about the Bitcoinica loss, it won't stop me from continuing
with my Bitcoin projects.  
  
Some big things will be coming soon!  
  
Currently I am trying to find the owner of Blockchain **.COM** (Not .info)  
  
Can anyone help put me in contact with him?
