There are PNB branches in the States. I would like to see if I can get a
Bitcoin exchange account linked to a PNB account. I don't think it would be
directly linked to the Philippines, but it should make it easier to transfer
money.  

  
Is this something Bitinstant.com should be interested in?  
Can you post more details since I don't know anything about PNB?
