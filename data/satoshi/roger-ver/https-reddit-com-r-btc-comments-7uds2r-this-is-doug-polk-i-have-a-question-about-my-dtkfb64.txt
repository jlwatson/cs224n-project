Sounds like you should steer to a listening comprehension class.  I never said things were fine at MtGox.  I only said that their fiat withdrawal delays were caused by the traditional banking system. Even today,  we know that everything I said in the video was true.  (Although I regret making it for them since obviously everything was not fine there)
