People in Europe can buy Bitcoins with a CC or Paypal from me.  
On the 25BTC coins the premium is not too bad, and any customer with a CC or
paypal can currently buy Bitcoins through  
http://www.memorydealers.com/bieq.html  
  
Sales inside the USA have been huge, but just a few from Europe.  
  
If you have Euros or Pounds, and want to buy Bitcoins, this might be the
easiest way.  
  
Please help me spread the word.
