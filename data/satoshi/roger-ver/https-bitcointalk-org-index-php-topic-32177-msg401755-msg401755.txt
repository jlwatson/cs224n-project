I actually don't believe in the Illuminati conspiracy theories, but I do know
that Alex Jones has a HUGE audience and many of them would be very interested
in the idea of Bitcoins.

I decided to send the following email:

I am interested in advertising bitcoins on your website and radio show.
I'm currently running the following bitcoin add on Free Talk Live.

I am interested in doing a similar add and live read on your show as well as
some links from your website.

Can you give me an idea of what something like this would cost?
Im interested in doing this because I think bitcoins are the best way to take
away power from the government and banksters, and give people back control of
their own money.
If you dont know what bitcoins are, please visit www.bitcoin.org

Thanks so much!

2.5 weeks went by with no reply at all, so I emailed them again:

I replied right away with:

Is there a waiting list?
Can you send me some pricing so I can have an idea of what it would cost?

To date there as been no reply.
Their response (or lack of) seems very very strange to me.

Any thoughts on what is going on?
