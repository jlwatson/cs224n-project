I don't really care about moral arguments against taxation because they boil
down to semantics. Wether you're paying a government or private security
firms, research organizations, road owners, etc. it doesn't make a difference.  
  

  
You are avoiding the question at hand.  
  
McDonalds has never threatened to lock me in a cage if I refuse to buy their
Hamburger.  
  
The US Government threatens to lock me in a cage if I refuse to pay for their
wars.  
  
This is much more than mere semantics.
