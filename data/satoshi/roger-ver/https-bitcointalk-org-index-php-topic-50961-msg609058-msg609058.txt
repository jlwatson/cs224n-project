As someone who has seen the 25BTC Casascius coins in person,  
  
**I can honestly say that they are the most beautiful coins I have ever
seen.**  
  
  
Anyone will be taken aback by their beauty when they see them for the first
time, and will be happy to receive them as a gift weather or not they have
ever heard of Bitcoins.  
  
Mike, can you post some photos of these?  
Specifically the side where the holograms are attached.  
I've never seen a photo of these online before.  
  
I love the idea of making a gift set using these.
