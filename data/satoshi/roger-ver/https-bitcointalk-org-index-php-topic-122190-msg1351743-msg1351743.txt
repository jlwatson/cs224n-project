any deals for cyber monday or black friday or thanksgiving? Do you have access
to the same promotions that best buy, tigerdirect get? or are you not in that
realm at this point?  
  
I'd love to be able to pass along links to amazing deals to others and help
them get bicoins to buy them!  

  
We are still in Beta, so I don't think we will have any black friday deals or
cyber monday deals until next year.
