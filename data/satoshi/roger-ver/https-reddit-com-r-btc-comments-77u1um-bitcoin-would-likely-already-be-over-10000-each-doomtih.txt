I'm not sure what part of the logic you don't follow but I'm happy to expand.  When things cost more,  people will use less of it and seek substitutes.  When Bitcoin never had full blocks,  the fees were cheap and the transactions were reliable.  As soon as the blocks became full the transactions became expensive and unreliable so people started to use altcoins as a replacement for Bitcoin.  If those people had continued to use cheap reliable Bitcoin with bigger blocks, the price would already be well over $10,000 because of it.
