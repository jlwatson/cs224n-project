  
The below problem has been resolved.  
Thank you Instawallet!  
  
  
 _It seems that someone is trying to attack Instawallet.org  
  
There have been more than 50K new wallets created in the last few minutes or
so. (From less than 2M to over 2.05M )  
If you watch the page, the number of wallets is increasing faster than the eye
can follow.  
  
My recent instawallet deposit has also not been credited into my account.  
  
What is going on, and what can the community do to help?  
  
(If someone knows the owners, please contact them)_
