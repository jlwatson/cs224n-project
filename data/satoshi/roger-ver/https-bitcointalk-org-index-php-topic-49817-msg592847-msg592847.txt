I don't understand these people.  
  
With the skill set and effort involved in making that fake site, they could
just as easily provide a real good or service that people want, and make an
honest living.  
  
A few years back I had a similar problem with www.memorydealerS.com vs
www.memorydealer(no S).com  
  
For a few thousand dollars ICANN was able to reassign the domain to myself.  
  
It might also be worth it in your case.  
  
There are lots of lawyers that do this kind of thing.
