 _Bitcoinstore's policy is to price goods in USD while using a current
exchange rate. Because hosted wallets often don't immediately broadcast
transactions, we highly recommend not using hosted wallets to pay for orders
since there is a high likelihood their transaction broadcast delays will cause
unnecessary disruption for both us and you. Examples of hosted wallets NOT to
use for this kind of payment arewww.mtgox.com www.bitstamp.net and
www.coinbase.com  
Bitcoinstore.com recommends our users use the bitcoin wallets from
www.blockchain.info/wallet or http://electrum.org/_  
  
Please feel free to add any additional critiques.
