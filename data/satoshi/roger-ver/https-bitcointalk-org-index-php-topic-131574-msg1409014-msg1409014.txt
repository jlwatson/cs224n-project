  
The current privacy policy states:  
  
  
 _But we will disclose these information ...... **to protect against misuse or
unauthorized use of our website.**_  
  
I think this falls pretty clearly within that.  
  
He has also since threatened my family with the following statement that is
obviously directed towards me: **"FuckingTheDeadBodyOfRogersMom"**  
(My name is Roger)  
  
Does anyone have an opinion on if it would be worthwhile to try contacting the
Greek police in regards to the above threat?
