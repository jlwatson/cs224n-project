Otherwise I could have reset your password and taken the money you owe me.  

  
Wow. What a scumbag.  
  
Why should anyone trust you after this? After all, you have no problems going
into people's accounts and just taking what you think you are owed in a
completely separate business venture. You claim not to be capable, but I'm not
sure that I believe a word you say.  
  
BlockChain.info says: "Be your own bank"  
  
What it actually means is: "Open an account at the Roger Ver Bank."  

  
Please look up the difference between " _could_ " and " _would_ "  
  
I _would_ never do such a thing even if I _could_.
