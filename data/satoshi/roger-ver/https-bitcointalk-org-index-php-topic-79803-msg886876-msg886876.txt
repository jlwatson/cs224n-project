Based on the response I have so far, I am sure we could get a turnout of
several hundred people if I planned it more than one day in advance.  
  
Maybe I will put together something further in advance for next year.  
  
Almost all the Chinese who have heard about Bitcoins are very interested.  
  
I'm already sure that this trip will start a fair amount of legitimate
business, paid via Bitcoins, between some Chinese suppliers and Russian
customers.  
(both countries have strict currency controls)  
  
I will report back after the actual meeting.
