My best friend's good friend, (Moon Kim) recently won $960K in a poker
tournament.  
He is the guy in red holding the trophy:

Moon will compete in a large poker tournament in Las Vegas from May 18th.  
I don't have the exact details for the tournament yet, but I suspect it will
be televised.

Moon has agreed that he, and his group will all wear Bitcoin shirts durring
the tournament.  
  
He has requested 8 Mens L size shirts.  
  
Which Bitcoin design shirt will be best for this opportunity?  
Ideally it should be one that is Bitcoin & Poker related.  
  
Lets jump on this opportunity ASAP!
