 **1\. No contact information on your website.**  
By far the easiest way of communicating to us is via email. We are based in
Australia, meaning that our admin staff is generally asleep while the majority
of our consumers are browsing our website (also the reason it has taken so
long to respond here). If you really want to talk over the phone that can be
arranged, however at this stage email will definitely work best. If our store
is well-received we will be outsourcing support staff, however this will only
happen if CoinsForTech.com proves profitable.

This can easily be solved. Post your contact details today.  
Here is what it looks like for a normal business:

addresses)

 **2\. Private domain name registration**  
This was done for free when we registered our domains with NameCheap. I'm
aware it does not scream confidence, and sincerely hope it does not affect our
sales.

So log into your NameCheap account and disable it today.

 **3\. Your shipping rates are unbelievably low.**  
I disagree that they are unbelievably low, however I have very little
experience with shipping out of the United States.  
  
Having said this, our shipping rates into the US are artificially low. We have
subsidised them to keep the costs down to remain attractive to US buyers. The
shipping costs to rest of the countries are at cost price.  

  
All of your rates are unbelievably low if the goods are shipping from
Australia.  
Here is Fedex's rate card for Economy
shipping:http://images.fedex.com/downloads/au/rates/ie_2013.pdf  
If you ship enough packages per month, you can get about a 50% discount from
their published rates.  
DHL's rates are similar.  
  
Here are some examples that I can't believe even after assuming you are
getting a 50% discount from Fedex:  
  
  
1.0 KG to Asia You claim: $17 Fedex reality $51  
3.0 KG to Asia You claim: $31 Fedex reality $85  
5.0 KG to Asia You claim: $44 Fedex reality $112  
  
  
1.0 KG to Europe You claim: $29 Fedex reality $62  
3.0 KG to Europe You claim: $37 Fedex reality $110  
5.0 KG to Europe You claim: $48 Fedex reality $155  
  
1.0 KG to Middle East You claim: $30 Fedex reality $83  
3.0 KG to Middle East You claim: $64 Fedex reality $148  
5.0 KG to Middle East You claim: $93 Fedex reality $209  
  
  
Clearly something doesn't add up with your claim that shipping to the above
"countries are at cost price.'  
  
Bitcoin needs more merchants, and I hope you are an honest one, but the
evidence above leads me to think otherwise.  
If you intend to have a successful business, you will need to address items 1
and 2 right away.
