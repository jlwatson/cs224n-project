All of your rates are unbelievably low if the goods are shipping from
Australia.  
Here is Fedex's rate card for Economy
shipping:http://images.fedex.com/downloads/au/rates/ie_2013.pdf  
If you ship enough packages per month, you can get about a 50% discount from
their published rates.  
DHL's rates are similar.  
  
Here are some examples that I can't believe even after assuming you are
getting a 50% discount from Fedex:  
  
  
1.0 KG to Asia You claim: $17 Fedex reality $51  
3.0 KG to Asia You claim: $31 Fedex reality $85  
5.0 KG to Asia You claim: $44 Fedex reality $112  
  
  
1.0 KG to Europe You claim: $29 Fedex reality $62  
3.0 KG to Europe You claim: $37 Fedex reality $110  
5.0 KG to Europe You claim: $48 Fedex reality $155  
  
1.0 KG to Middle East You claim: $30 Fedex reality $83  
3.0 KG to Middle East You claim: $64 Fedex reality $148  
5.0 KG to Middle East You claim: $93 Fedex reality $209  
  
  
Clearly something doesn't add up with your claim that shipping to the above
"countries are at cost price.'  
  
Bitcoin needs more merchants, and I hope you are an honest one, but the
evidence above leads me to think otherwise.  
If you intend to have a successful business, you will need to address items 1
and 2 right away.
