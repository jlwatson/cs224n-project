On a similar vein, memorydealers, if you are reading this, I have no idea what
happened to the 3 BTC I donated to one of the earlier 'charity' efforts which
was escrowed by Bruce (or at least that was the initial plan.) I was to
humiliated to see if there was any accounting or follow-up. If that wallet is
still kicking around and funded and in your control, I'm happy if you remove
the 3 BTC and use it toward this cause.  
  

  
3 BTC sent on behalf of tvbcof  
  
I'll update the Bitcoin for charity thread soon as well.
