The conferences are actually organized by a different networking group.  
I'm helping explain what Bitcoins are and how they work to everyone.  
I will be giving Bitcoin seminars almost every work day for the next few weeks
all across Japan.  
I think this is the start of great things for Bitcoin in Japan.
