The bitcoin logo and link is now live on www.memorydealers.jp  
  
It will be live on the English site in about two weeks.  
  
My friend also runs http://www.lewt.com/  
  
I'm pretty sure he can be willing to accept bitcoin.  
I will talk to him a bit more about putting it online.  
  
If you guys have any more ideas on what I can do to help promote bitcoin,
please let me know!
