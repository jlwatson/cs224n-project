I think it is rather clear for those who spend the time to think about it.  
  
Libertarians are happy to leave other people with the freedom to say "no" I
don't want to participate in XX activity.  
  
Statists, want to take away my freedom to say "no", I don't want to
participate in XX activity.  
  
I'm happy to allow Atlas to do whatever he wants as long as I don't have to
participate.  
  
Unfortunately, Atlas would advocate that force and violence be used against me
to compel me participate in whatever government plan he is advocating.  
  
Because of people who share Atlas' world view, I don't have the "freedom" to
say "no", I won't participate with social security, medicare, public schools,
socialized medicine, etc.  
  
I think it is clear who is advocating freedom, and who is advocating
compulsion.  
  
Bitcoin tips the balance of power in favor of those who value freedom.  
That is why so many libertarian types are attracted to Bitcoin. (Myself
included)
