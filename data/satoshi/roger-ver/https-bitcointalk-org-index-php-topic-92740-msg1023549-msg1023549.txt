I just got off the phone with the co-host (Mark Edge) of a nationally
syndicated radio program on more than 100 stations across the USA.  
http://www.freetalklive.com/  
  
He is %100 on board with Bitcoins and wants the show to become more Bitcoin
centric.  
They have been super generous with Bitcoin Interviews on their show:  
  
Charlie Shrem on Free Talk Live April 19, 2012 Topic Bitcoin and Bitinstant  
Ira Miller on Free Talk Live about Bitcoin, Bitinstant, Liberty forum  
Roger Ver Bitcoin Interview on Free Talk Live at Porcfest 2012  
Erik Voorhees Bitcoin Interview on Free Talk Live at Porcfest 2012  
Bitcoin on Free Talk Live 5-9-2011  
Bitcoin interview on more than 100 Radio stations across the USA!  
Bitcoin Free Talk Live Radio commercial on more than 100 stations!  
  
and many many more that I didn't have time to put on youtube.  
  
  
I've been paying for various Bitcoin adds on the show for the last year.  
The adds include a 30 second live read each day, but recently they have been
doing several minute long Bitcoin discussions in lieu.  
  
Current Bitcoin related advertisers are:  
Bitinstant.com (My live read)  
weusecoins.org  (My recorded ad)  
SpendBitcoins.com  
minethings.com  
  
He would like to find other Bitcoin related advertisers for the show.  
He is more than willing to accept payment in Bitcoin.  
  
Some ideas that come to my mind for new advertisers are:  
  
www.bid-pay.com  
www.blockchain.info  
www.bitvapes.com  
www.cigs.eu  
www.satoshidice.com  
www.paysius.com  
  
 _ **What other Bitcoin related business do you think might actually be
willing to pay money for some radio ads?**_
