Hello everyone!  
  
My name is Nejc Kodrič, co-founder and CEO of Bitstamp.  
  
I got got introduced to bitcoin by my colleague and now co-founder of
Bitstamp, Damijan Merlak. We both soon started mining bitcoins. Later we
figured there is a need for EU domiciled exchange. So we build it. Bitstamp
was launched in August 2011.  
  
Bitcoin industry was much different. Not many people have heard about it and
banks & policy makers didn't care about it - it was simply too small.  
Whenever it was mentioned in the news, it always had somewhat negative
connotation. I'm very glad that I was around when bitcoin made it's first
steps. As many of you probably also know. It's a great story!  
  
I am excited to be participating in Bitcoin.com's mother of all AMA and will
be answering all day today. Please give me some time to respond.  
  
Best regards
