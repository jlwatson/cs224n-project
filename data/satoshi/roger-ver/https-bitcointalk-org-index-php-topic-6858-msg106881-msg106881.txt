I should have waited with my order T_T  
  
Anyway, the shirt is worth it  

  
Heh, price deflation is a strange world - and the shirt is a great
conversation starter. I wore mine to an anarchist potluck last night and
within an hour btc was the party's main topic of conversation  

  
How can I find an anarchist potluck near where I live?  
Sounds like a wonderful time!
