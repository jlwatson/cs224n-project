Quote from: Andreas M. Antonopoulos

Hello!  
  
I am Andreas M. Antonopoulos. I've been involved in bitcoin for 4 years, 3 of
those as my full-time and only occupation.  
  
I'm a computer scientist with a Master's degree in Data Communications and
have been coding since I was 11. For two decades I was a freelance security
consultant, system administrator, IT manager and developer in a wide variety
of roles. I've spent a lot of time working in the data centers of financial
services companies.  
  
Once I discovered bitcoin and realized the power of this technology, I
switched my focus entirely to bitcoin. I've written a technical book
"Mastering Bitcoin" which is published by O'Reilly Media and also available as
an open source title. The book is currently being translated into more than 30
languages and can be read for free in 5 languages.  
  
You can buy the book from Amazon here:

Cryptocurrencies/dp/1449374042  
  
The source code for the book is here:

I spend most of my time speaking at conferences, community meetups and doing
interviews with both mainstream and independent media. You can find a
collection of my videos here:

I'm also the CTO of Third Key Solutions that specializes in multi-signature
solutions for companies.
