I never said I want a faster block time, so please stop telling lies about me.  
  
I am so passionate about Bitcoin because I own so many of them, so I want to
see Bitcoin be the winner in the competition among cryptocurrencies.  
Having a congested network with high fees, slow confirmations, and easy double
spends is the formula to guarantee that Bitcoin loses to something else.
