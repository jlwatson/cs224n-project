When I placed my order, it gave me the option of Free Shipping for $0 and Flat
Shipping for $4.99. I went with the Free, but I was wondering what the
difference was. If Flat is faster, it may be good to state that there.  

  
I made it a little bit clearer.  
The text currently reads:  
  
 _ **Standard Shipping  
FREE for orders over $100  
  
  
Standard Shipping  
$4.99 for orders under $100**_
