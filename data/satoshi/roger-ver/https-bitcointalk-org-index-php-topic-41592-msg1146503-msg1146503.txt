There's more porn and offending material that is not censored.  
  
Is it possible to become a moderator for some of this stuff?  

  
This is needed.  
I often show the Bitmit site durring my presentation of Bitcoins to people in
Japan.  
It would be helpful if there was NOT porn on the front page.
