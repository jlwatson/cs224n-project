Even with freedom, there is still plenty of bad etiquette. You are just free
to have those bad manners.  
So far I don't find any of the posts in this thread rude though.  
  
A few things I do think people are overlooking:  
  
1\. This card will take a long time to pay off at the CURRENT exchange rate
and difficulty, but if bitcoins jump up in value again, you can have it paid
off much faster. (When I first started mining, I calculated that my gear would
take about 80 to 90 days to pay off. In reality it took about 35. This could
very well happen again, and I honestly expect it is likely as more and more
businesses begin using bitcoins)  
  
2\. If you buy one of these cards, not only do you get bitcoins while it is
mining, but you have one of the very best gaming cards on the market that you
can get entertainment from any time you want. If you only buy bitcoins, it is
harder to play a video game with them.  
  
Good luck with bitcoins and video games!
