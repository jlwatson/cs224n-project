USPS International shipping options are now available.  
  

  
I just got a quote for a $350 laptop  
  
Federal Express  
International Priority $350.90  
International Economy $356.02  
  
Those were the only options available  

  
Can you provide the country and postal code along with the part numbers you
were trying to order?  
I am not currently able to reproduce your issue.  
USPS currently shows as a shipping option.
