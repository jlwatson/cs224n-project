Challenge submitted.  

  
Your challenge is $9,800 short.

Other than that, I think it is a well reasoned response.  

  
Thanks. I'd be willing to make an actual $10,000 bet with you, but not one
where I lose the money either way.  

  
I would gladly agree to that, but betting where bettors keep the money
winnings is defined as gambling and is illegal throughout the United States.
This is one of many stupid laws that I am confident Bitcoin provides a
solution to, and one of many reasons why I think Bitcoin will become
incredibly popular in the nearï»¿ future.
