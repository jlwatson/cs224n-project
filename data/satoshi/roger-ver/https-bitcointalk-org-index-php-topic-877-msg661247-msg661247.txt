Hi,  
  
Would anyone here be interested in translating MultiBit into Japanese ?  
As Japan is the world's capital of QR codes I would like to offer it in
Japanese too.  
  
We have set it up on our translation website ( http://translate.multibit.org )
so it is all ready to go.  
  
It takes about an evening to translate the source text.  
Any help would be appreciated.  
Thanks,  
  
Jim  

I just did part of it.  
I will try to get the rest completed by someone soon.
