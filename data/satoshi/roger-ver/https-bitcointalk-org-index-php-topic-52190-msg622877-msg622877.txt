The full interview is now online at:  
  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZAFGRrp_kc  
  
It was heard live by around 100,000 people.  
  
I would not have had the knowledge to give this interview if it wasn't for all
the great users on this forum.  
Thank you all for your help!  
  
A good next step for everyone is to visit www.freetalklive.com, take a look at
their sponsors on the right hand side of the page, see if any of them have
something you want to buy, and contact them to see if they will accept
Bitcoins as payment.  
If they agree, please be sure to actually purchase the item from them. This is
a great way to get more shops to accept Bitcoin.

On Saturday Nov 19th 2011, at 7PM Eastern,  
I will be interviewed about Bitcoin on www.freetalklive.com  
  
It will air on more than 100 radio stations across the USA.  
Station list here: http://www.freetalklive.com/affiliates  
  
The show's audience is mainly libertarian, voluntarist, anti-war, free market
advocate types, so I will need to emphasize the aspects of bitcoin that will
appeal to them the most.  
  
My current list of talking points for this group is:  
  
 _1\. They allow anyone to have a "bank" account that CAN NOT be seized by the
IRS.  
2\. If you are careful, the IRS can't even know how much money you have in
your account, or that you even have an account at all!  
3\. They allow you to do business with whoever you want, anywhere in the
world, with complete privacy.  
4\. No one can block or seize your payments, in fact, you can even make your
payments secret from everyone else in the world.  
5\. If you set it up properly, no one can even track how much money you have
earned, so potentially, you could report as much, or as little of it as you
choose.  
6\. Bitcoins can not be counterfeited or inflated.  
7\. They will end the government's control of the money supply.  
  
In effect, they will make paying most taxes voluntary. (in fact, not
necessarily in law)  
If most taxes are voluntary, and the money supply can not be inflated, the
government won't be able to fund its wars. (and other stupid things)  
I suspect wars will be greatly reduced, if not eliminated if a Bitcoin like
currency becomes used world wide..  
  
  
The reasons it should be adopted by businesses are:  
  
1\. There are no 3rd party fees.  
2\. There are no chargebacks or fraudulent orders.  
3\. There is no risk of identity theft.  
4\. Payments can not be blocked or controlled.  
5\. It can be used world wide, with no need for currency exchange.  
6\. Anyone can accept Bitcoin payments in a matter of minutes.  
7\. As a business owner, I know how incredibly happy I would be if all my
customers paid with a form of money with the above properties.  
  
Neat things you can do with Bitcoins:  
  
Get a prepaid Mastercard that can be reloaded with Bitcoins any time through
OKPAY.COM  
Donate to Wikileaks.  
Play poker online for money despite the government's prohibition.  
Buy other prohibited items online. (Silkroad etc)_  
  
 **Please let me know what other things I should mention durring the
interview.  
What do you think I should say to catch people's attention?**  
  
Any input, thoughts, criticism, or other ideas are welcome.
