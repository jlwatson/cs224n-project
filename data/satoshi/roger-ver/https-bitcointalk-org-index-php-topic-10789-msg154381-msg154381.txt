I contacted the guy from Al Jazeera doing a story on BTC to see if there was
anything I could do to help him with the story.  
He said that he was looking for someone to do an in person interview in NYC.  
  
If there is anyone in that area willing to do this, please contact him at  
alessandro.rampietti@aljazeera.net

He mentioned doing it by skype, but sounded like he would prefer someone in
person.  
  
Lets put our best foot forward with this!
