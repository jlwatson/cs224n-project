about a month ago I paid for a netbook and password device for about 7.7
bitcoins. Not only was the item not sent to me but they say they cannot find
the order. I contacted bitpay however and they easily found my receipt.  
  
Here it is
https://bitpay.com/invoice?id=2H7PZhpAh0h9FHv__4opqwUa0xheP1xcfxhSsR01s2Y=  
  
and here is the blockchain transaction
fda4d7bd13e0153b1db3f3ea015ba6fed9fe3f8b209b55282fc79d9859f06470  
  
After I contacted them through email and they said they couldn't find my order
I emailed them March 20th and again March 29th with the bitpay information and
there has been no response  

  
What email address did you send the emails from? (Feel free to PM it to me)  
I'm happy to make sure this gets taken care of for you right away.  
We also have a phone number (1-888-586-6083) right on the bitcoinstore.com
website that you can call any time if you feel we are not responding quickly
enough.
