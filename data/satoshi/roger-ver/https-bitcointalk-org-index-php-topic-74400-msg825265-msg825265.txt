Trent,
Thank you so much for your past referrals.
From what I recall of your specific order, you were trying to buy Bitcoins
from me via credit card.
The card and information you were using set off just about every red flag
possible indicating credit card fraud.
I am not saying that I think you actually were trying to commit CC fraud, but
it didn't look safe enough from my end to justify the risk.
I don't think I even billed your CC, so I never even had your money.
Unfortunately we have had to reject between 1/3 to 1/2 of our Bitcoin orders
due to the high risk of fraud,
but I am glad to say after selling tens of thousands of dollars worth of
Bitcoins by CC and Paypal, I have not had a single fraudulent order slip
through.
If anyone else is ever unhappy with an order, they are welcome to contact me
about it directly at any time.
I will personally work to take care of any problem.
