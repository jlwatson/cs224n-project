To be clear, I'm in favor of Bitcoin scaling.  
I don't care if it is with bigger blocks, lighting network or something else,
as long as people maintain control over their own money.  
  
I love the Blockstream team and the projects they are working on too.  
  
I don't hate Theymos, I just disagree with his moderation policies, but
respect his right to do what he wants with his property.  
  
I'm involved with bitcoin because I want to separate money from the control of
governments.  
  
I would love to discuss these ideas with more of you on the forum that
actually allows dissenting opinion.
