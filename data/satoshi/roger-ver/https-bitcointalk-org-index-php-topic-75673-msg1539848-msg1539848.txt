I have dual passwords and two-factor login, but the iPhone app never asks for
any of these after the initial login. Anybody with access to my phone can rob
me clean  any fix to this?  

  
If you have dual encryption enabled, it will ask you for the second password
whenever you try to actually send Bitcoins from the wallet.
