I would also like to make it clear that I didn't make any of his Blockchain
account info public.  
I emailed him his own information.  
  
He then posted it on this forum himself. (Not me)  

  
And what about the threat about your family? Wasnt that MY **blockchain
SECRET** key?  

  
I didn't tell anyone that it was your blockchain secret, I simply said that
you sent me a threat.
