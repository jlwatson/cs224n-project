The supplier I use for general computer gear is www.malabs.com but they don't
sell direct to end users.  
  
They carry just about all the same stuff as newegg, and I can get it a few
dollars cheaper than new egg for most items, so I can still earn a few
bitcoins too.  
I can ship just about every order the same day, or we can arrange a local
pickup at my office.  
  
Please let me know if there is anything else you would like.
