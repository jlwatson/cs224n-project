Hi everyone,  
  
I'm Gary Le, co-founder of Moneta, which is the world's first implementation
of Zerocoin ( http://moneta.cash ).  
  
The Zerocoin Protocol is a cryptographic protocol that add an additional layer
of privacy on top of the Bitcoin protocol. It uses "Zero-Knowledge Proofs" to
guarantee that transactions are completely anonymous and private.  
  
If you are interested in participating in our testnet, stay tuned as we hope
to open up the testnet soon.  
  
I look forward to your questions 8-)  
  
Gary
