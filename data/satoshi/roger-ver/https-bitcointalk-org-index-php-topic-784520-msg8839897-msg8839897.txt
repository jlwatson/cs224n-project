BitcoinBountyHunter.com is now live.  
  
Now anyone can contribute bitcoins to motivate people with information on
criminals to provide that information to law enforcement, or motivate law
enforcement officers to take action directly.  
I've personally contributed over 40 BTC for the bounties to help get things
started.  
With this financial motivation I hope we can help catch the dishonest among
us, and motivate those working in law enforcement to actually take action.  
  
I'm sure there is lots of room for improvement to the site's aesthetic and
technical implementation.  
  
Please post your suggestions for improvements to the site below.  
  
Together we are making a better world!
