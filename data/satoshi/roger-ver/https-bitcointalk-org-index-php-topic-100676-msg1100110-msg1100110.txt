I'm working on some interesting things in Japan.  
More Bitcoin stuff will start happening here soon.  
  
Later this month, I will be giving a much bigger presentation on Bitcoins in
Akihabara (The electronics district in Tokyo)  
I will try to have it video taped and put on youtube.  
  
I think the biggest holdup currently, is that there are no Japanese language
wallets yet.
