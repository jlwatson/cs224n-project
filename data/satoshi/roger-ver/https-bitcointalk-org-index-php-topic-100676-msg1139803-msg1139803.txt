  
I can't currently go into all the details, but my math and screen shots are
correct.  
The screenshot only shows 10% of each deposit. $100 x 10 = $1000 (~100000 yen)
minimum deposit.  
  
If you don't want to believe me that is fine, but I think my past bitcoin
reputation speaks for itself.  
  
Feel free to google (Roger Ver Bitcoin) and you will find plenty of
background.
