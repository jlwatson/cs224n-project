I think you should change the title of your thread from " bitcoin client is
eating my bitcoins, WTF?" to bitcoin client is not confirming my transactions,
WTF?  
  
I came to the forums and saw this thread title, and instantly had a horrible
fear that there was a major bug with the client.  
  
If you like bitcoins, there is no reason to cause unneeded alarm with
sensational message subjects that are not accurate.
