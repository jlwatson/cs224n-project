Good idea.. but some people (e.g me) are quite particular about which
charities they'll support.  
.......  
Is it too early to try to convince individual charities to accept it directly?  

  
I agree, so we tried to chose the least controversial charity possible.  
If anyone can suggest a less controversial one, but equally well known, now is
the time.  
  
I think asking EVERY charity and business that you intend to pay to accept
bitcoins is a great idea TODAY!  
  
That brings me to my next idea that I will post about tomorrow.
