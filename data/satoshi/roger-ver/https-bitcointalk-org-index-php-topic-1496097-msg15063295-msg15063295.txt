  
Greg, you should really be ashamed of yourself for attacking fellow members of
this community who care so deeply about Bitcoin.  
  
I nearly singlehandedly funded the entire first wave of Bitcoin adoption with
well over a million dollars worth of money that I earned before I'd even heard
of Bitcoin.  
Since then I've spent 6.5 years of my life and about $20M USD worth of my own
bitcoin promoting the ecosystem, including billboards and national radio ads.  
I created the first website to accept Bitcoin for hundreds of thousands of
products, kicking off the entire wave of Bitcoin merchant adoption around the
world. I also funded the seed rounds for most of the popular Bitcoin
businesses today.  
  
I thank you for your work on the core Bitcoin protocol, but you are a true
black belt level troll.
