He owns 100,000+ BTC,  

Oft, claimed, never proved\-- I bet him and Wright are great buddies. Maybe it
was true at one point, but one doesn't retaining 100,000 BTC by buying loads
of ripple, ethereum, and every other highly hyped altcoin that comes around.  
  
If it is true, it's remarkable and sad-- to own so much bitcoin and yet spend
none of it to help further the development of Bitcoin... and instead just
investing in putting a sleazy looking gambling site on Bitcoin.com (and
filling the site with pro ethereum news).  
  
  
  

  
Greg, you should really be ashamed of yourself for attacking fellow members of
this community who care so deeply about Bitcoin.  
  
I nearly singlehandedly funded the entire first wave of Bitcoin adoption with
well over a million dollars worth of money that I earned before I'd even heard
of Bitcoin.  
Since then I've spent 6.5 years of my life and about $20M USD worth of my own
bitcoin promoting the ecosystem, including billboards and national radio ads.  
I created the first website to accept Bitcoin for hundreds of thousands of
products, kicking off the entire wave of Bitcoin merchant adoption around the
world. I also funded the seed rounds for most of the popular Bitcoin
businesses today.  
  
I thank you for your work on the core Bitcoin protocol, but you are a true
black belt level troll.
