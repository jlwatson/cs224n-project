I'm currently seeing a 17%+ excess cost due to BTC exchange rates.  
  
Is this normal?  
The price seems to be using around $20.5 instead of somewhere near $24  

  
The current site will give you the correct price at checkout.  
The new site will display everything in real time so there isn't any more
confusion.  
  
Here is a screen shot of the new site that will be pushed to the live server
soon:  
  
  
  
The MTGOX price is the most recent trade.  
The Bitcoinstore price is the highest bid on MTGOX.
