Just wondering how this is going overall and whether you're on target to meet
the turnover you mentioned you needed to remain viable. This is one of the
biggest experiments out there and it would be interesting to know how it's
faring.  

  
Things are moving MUCH slower than required.  
I need to hire an experienced project manager.  
If someone is interested, please contact me.
