So much FUD in one post!  
Have you seen my tax returns? I spent close to $1M USD just on lawyers and tax
accountants alone to help me file everything exactly perfectly.  
I've paid the IRS millions upon millions of dollars and I've never had a "tax
problem" with the IRS ever, despite having been audited numerous times.  
  
My crime was "Dealing in Explosives **WITHOUT A LICENSE** ". I sold store
bought fire crackers on ebay, and my crime was doing it without the right
government paperwork. It was a politically motivated prosecution. Even while I
was in prison, the company I bought the fireworks from, and the manufacturer
were still selling them without a license. Details here.  
  
  
Maybe it is because Japan is a freer country than the USA, and every
convenience store in the country sells fireworks in the summer time. Try
finding that in the land of the free.  
  
I've arguably done more to help the legal side of Bitcoin adoption than anyone
else in the world. Go and read this book for the details. Calling my thoughts
"libertarian rambles" doesn't make them any less true. Taxation is theft. The
draft is kidnapping and slavery. War is mass murder funded by theft. I refuse
to condone any of those things.
