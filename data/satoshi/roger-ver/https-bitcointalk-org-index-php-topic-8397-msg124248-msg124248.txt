I sent an email, but you didnt answer.  
  
I want to buy this hd5850, N82E16814102932 and ship it to Santiago, Chile.  
Fedex says that Chile is a zone L country, and they charge about 90 usd for
2lb of cargo.  
  
So, how much would be the deal? And do you use clearcoin?  
  
  

  
GA-583UD1G GIGABYTE ATI Radeon HD5830 1GB DDR5 2DVI/HDMI/DisplayPort PCI-
Express Video Card $249 each  
  
I have never used clearcoin before, but I am open to the idea.
