Stop and think for a moment.  
If I own a large number of Bitcoins, and Bitcoin.com, that means I'm
financially motivated to do everything I can to improve the value of those
assets.  
This is unlike Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, who by his own admission,
and despite having known about Bitcoin for about 5 years due to being
contacted by Satoshi himself in 2008, he didn't own a single Bitcoin himself
in April of 2013. I doubt he has many bitcoins now either.  
  
Compare that with someone like myself who spent nearly every penny I had
buying Bitcoin as soon as I learned about them in 2011.  
Adam Back can run circles around me when it comes to the underlying
mathematics of Bitcoin, but he has demonstrated by his own actions that he has
absolutely no clue why Bitcoin came to be used as money, and to this day he
still doesn't understand why Bitcoin is money. Sadly, his firm has done an
incredible amount of harm to Bitcoin's adoption rate and has caused Bitcoin's
market share to plummet from around 90% to less than 50% today.  
  
Bitcoin is the only coin in the world to ever have had full blocks.  
If we want to experiment with the effects of full blocks on a system, it is
incredibly reckless to do it on Bitcoin, yet that is exactly what Adam and his
ilk have done. If we want to experiment with full blocks, do it on an alt
coin!
