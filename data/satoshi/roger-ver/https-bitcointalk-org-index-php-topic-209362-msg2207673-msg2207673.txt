This is an outright lie.
I never received any of my bitcoins back from Bitcoinica.
(Zhou refunded about 1000)
I repeatedly asked for 50% because most other Bitcoinica customers had already
received that much back.

Today:
I still am owed 24,841 BTC.
Tihan will answer my call on the phone any time, and he will gladly discuss
any of this.
Patrick Strateman has blocked me on skype, and wont take my calls.
Amir seems to have good intentions, but way out of touch with reality, causing
him to do more harm than good.
Donald has remained silent, and seems to want to let everyone else deal with
this.
Zhou hasn't had any additional contact with myself, but he needs to provide
the identity of the "relic hunter" ASAP. (I doubt this person exists)

The thread starter is obviously using a pupet account, and I strongly suspect
it is controlled by one of the intersango trio.
Most likely Patrick Strateman. (I have no proof of this, but is sure seems
likely to me)


*****EDIT******  
If the Bitcoinica Trio had accepted the buyout offer, every single Bitcoinica
customer would have received %100 of their money back except:
Myself, Jesse Powell, Brian Cartmell, and Jed McCaleb

Mtgox is willing to release the remaining funds to the liquidator as soon as
they prove ownership of the accounts.
MTGOX simply needs to know the account names, and passwords to turn over the
funds to the liquidators.
Patrick Strateman is refusing to provide this information to MTGOX / The
liquidators.
