Dennis previously invited me to have a video interview on scaling Bitcoin with him.  He didn't like the way I demolished his small block position in the interview, so then he refused to release the video of it, and now he is implying that I'm a fraud.  Send me the video Dennis and I will gladly publish it on my own YouTube Channel.
