I think it is also important to note that the Blockchain.info code is open
source:  
  
https://github.com/blockchain  
  
  
I think Blockchain is superior to Coinbase because if Blockchain.info were to
be hacked, only a small number of users who actively logged in while the
server was compromised would lose their coins.  
  
  
If Coinbase is hacked, all their online funds could be stolen. (I learned this
the hard way with Bitcoinica)  
There is also nothing stopping a court order from seizing their cold storage
backups from the safety deposit box at the bank.  
  
  
With Blockchain, those are not issues.
