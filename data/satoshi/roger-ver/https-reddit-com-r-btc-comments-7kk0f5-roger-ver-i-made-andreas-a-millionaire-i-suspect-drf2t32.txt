Great job taking my quote out of context and twisting the meaning of my words.  
* 1 [Full Context](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7kf43b/bitcoincom_wallet_2_out_of_5_stars_531_ratings_we/dre11sk/)  I was replying to someone accusing me of attacking Andreas' lively hood.  I've never attacked his lively hood and was responsible for giving him his first BTC paying job. 

* 2 I've never attacked Andreas,  I said he is one of the best public speakers the entire ecosystem has.  If he had invested a few hundred dollars of his own money,  he would have already been a millionaire today.  That isn't an attack,  it is just a simple truth.
