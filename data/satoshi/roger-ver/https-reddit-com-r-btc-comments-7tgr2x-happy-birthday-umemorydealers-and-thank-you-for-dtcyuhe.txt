Only ones who have stolen from me.  I believe reputational enforcement  via public shaming is a great way to achieve justice compared with legacy legal systems,  If I had wasted my time suing this person for my money back it would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and taken years. Instead it was resolved in about 48 hours and no government involvement was needed.
