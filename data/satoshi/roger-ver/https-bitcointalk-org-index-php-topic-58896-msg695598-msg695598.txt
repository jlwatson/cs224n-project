  
Thank you guys for the kind words, but I don't want or need any kind of
special help.  
The more electronics businesses that accept Bitcoin, the better.  
  
I personally know memoryx.net's owner is interested in Bitcoins.  
MemoryX is a much bigger company than MemoryDealers, and they carry a product
line that the general public will be much more interested in.  
If they have something that you actually want to buy, feel free to contact
them and let them know that you would like to buy it with Bitcoin.
