I have been telling many people in mainland China about Bitcoins, some of them
seem very interested.  
Can someone explain for me how easy/difficult it will be for the great
firewall of China to be able to stop the spread of bitcoins?  
  
Is it possible that a non technical person inside of China will have trouble
sending and receiving bitcoins with someone outside of China?
