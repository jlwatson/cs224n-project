Why can't I see any mention of Alipay for deposits or withdrawals in my
Bitcoinica account?  
  
For deposits I see the following options:  
  
1\. Bitcoin  
2\. Deposit by Bitcoinica Code (Instant)  
3\. Deposit by BitInstant (Instant)  
4\. Deposit by Mt. Gox Code (Instant)  
5\. Deposit by AurumXchange  
6\. Deposit by International Wire Transfer  
  
For withdrawals I see the following options:  
  
1\. Bitcoinica Code  
2\. BitInstant  
3\. Mt. Gox Code (USD)  
4\. Mt. Gox Code (BTC)  
5\. Bitcoin  
6\. International Wire Transfer  
  
  
No where is there a mention of Alipay.  
  
Please advise.
