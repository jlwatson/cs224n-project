My friends already translated the weusecoins video into Korean and Japanese.  
The subtitles are here:http://www.weusecoins.com/materials.php  
  
Can someone convert the video with the subtitles into a file and upload it to
youtube?  
I think it would be useful to have the video on youtube with the subtitles
hard coded in.
