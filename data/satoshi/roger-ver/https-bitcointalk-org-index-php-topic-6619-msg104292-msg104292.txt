I'm tired of waiting, (and tired from my normal job)  
I will donate my normal radio ads each day to bitcoin.  
  
Can anyone help write up a template for what the radio hosts should say?  
The time frame I have is 30 seconds, and I am sure the radio audience is the
type of person who would already be interested in bitcoins.  
They have been mentioning them nearly every day recently.  
  
The radio show is on 95 Radio stations nationally plus XM Satelite radio.

Please write what you think the radio hosts should say in 30 seconds, and I
will have the adds started this week.  
  
Lets make bitcoin mainstream ASAP!
