I've just asked them to start the following ad:  
  
  
 **Are you tired of watching the value of the dollar plummet?  
Are you tired of banks charging you fees?  
Do you want to take back control of your own money?  
Then take a look at Bitcoin!  
Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized, anonymous internet currency, and
is gaining popularity every day.  
It's free to use, free to accept, and free from inflation---forever!  
You can use bitcoins anywhere in the world, and their value will only grow
with time.  
To learn more, visit weusecoins.org. ThatÂ’s weusecoins.org**  
  
We can still change it at any time in the future.  
We also need to come up with a 30 second recorded ad.  
  
I will post the audio of the first ad once it runs.
