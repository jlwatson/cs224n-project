Are you still doing the NewEgg thing for bitcoin? I'll be in the market for
some new gear in the not-to-distant future. Contrary to the deflation/hoarding
stuff we hear around here all the time, seems to me people are doing more
bitcoin-for-goods-and-services transactions around here than ever.  

  
I would be happy to.
