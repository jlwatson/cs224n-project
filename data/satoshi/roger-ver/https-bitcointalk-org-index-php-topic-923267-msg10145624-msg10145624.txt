For those who are wondering, I "invested" in Ripple, before even the creators
knew what it was going to be.  
Jed had an amazing track record, and back in early 2012 he asked for some
money to try to create something new and Bitcoin related. Thus, my investment
in Ripple was born. I don't really see it as a competitor to Bitcoin, and I
suspect there are at least 1,000 if not 10,000 developers working on Bitcoin
projects for every 1 developer working on Ripple stuff.
