  
Any international VAT taxes will be charged by the shipping company to the
customer.  
Bitcoinstore.com must report the true customs value on each shipment, but I
wouldn't lose any sleep if someone from the deep web started offering to
reship our products internationally and under declare the customs value.  
There is likely a lot of money to be made with this business model.
