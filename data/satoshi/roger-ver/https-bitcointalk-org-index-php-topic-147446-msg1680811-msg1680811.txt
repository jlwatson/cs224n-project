Question to Bitcoinstore:  
  
International orders, do they include US VAT/sales tax ? This is normally in
the range 5-10% ? There wasn't any mention of it in my order, so I wonder if
this is usually paid by the customer, or deducted for international orders?  

  
Any international VAT taxes will be charged by the shipping company to the
customer.  
Bitcoinstore.com must report the true customs value on each shipment, but I
wouldn't lose any sleep if someone from the deep web started offering to
reship our products internationally and under declare the customs value.  
There is likely a lot of money to be made with this business model.
