OK, that's a quick start. We now know that "bit-pay" is operating out of an
house, who's behind it, and some other things they're doing. So if they "lose"
any funds, it's clear where to send lawyers and cops.

They do not hold your earnings, you receive those into your wallet every day.
So worst case scenario is they steal one transaction and the company packs up
and moves to Singapore. All for your 5 BTC.  

  
I expect to see contractual statements like "all payments made after NNN will
be transmitted to ACH by NNN".  

  
They have all of those covered on their website.  
  
https://bit-pay.com/legal.html  

  
No, they do not. They have an "acceptable use policy", plagiarized from
PayPal's acceptable use policy, and a "privacy policy", plagiarized from
PayPal's privacy policy). They do **not** have any terms which contractually
bind "bit-pay" with regard to financial transactions.  
  
This is important. Potential merchants need to know about transaction
reversals, chargebacks, payout limitations, delays in payment, separation of
customer funds from company funds, and dispute resolution procedures. All of
those areas have created major problems for users of other Bitcoin-related
services.  
  
This is two guys with no financial experience operating out of a house in
Florida. The odds are that they will screw up. Merchants need legal protection
for when they do.  

  
you know, you should just STFU. we all know you're a paid shill basher of
bitcoin. otherwise, you wouldn't be spending so much time here and you
would've taken my bet of 100 BTC to you. when bitcoin skyrockedts again,
you're gonna lose your job.  

  
Nagle, I would love to hear your reply to cypherdoc's accusations. From the
posts I have read from both of you, it would seem that cypherdoc's assessment
is correct.
