no worries. I wasn't sure who was taking the cut when discounts were offered.
I'll hold off on pushing bitcoinstore until a week or two from now, b/c I
think the everyday low prices will be much more appealing after the craziness
of the next few days is past us.  

  
Within a week or two the $1,000 limit will be removed and the site will be
much more user friendly in general.
