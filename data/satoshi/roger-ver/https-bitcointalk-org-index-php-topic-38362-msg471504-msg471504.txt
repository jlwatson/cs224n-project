Two of the announcements I am most excited about are the launch of  
http://www.bitcoindeals.com/  
  
and that the Bitcoin ATM machines will be live in a little over a week!  
  
The conference has been amazing so far, and I have met so many people who I
feel have instantly become friends for life.  
It is such a wonderful feeling to be around so many other people who "get"
Bitcoin.  
  
www.BTCinch.com also seems to be a wonderful merchant solution site.  
It is free to accept bitcoins, and for a small fee they will automatically
convert a percentage of the merchant's choosing into USD.  
They also have a system to send out bitcoins by email to email lists.  
So far they have had more than 50% of their sent bitcoins claimed within 3
hours!  
If you want to start a mass bitcoin email marketing campaign for your
business, contact BTCINCH.com!!
