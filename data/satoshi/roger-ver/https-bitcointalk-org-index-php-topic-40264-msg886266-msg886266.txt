I'm having major trouble signing up more than one person at a time for your
wallet in China.  
When installing your wallet, people are constantly getting an error that says
that a wallet was recently created from the same IP address, so it blocks them
from creating a new wallet.  
  
Please fix this ASAP!  
  
Tomorrow night I am having a substantial business meeting with a large number
of Business owners in the Shenzhen area.

I want everything to go smoothly with your wallet!
