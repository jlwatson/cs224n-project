  
I'm not the organizer, and I don't know the details of how the meetings are
advertised.  
  
There are several Japanese guys that organize investment/business clubs or
organizations of some sort.  
They are organizing everything and just have me helping explain Bitcoin.  
I think their primary interest is making money through investing, and after
hearing about Bitcoin, they see the potential.  
I'm careful to explain that in several years, one bitcoin will likely be worth
a lot of money or nothing at all, and almost certainly not what they are worth
today.  
I think we may see some Japanese businesses starting to use Bitcoin by 2013.
