I guess people should make a new address, but there might be circumstances
where they don't want to or can't do that. For example a July fundraiser by a
site that wants to use the same address as always for transparency. Maybe have
a checkbox for "disregard previous payments to this address"?  

  
Great idea!  
I will check with the programmers to see about implementing this.
