Maybe more of us should approach http://www.manventureoutpost.com/ about this.  
  
This company is a sponsor of freetalklive.com and has already heard of
Bitcoins.  
  
I approached the owner about accepting Bitcoins a few months ago and he was
cool towards the idea.  
  
If more people that actually want to buy things for Bitcoins contact him, he
might warm to the idea.  
  
Nothing bad can come from asking, so give it a try!
