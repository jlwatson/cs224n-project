What if you were planning to sell your BCH tomorrow,  but you heard insider information that Coinbase was going to list it the following day,  so you decide NOT to sell your BCH as you were planning to before you heard the information.  Would not selling your BCH in this case also be immoral insider trading too? Why, or why not?
