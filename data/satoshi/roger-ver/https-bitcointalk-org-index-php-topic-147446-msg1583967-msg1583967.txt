Do we know when search will improved? Last week I was able to search "wireless
headset" and get about 30 results, all reasonable. Today when I search it
comes up with 1500+ items and most neither wireless nor headset.  

  
Several people are working on it full time.  
There will be lots more improvements to the website soon.  
An improved search is near the top of the list.  
Thank you for your support!
