Here is what the main guy (Brian) who is working on this said:  
 _I've now got the bitcoin settings in the admin pages so it can be turned on
and off, and I have a test product in the store. Next is adding the code to
talk to the local bitcoind. That code exists already at bitcoin.org. I'm too
busy to make that priority #1 but its moving along.  
  
This weekend I am doing speeches at 2 different events around the Bay Area
about bitcoin! That's why I'm busy now. One of them is going to be tough and
technical, for the Bay Area Hackers Association in SF. They want technology
and crypto talk. The other is at a floating anarchist festival out on the
delta near Stockton. They will pick me up in a speedboat and drive me out to
the event! That one is Saturday at noon I think. So I am busy preparing two
different speeches.  
  
Bitcoin hit $32!  
  
Crazy!

I'm not sure what his ID is on the forums here, but I imagine he would love
some help!
