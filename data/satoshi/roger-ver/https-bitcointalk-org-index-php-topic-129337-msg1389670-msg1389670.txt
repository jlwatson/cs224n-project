Taaki or you and alikes? I choose Taaki.  

  
Plain as day, Taaki is a thief. (He stole the Bitcoinica source code, and
published what wasn't his to publish)  

  
Quote to quote.  

  
Here is another quote for you:  
  
Patrick Strateman (Phantomcircut) is a liar, and has implied physical threats
of violence against myself.  
  
That's not the appropriate way to conduct business.  
  
BTW, when will you be giving me back my 23,291.7726294 Bitcoins? (Currently
worth about $300K USD)  
I didn't even get a single Bitcoin back from you.
