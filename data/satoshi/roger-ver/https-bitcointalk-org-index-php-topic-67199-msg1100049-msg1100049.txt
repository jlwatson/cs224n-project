For me tbh, I could care less about people like Roger Ver who have a lot of
money lost because they have lots more.  

  
Amir, I look forward to karma coming back to get you.  
Believe it or not, losing 24,000 BTC because of an idiot like you, HAS HAD A
BIG BIG IMPACT ON MY LIFE!  
People with attitudes like yours give a bad reputation to our entire movement.  
  
Do the world a favor and quit your involvement with Bitcoin.  
  
Sincerely,  
Roger Ver
