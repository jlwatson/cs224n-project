The point is, blockchain is a site you back which supports anonymity. By
posting his info and declaring yourself part owner you were simultaneously
pointing out that you have access to records that can track people, and
showing that you can access them at any time for someone requesting them such
as the authorities. Nethead wont do the right thing, he has 9 posts assuming
its not just a puppet, just scam tag him and move on, dont wreck your
reputation for 50 dollars.  

  
All the information I posted here came from Bitcoinstore.  
None of it came from Blockchain.info (until after the scammer posted it
himself)
