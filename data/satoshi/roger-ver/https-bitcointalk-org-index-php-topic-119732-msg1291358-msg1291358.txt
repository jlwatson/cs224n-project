This conference is a huge success.  
I can't count how many VC company execs and decision makers at various payment
companies I spoke with today.  
I set up more blockchain.info mobile wallets than I can count, and gave each
person 0.01 BTC to get them started seeing how easy it was to use.  
Everyone was super interested and were brainstorming ideas on how they can use
Bitcoin in their current business model.  
  
I am sure lots of new products will come into existence thanks to this
conference.
