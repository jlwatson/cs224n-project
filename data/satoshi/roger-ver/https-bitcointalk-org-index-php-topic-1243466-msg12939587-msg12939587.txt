Quote from: Andrew Lee

I am a payments geek and a FinTech entrepreneur. When I first learned about
Bitcoin in 2011, I thought it was interesting so I bought some and promptly
forgot about it. My first company was a credit card processor that was
acquired by Sage Payments. I joined Bank of America Merrill Lynch in 2012 to
cover emerging payments, and our group evaluated many new payments
technologies including Apple Pay.  
  
In 2014, Kent and I started Purse out of a coffee shop in SF. We didnt
initially set out to create a company. We shared a common frustration that
Bitcoin didnt offer any incentive for normal people to use it, and we had a
hunch that we could use blockchain escrows to liquidate Amazon gift cards and
deliver great deals. Our hunch proved to be correct - we transacted over $4.5M
and saved users almost a million dollars.  
  
Today, Im excited to announce the expansion our marketplace with Purse
Merchants! Businesses will be able to sell directly on Purse, the worlds
largest consumer marketplace for Bitcoin. Trezor, Ledger, KangerTech, among
others, will go live on our site this week.
