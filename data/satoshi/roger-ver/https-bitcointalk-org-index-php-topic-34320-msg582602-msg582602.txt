With bitcoins, a person in California can send $20,000 USD worth of value to a
person in Russia in a matter of seconds, for FREE.  
  
In comparison:  
Paypal would cost about $600, and take a few seconds.  
Credit card would cost about $600 and take a few days, to a week, or more.  
Bank wire would cost about $40, and take one or two days.  

  
This is a joke right? The price now is $2.4. Somebody sends $20,000 USD worth
to somebody else. That's 8,333.33BTCs. The recipient wants to cash out
immediately to pay for something. Remember, we're comparing this to services
like Paypal, bank wires, etc, where in the end the recipient has cash that
they can spend anywhere. So, the recipient sells their 8,333.33BTCs on MtGox
and, uh oh, at the current depth they get $18,800 (not including MtGox fees!).  
  
To get the same result that they would get from PP (i.e. an end result of cash
they can spend anywhere) ends up costing at least twice as much! Isn't it
wonderful.  

  
This is why i cant take OP seriously. Either hes extremely dumb or he has his
own agenda.  
  

  
At the time I made the original post, there was plenty of depth to accommodate
buying or selling $20,000 worth of bitcoins, and hardly move the price at all.
Today that is not the case, but give it some time.....  
  
I'm not "extremely dumb" but I do have my own agenda.  
It is promoting the free market and the accompanying voluntary society.
