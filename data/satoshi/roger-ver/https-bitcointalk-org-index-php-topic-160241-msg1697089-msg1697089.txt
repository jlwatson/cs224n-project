What is your order number?  
Did you know we have a phone number listed right on our website
www.bitcoinstore.com so people who have issues can call to find out the
status?  
1 (888) 586-6083  
Give us a call, or email me at roger at bitcoinstore.com and I will get things
taken care of for you.  

  
Thanks for the feedback. I have sent multiple messages on the contact us form,
asking for emails back but got nothing. I didn't see the phone and email
address at the bottom of the page. I'll shoot you an email now and report
back.  
  
To be clear, I really want bitcoinstore to succeed, that's why I placed an
order early, and was planning on making a big ticket purchase upon successful
fulfillment. I've only heard good things so far.  
  
  

  
On Average it takes about 2 or 3 days for a customer to receive their order.
(Sometimes it is the very next day)  
If you haven't gotten yours after 2 or 3 weeks, there is definitely a problem
with your order.  
  
I look forward to taking care of this for you.
