We have been in discussions with Bruce and although we can't be there
personally, we will be providing a mobile web app for the conference (iOS and
Android compatible) that will allow those unable to attend the ability to get
key info and video (not live at this point.) For those attending it will also
have the full current schedule of events that will be updated as things
change. In addition, it will have a vendor directory, speaker list, and
twitter feed. (I recommend we use #BitCon hashtag)  
  
We plan on keeping the app live indefinitely after the event so those who are
completely unavailable during the event can catch up on it after the fact.  

  
When can I download this, and what should I search for in the app store?
