Im having trouble using the fedex calculator, Im getting $120 estimates to
ship a electrical machinary part that weighs 8lbs  

  
That sounds like a bit much,  
I am happy to ship by UPS as well.  
Maybe their website will be easier.  
I am also working on getting everything automated online ASAP.
