I'm happy to help pay to make this all happen.  
My intention is to release the module for free to anyone who wants to use it
once it is ready.  
The more real merchants that accept bitcoin directly, the better.  
  
Also, if the module is open source, I think more people would be willing to
trust it.  
  
I have ZERO programming skills, so I need help from people like you.  
Just let me know what I can do to help!
