I agreed to loan him dollars because I felt sorry for him. We both knew the Bitcoin would end up being worth much much more.  Even though I had lost 100% of $120K I had invested in Bitinstant, I considered the $5K more of a gift. For what seemed to be pride he insisted that he wanted to pay it back, so he even created a formal legal contract for it.  If he hadn't started intentionally damaging Bitcoin's future,  I doubt I would have ever asked him for the money back at all.  After re-reading the contract,  it looks like he owes me the amount of Bitcoin from the time I first asked for the money.  I'll have to calculate it later,  but an additional $5K or so...
