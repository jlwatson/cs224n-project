So far this convention has been a HUGE success!  
I have so many amazing conversations with so many amazing people.  
After seeing first hand how many intelligent people are this excited and
interested in Bitcoins, I am even more sure that we are changing the world.  
  
BTW,  
Bitcoin ATM guy (Todd Bethell) is here and had a booth.  
I've enjoyed some interesting conversations with him, and he is a very sharp
guy as well.  
  
His first ATM machines will be live in public locations in about a week.  
If you know someone who has a location that can host a Bitcoin ATM, please
contact him!
