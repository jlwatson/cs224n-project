this domain is indeed pointed at the official bitcoin website. it doesn't make
much difference as everyone knows the official site has a .org extention.  

  
That is true for all of us, but new people don't know.  
Bitcoin.com gets tens of thousands of unique visitors each month from people
who don't know anything yet, so they go to Bitcoin.com because they figure
that must be the official website for the official Bitcoin company.
