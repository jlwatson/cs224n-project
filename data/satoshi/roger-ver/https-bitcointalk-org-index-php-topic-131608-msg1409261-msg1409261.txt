I just wanted to mention that a skilled blockchain.info admin can perfectly
steal your funds. He just needs to change the javascript sent to your browser
in order to get your password.  
  

  
This is not true.  
  
See here: https://blockchain.info/wallet/verifier  
  
It should also be noted that ThomasV runs a competitor to Blockchain.info
