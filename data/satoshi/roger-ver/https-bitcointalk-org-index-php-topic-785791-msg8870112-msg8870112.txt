It is ambiguous: Satoshi & Roger Ver Hacker actually means Satoshi OR Roger or
Satoshi AND Roger?  

  
It is pretty clear that the hacker is the same person for both instances. They
are using the same names, and profile images.  
  
The part that really really has me mad at this person, is that they claim to
have swatted quadriplegic Hal Finney recently.  
  
If true, that should make everyone's blood boil.

8:44:56 PM Savaged: Lol  
8:45:06 PM Documents@Jabb3r.org: You did?  
8:45:09 PM Savaged: Like I said before, he didn't realize I was joking about
"backing down"  
8:45:26 PM Savaged: I attacked his disabled family  
8:45:52 PM Savaged: Which wouldn't of needed to happen if he just did what I
told him to do  
8:47:00 PM Savaged: You know who Hal Finney is?  
8:47:16 PM Documents@Jabb3r.org: Yes.  
8:47:23 PM Savaged: Do you like him?  
8:48:00 PM Documents@Jabb3r.org: Why?

8:48:38 PM Savaged: After that happened Ver gave up his coins  
8:49:25 PM Savaged: I don't even know who you are so I don't know why I'm
telling you shit, I'll stop now  
8:49:30 PM Savaged: Until I know who you are  

  
For the record, I never paid Savaged anything.
