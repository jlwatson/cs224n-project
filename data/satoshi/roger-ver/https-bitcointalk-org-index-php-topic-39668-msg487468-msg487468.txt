  
Electricity is included in the rent, but there is a clause to bill the tenant
for "excessive" use. I think mining would fall within that clause.  
  
I would be happy to list the rent in Bitcoins, but the exchange rate changes
to quickly, so for now the rent is listed in USD, but can be paid in BTC at
the current rate.
