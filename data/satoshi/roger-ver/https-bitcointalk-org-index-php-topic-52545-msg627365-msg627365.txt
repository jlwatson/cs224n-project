I don't think any of what I am purposing would alienate your existing user
base.  
You can continue to sell them bitcents to use on your auctions with paypal or
CC just like you do now.  
It would however make it MUCH more worth while for sellers to sell on your
site.  
  
As someone who is considering listing all sorts of high end electronics on
your site,  
I can tell you that I would be MUCH more inclined to do this if I were to be
paid in Bitcents directly without having to  
spend time finding someone to trade credits for Bitcoins with.  
I understand that it is possible in theory to do the exchange, but it is an
extra step with no benefit.  
  
Everyone would be served better by using bitcents directly.
