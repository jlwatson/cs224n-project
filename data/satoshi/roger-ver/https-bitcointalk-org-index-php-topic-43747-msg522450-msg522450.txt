(Please post this video on your facebook so all your friends and family will
now know there is an easy way for them to buy Bitcoins!)  
  
It will be read live, on air by the radio host.  
  
A list of the stations and times can be found here:

I would appreciate your feedback on anything that you think should be changed
or added.  
  
I would also like suggestions for other Bitcoin related ads that should be
done.  
(I'm trying to think of one about how MTGOX is better and cheaper than paypal)
