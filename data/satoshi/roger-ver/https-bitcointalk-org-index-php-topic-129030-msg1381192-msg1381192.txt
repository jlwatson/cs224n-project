Here is another great submission from: Timbo925  
  
He says:  
  
 _Hi,  
Here is my design for the Antiwar.com design site.  
All is made in vector format so you have maximum flexibility.  
If you want to contact me you can use this email or find me on bitcointalk
(Timbo925).  
Used a totally different color scheme to the old site so I hope this isn't a
problem.  
If you pick this as the winning design I can always change color/position ...
till you think its perfect.  
  
Hope you like it!  
Kind Regards,_
