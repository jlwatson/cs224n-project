To the people linking to this quote from elsewhere, go back look at the [Full Context](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7kf43b/bitcoincom_wallet_2_out_of_5_stars_531_ratings_we/dre11sk/).  I was replying to someone accusing me of attacking Andreas' lively hood.  I've never attacked his lively hood and was responsible for giving him his first BTC paying job. 

In fact, I've never attacked Andreas at all,  I said he is one of the best public speakers the entire ecosystem has.  If he had invested a few hundred dollars of his own money,  he would have already been a millionaire today.  That isn't an attack,  it is just a simple truth.
