Quote from: Luis

I am an entrepreneur. I started my career 20 years ago building banking
systems. 16 months ago I founded Fermat : A peer to peer Financial Application
Framework. We have been in stealth mode until just now, so it is quite logical

Fermat in a nutshell is a P2P Network for transporting meta-data and a Plug-

currency and digital assets enabled. The goal is to decentralize the full
stack up until the GUI in order to enable an ecosystem of financial
applications that do not require trust and are censorship resistant.
