As a merchant trying to accept bitcoins, I couldn't agree with your post more!  
A few initial things that come to mind for this software would be:  
  
1\. Allow users to generate an unlimited number of keys for receiving, but
those same users can NOT send any money out.  
  
2\. Sending money requires authorization from two or more users. (No single
user can send money)  
  
I would be willing to help test this software in a real world environment if
needed.
