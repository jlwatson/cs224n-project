No markup? Yea right.  

  
It sure sounds like you are calling me a liar.  
I assure you that every item on the website is listed at the exact cost from
the vendor.

nobody involved with bitcoin is actually interested in or cares about
furthering bitcoin for any reason other than their own personal gain so
bitcoin to this day hasn't had anyone really go to bat for it.  

  
I promise you that my primary motivation for my involvement with Bitcoin is
philosophical and not financial.
