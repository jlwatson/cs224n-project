There is only one major change I would make.  
  
You can't really use Bitcoins to "buy or sell just about anything", at least
not in the way most people will think. You can probably find someone to buy
you just about anything, and then you pay them in Bitcoins, but you can't buy
the thing yourself.  

  
He seems to be sold out at the moment, but with this service, I would assume
you can buy just about anything:

Please continue to give me your feedback.
