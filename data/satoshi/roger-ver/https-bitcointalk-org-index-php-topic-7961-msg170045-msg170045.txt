I've been trying to buy from MemoryDealers.com using Bitcoins, but I can't.
The site shows me the price in USD, and when I check out it asks for credit
card or PayPal  

  
I'm working hard and fast to have an automated bitcoin shopping cart ASAP.  
If there is anything you would like for now, feel free to email me at
roger@memorydealers.com and I can take care of everything for you.
