I think it is more likely that an existing Bitcoin exchange will become a
government licensed bank rather than the other way around.  

  
do you ever think mtgox would go this route?  

  
I think it is possible that any of the exchanges could do this, but it takes A
LOT of money.  
At this time, I doubt any of the exchanges have enough money to do this.
