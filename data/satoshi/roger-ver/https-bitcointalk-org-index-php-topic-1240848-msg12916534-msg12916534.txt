 _Hey All,  
  
I'm Sam, CEO of Bitcoin Group Ltd. A pureplay Bitcoin Mining outfit that is
accepted to list on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in December, as a
profitable company, we're scheduled to be the first IPO in the Bitcoin space
to list on a major global exchange, raising up to 20m in the process.  
  
From an IT Project Management background, I fell in love with Bitcoin in 2012
(best thing since my two daughters) and started with Asher Tan (tomorrow's
AMA) the Melbourne Bitcoin Meetup (http://www.meetup.com/BitcoinMelbourne/) as
well as played with arbitraging between exchanges throughout 2013 through
Bitcoins Reserve (http://bitcoinsreserve.com). with long time friends Allan
Guo and Jin Chen.  
  
In 2014, having teamed up with Ryan "Martian" Xu (Think of him as the chinese
version of Roger Ver) and Jacob Cheng (SMSC Lead Engineer), we launched our
plans to IPO a Bitcoin Mining company in September 2014 and raised through an
earlier pre-IPO round of 3.6m from sophisticated investors to prove the
business model. (more at: http://www.bitcoingroup.com.au/our-story/ &

With listing just around the corner, we brought into the fold the bitcoin
community through the Melbourne Bitcoin Technology Center (MBTC:
http://bitcoincenter.co/) to help spread awareness and educate people on the
opportunities through a range of initiatives such as:
