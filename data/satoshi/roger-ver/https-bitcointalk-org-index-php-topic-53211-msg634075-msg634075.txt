Congrats Roger!  
  
Also I recommend this great interview with Charlie from BitInstant,  
  
http://onlyonetv.com/2011/11/the-bitcoin-show-episode-049-charlie-shrem-co-
founder-and-ceo-of-bitinstant-com/  
  
I got the idea from this interview that BitInstant is about more than just
instant transfers between exchanges, but instant transfers between every
payment system, sort of making individual payment systems irrelevant and all
completely liquid with each other. Also very clearly got the marketing message
- "It's your money"  
  

  
Actually, watching that interview was what made me finally commit to working
with Bitinstant.  
  
Bitinstant will have some VERY EXCITING announcements very soon.  
They will make Bitcoins MUCH easier and safer for everyone to use.  
  
Stay tuned!
