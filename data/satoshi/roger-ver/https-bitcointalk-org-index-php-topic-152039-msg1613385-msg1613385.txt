"The Bitcoin network is currently experiencing an irreconcilable fork  
between Bitcoin 0.8 and <0.8 nodes due to a block being mined by a  
Bitcoin 0.8 node which an elevated blocksize which older nodes are  
unable to handled.  
  
This issue will be resolved by mining power moving to the pre-0.8 fork  
and making it longer. Until this is resolved all transactions at and  
beyond block 225439 should be regarded as unconfirmed.  
  
Miners must move their hashpower back to 0.7.2 (or before) nodes or  
their blocks will be orphaned. Once the pre-0.8 chain is longer  
operation will resume as normal and a patch will be issued for 0.8 to  
avoid triggering this issue.  
  
Please see the Bitcoin-dev mailing list or contact me if more  
information is required. I will send out another email once the issue  
is resolved."
