Starting today, there will be two ads for bitcoin per day on 98 radio stations
across the country, plus XM Satellite radio, and the LRN.FM radio network.  
There will be one 30 second live read, and one 30 second recorded ad.  
The live read has been going for over a week now, the recorded ad will start
today.  
  
You can hear it here:

I'm paying $2,500 a month for these ads, so if you would like to help chip in
with the cost, please buy some networking equipment from me, or send a
donation to:

We need to get people using bitcoin in every day life!
