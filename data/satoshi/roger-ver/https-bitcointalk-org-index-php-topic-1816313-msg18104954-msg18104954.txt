Most pools have kept all of the fees until just recently, and many miners
suspect pools of stealing hash rate from them.  
  
Bitcoin.com will never steal any hash rate, and it is our goal to pay more
than every other mining pool in the world.  
(This likely already is the case)  
  
If the network fees continue to rise, we will be upping our pay out to 115% of
the block reward.  
Like the current 10%, the extra 15% would be coming from the TX fees.  
  
I'd love to see some reports back of exactly how our payout compares to other
pools miner for miner.  
  
  
Please give us a try, you won't be disappointed.
