Why did coinlab make a deal with Mt. Gox when this stuff had not been
resolved? That is one thing I just do not understand at all.  

I have no idea either. It seems stupid to me too.

As for you being a victim you are also a working partner with Mt. Gox, you
have a bit of a conflict of interest.

Now you are just making things up. I'm not a working partner of Mt. Gox.

edit: Your not being "active" with coinlab is not a defense. Sitting around
doing nothing is not a defense, it is pretty much exactly what we are saying
you have been doing. Nothing.  

You have no idea what I do each day, I was up until 3AM working on Bitcoin
last night, and got up at 9:30AM today to work on it more. I've been keeping
this kind of schedule for over 2.5 years now. It is unappreciative people like
you, who make me NOT want to help any more with the Bitcoinica situation.
Luckily for you, I know the rest of the victims don't share your same
attitude.
