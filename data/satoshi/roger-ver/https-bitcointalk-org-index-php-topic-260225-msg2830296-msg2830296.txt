I have no idea either. It seems stupid to me too.  
  
  
Now you are just making things up. I'm not a working partner of Mt. Gox.  
  
  
You have no idea what I do each day, I was up until 3AM working on Bitcoin
last night, and got up at 9:30AM today to work on it more. I've been keeping
this kind of schedule for over 2.5 years now. It is unappreciative people like
you, who make me NOT want to help any more with the Bitcoinica situation.
Luckily for you, I know the rest of the victims don't share your same
attitude.
