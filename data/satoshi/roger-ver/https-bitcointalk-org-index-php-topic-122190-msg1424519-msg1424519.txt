do you sell ubuntu laptops? i get nothing when i search for "linux or ubuntu
laptop".  

  
Unfortunately none of the major manufacturers seem to support this kind of
thing.  
I think the best I can do at this point is recommend asking someone like
www.system76.com to accept bitcoins,  
or buy a standard laptop from bitcoinstore.com and install ubuntu on it once
you receive it.
