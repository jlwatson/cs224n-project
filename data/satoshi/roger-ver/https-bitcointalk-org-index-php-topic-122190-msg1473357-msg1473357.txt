All prices are in USD in the database and are updated to the equivalent BTC
price every 5 minutes based on the feed from Bitpay.com  
  
  
Great idea! This will be implemented soon.  
  
  
The USD prices don't change. The final BTC price is calculated at the moment
of checkout.  
I will give some thought on the best way to make this clear on the site.
