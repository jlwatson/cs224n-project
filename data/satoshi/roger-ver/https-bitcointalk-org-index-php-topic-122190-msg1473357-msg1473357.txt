1- The bitcoin prices I see on bitcoinstore is exactly the price I'll pay?
Hope yes.  

All prices are in USD in the database and are updated to the equivalent BTC
price every 5 minutes based on the feed from Bitpay.com

2- I would like to see on Bitcoinstore the usd value of 1 bitcoin. (the value
used by bitcoinstore)  

Great idea! This will be implemented soon.

3- I would like to see on site, something like: (the bitcoinstore prices will
be refreshed in 5 minutes)  

The USD prices don't change. The final BTC price is calculated at the moment
of checkout.  
I will give some thought on the best way to make this clear on the site.
