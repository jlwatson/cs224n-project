Roger Ver is representing himself and his buddy Tihan. He didn't like the
releasing of the code, because he wanted a piece of pie. Despite the pie
actually being shit. But that doesn't matter when $$$. This is why Patrick is
hesitant I think. I don't know the specifics, but the sentiments are clear.  

  
Amir, you are making things up.  
I didn't like the releasing of the code because it resulted in another 40,000
BTC and $40,000 being stolen!  
All I wanted was my 25,000 BTC back.  
  
Had you and the Intersango team accepted the offer, every single person except
for myself, and 3 others would have gotten %100 of their money back, and this
mess would have been an ancient memory in the history of Bitcoin.
