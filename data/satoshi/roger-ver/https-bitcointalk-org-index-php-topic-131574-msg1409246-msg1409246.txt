This is **NO PASSWORD RESET** for Blockchain.info  
  
If you have a secure password, your money is safe no matter what.  
  
Otherwise I could have reset your password and taken the money you owe me.  
  

Can you contact another admin of blockchain.info and acting as someone else
that wants back his own wallet? (and giving the secretpass)  
If this is an open possibility, than it's better to find a way to make it
harder or better impossible.  
  

  
 **This is not possible.**  
  
There is no way for an admin or anyone else in the entire world other than
someone who knows the current password to change the password.  
If you kept your password a secret, then no one else in the entire world has
access to the funds in your blockchain wallet.
