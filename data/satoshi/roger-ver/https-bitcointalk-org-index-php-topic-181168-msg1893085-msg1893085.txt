For anyone who doesn't know me, I'm Roger Ver.  
  
Since discovering Bitcoin in late 2010, it has consumed every moment of my
life.  
  
My company, Memorydealers.com was the first semi-mainstream business to accept
Bitcoin as payment.  
  
I'm directly responsible for  
  
1\. National radio advertisements on more than 100 stations for over two
years. @ $2,800 / month http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pV9ptoCMyc  
2\. A Bitcoin Bilboard for over 2 years. @ $1,200 / month  
3\. Bitcoinstore.com  
4\. The Bitcoin Bet http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfydIbhduu0  
5\. I was the first and only outside investor in Bitinstant.com,
Blockchain.info, BuyBitcoin.co.kr and several others.  
6\. I was part of the seed investment round for Coinlab.com, Bitpay.com,
Kraken.com and several others.  
7\. I donated over $100,000 USD worth of Bitcoins to the Bitcoin foundation to
help get it started. (value at the time of the payment)  
8\. I've also donated more bitcoins than I can count to various charities,
organizations, and groups who's goals I support.  
  
The reason I have done all of the above is because of the philosophy I hold.  
I think that all human interactions should be on a voluntary basis.  
I'm opposed to using violence or threats to solve social problems.  
I see Bitcoin, combined with the internet, as the best tool the world has ever
seen for minimizing the amount of violence in our society.  
  
  
What I'm advocating isn't extreme.  
The governmental systems we have today, that murder hundreds of millions of
innocents, drop nuclear bombs, enforce sanctions, extort money under the
threat of violence, control capital flow, debase currencies, and retard the
overall rate of economic growth, causing everyone to be poorer than they
otherwise would have been, is extreme.  
  
Whether or not I end up listed on the press page, with every waking moment, I
will continue to promote Bitcoin and the voluntary world it will help to bring
us closer to.  
  
My philosophy aside, I do think it is clear that I'm great at promoting
Bitcoin:

I also think that the following people should also be added to the press page:  
  
Jon Matonis  
Erik Voorhees  
Jeff Berwick  
  
  
Bitcoin is about inclusion, not exclusion.
