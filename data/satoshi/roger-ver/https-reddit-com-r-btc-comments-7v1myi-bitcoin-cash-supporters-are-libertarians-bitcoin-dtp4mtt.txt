Thanks for taking the time to think about this.   I'm not concerned with income inequality at all.  Just because Bill Gates is a zillionaire doesn't mean anyone else is worse off.  I am concerned with absolute (not relative) poverty,  and the best system ever devised to help the poor is economic freedom.
