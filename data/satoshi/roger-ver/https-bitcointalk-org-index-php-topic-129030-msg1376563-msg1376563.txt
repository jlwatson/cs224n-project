I will donate 10 BTC to the person who produces the best redesign of:

The redesign should include all of the current pertinent information, plus
prominently display Bitcoin as a donation option since it is the  
ultimate currency of peace.  
  
Once it is live on the site, I will donate $1,000 USD worth of Bitcoins to
Antiwar.com  
  
Submission deadline is Wednesday Dec 5th at Midnight PST or 12 hours after the
