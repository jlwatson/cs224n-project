Fair enough. Title changed.  
  
Also, I tried to resend 5 BTCs with a 0.1 transaction fee (10x more than the
minimum) and after almost 2 hours the transaction still says 0/unconfirmed.  

  
Thanks for changing the title.  
The transaction fee is not the problem.  
You are just throwing money away with that.
