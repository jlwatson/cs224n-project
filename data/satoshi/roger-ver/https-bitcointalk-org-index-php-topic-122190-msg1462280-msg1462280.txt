Stop lying about amazon prices.  

  
Bentar,  
  
Stop spreading FUD.  
  
Here are some current examples as of Jan 18th 2013 in which Bitcoinstore.com
is clearly cheaper than Amazon.com  
  
Adtran Bluesocket 1840 - Wireless access point  
BitcoinStore $454  
Amazon $471  
  
  
HP LASERJET PRO 400 M451DN CLR  
BitcoinStore $494  
Amazon $509  
  
  
Wine Enthusiast Silent 12 Bottle Wine Refrigerator  
BitcoinStore $124  
Amazon $145  
  
  
Mitsubishi DLP Projector - 1080p - HDTV - 16:10 (UD8350U)  
BitcoinStore $9,022  
Amazon $11,719  
  
  
  
Bitcoin store is not cheaper than Amazon for every item, but it certainly is
for at least tens of thousands of items, and possibly for more than one
hundred thousand items.  
For just about everything else, Bitcoinstore will certainly be competitive
with Amazon.  
You also seem to be forgetting the very best part, you can pay with Bitcoin!  
Three people are working on the site full time, and it will only get better
with time.
