I will try to make a recording and put it online.  

  
The use of bitcoin is pretty clearly illegal in China. Though there is no
reason to expect illegality to stop Chinese people from using bitcoin, you
might want to reconsider making recordings.  

  
From what I understand, bitcoin would only be illegal if used for trading
physical goods.  
It would be no problem for virtual items.  
  
After speaking to hundreds of Chinese in the last few days, not a single one
have expressed concern over the legality.
