You should add a "message" or "label" to the "Click to Pay" URL. Perhaps
something like "Bitcoinstore.com order# 18272542". Then you are
autodocumenting the transactions for the users, and you'll appreciate them
having easy access to the order number when they contact you for various
reasons.  
  
Technically it should go in the "message" field, but I think Bitcoin-Qt
doesn't really use that field, so I think it has to go under "label." I've
talked to them about making the "message" field useful (marking the
transaction, instead of the address), but they don't do it, yet.  

  
This sounds like more of a comment for Bitpay.com since the checkout is
handled by them.  
I don't see it as much of a problem currently since all the information is
emailed to the customer as soon as they place their order.  
  
In other good news, the new side menu should be online within the next 24
hours.  
  
Please keep the suggestions and requests coming!
