  
This sounds like more of a comment for Bitpay.com since the checkout is
handled by them.  
I don't see it as much of a problem currently since all the information is
emailed to the customer as soon as they place their order.  
  
In other good news, the new side menu should be online within the next 24
hours.  
  
Please keep the suggestions and requests coming!
