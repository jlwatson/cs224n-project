Can someone at deepbit help me with my problem?  
I woke up this morning to discover that someone stole 135 BTC from my deepbit
account. (More than $1,000 USD worth currently)  
I'm trying to find someone at deepbit to help me with any logs of IP addresses
that may have logged into my account.  
  
I started the following thread about the theft:

Thank you for any help you may have!
