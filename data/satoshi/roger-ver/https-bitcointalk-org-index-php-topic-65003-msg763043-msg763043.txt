This will be huge!  
Will you also be supporting Alipay withdrawals?  
I am going to tell all my vendors in China about this!  

  
We will consider Alipay withdrawal option soon. Currently there's an API for
mass payments, but it requires a service contract with Alipay.  
  
When the CNY deposit volume is higher, we will have better chances of getting
the service contract signed.  

  
I suspect more of my vendors will be willing to accept payment in Bitcoins
once they know that they can instantly cash out via Alipay.  
Keep up the great work!  
  
I just started a feedzebirds campaign. Please help spread the word!
