I agree that constructive criticism is needed, but I am sick of seeing 1000
new threads that say:  
**_OMG, the Bitcoin world is coming to an end! SELL! SELL! SELL!_**  
  
I'm not even convinced that they are being posted by real people rather than
bots.  
  
Lets get rid of worthless posts that do nothing to contribute.
