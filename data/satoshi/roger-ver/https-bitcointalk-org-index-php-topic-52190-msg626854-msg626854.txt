Didn't mention the "have to wait for confirmations to be secure" in the radio
show. So I don't have to find it, what was the bitcoin debit card called? I'd
like to know how that works and with what debit card provider it works with.  

  
www.okpay.com offers it.  
I'm sure they are the first of many others that will offer similar services
soon.
