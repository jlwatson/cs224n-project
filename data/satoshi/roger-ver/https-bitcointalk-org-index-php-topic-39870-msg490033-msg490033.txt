So who still thinks it is a good idea to donate bitcoins to a fund that is not
yet sure it will even find a proper place to send the money to, which is
controlled by a guy who has lost 25k in bitcoins on an earlier occasion and is
now linked to shady stuff involving child prostitution (I'm not saying he did
anything, but it's definitely fishy enough for any charity organisation to
never want anythong to do with it)?  

  
I'm the one running all of this, and I have never been involved with any of
the things you just mentioned.  
So, YES, I do still think it is a GREAT idea.
