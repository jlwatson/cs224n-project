I just downloaded it on my iphone 5 and it works great - not full screen but
scans codes- send and receives just fine  

  
You should check out http://instawallet.org, cause they allow you to add a
bitcoin address to your passbook app, and it updates the balance automatically
and it really cool.  

  
Please provide more information on how to add a Bitcoin address to passbook.  
  
Thanks!
