Still no solution to this issue, and bitpay is not returning emails 2 days
since. iirc ~13btc sitting in yours or bitpays accounts due to the sites
glitches. If bitpay is performing as expected on your site why does your own
site come up in the bitpay frame site at checkout? Where is my refund? I paid
and your site or bitpays were not recognizing the payments so it just sat
there then said payment not received, request a refund, which I did and am
getting no replies from them now.  

  
You are requesting replies at 9PM on a Sunday evening.  
I'm sure one of the support staff will get back to you first thing on Monday
morning.  
If by some strange reason they don't, feel free to contact me directly and I
will help track down the exact issue personally.
