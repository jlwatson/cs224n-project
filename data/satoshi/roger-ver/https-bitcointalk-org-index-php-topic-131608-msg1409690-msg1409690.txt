To be clear, I agree with Roger that the dude deserves the scammer tag. It's
not his money...  

  
Actually Roger needs to prove that was HIS money. He needs to prove that he
owns

Would be hard to do since his agent said that they don't. So someone who owns
that address should file a scammer report.  
  

  
This address is actually owned by another customer of Bitcoinstore.com  
  
An employee of Bitcoinstore mistakenly asked the customer to send money to
this Bitcoin address.
