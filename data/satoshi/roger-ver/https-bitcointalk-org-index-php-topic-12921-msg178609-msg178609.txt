My vendors are now BEGGING me to pay them in bitcoins, and I am gladly doing
just that!  

  
Really? That's phenomenal!  

  
Not all of them yet, but more and more each week. One of them is considering
starting his own RMB to Bitcoin currency exchange too!  
Getting real busineses using bitcoins for day to day transactions is they key
to bitcoin's long term success.
