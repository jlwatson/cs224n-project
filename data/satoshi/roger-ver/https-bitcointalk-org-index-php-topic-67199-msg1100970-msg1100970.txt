We offered to take over bitcoinica and pay everyone back 100% of their claims
but instead you assholes twiddled your thumbs, hid and allowed even *more*
money to be stolen and now it is all going to be pissed away in receivership.
All you had to do was simply give control back to tihan but that was too much
trouble for you worthless...  

  
This is true. Had the Intersango trio lifted even one finger, likely everyone
would already have %100 of their money back with the exception of the four
plaintives listed on the lawsuit. (This was our offer to Intersango)
