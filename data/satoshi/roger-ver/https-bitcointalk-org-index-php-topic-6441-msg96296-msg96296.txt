This forum is a daily reminder to me of just how ingrained is the idea of
central control in contemporary culture. An exchange rate is just assumed to
be something centrally controlled by some agent like Mt. Gox, presumably
working for Satoshi or something.  
  
Reminds me of the Soviet officer who, when told there were no ID cards or
residence permits in England, asked in confusion, "How do you know how much
bread to bake?"  

  
What are you talking about? Obviously someone smart sets the rate. If people
did it on their own they would just pick a great rate for themselves. Okay,
give me $1000/coin.  
  
  

  
The exchange rate is always between the price that people are willing to pay
for bitcoins and the price people are willing to sell bit coins.  
  
It is not set by any single smart person. It is set by the aggregate demand
and supply of all the players in the bitcoin/Dollar exchange market.  
That's why it changes all the time.
