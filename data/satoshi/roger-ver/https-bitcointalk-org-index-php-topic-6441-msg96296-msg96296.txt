  
The exchange rate is always between the price that people are willing to pay
for bitcoins and the price people are willing to sell bit coins.  
  
It is not set by any single smart person. It is set by the aggregate demand
and supply of all the players in the bitcoin/Dollar exchange market.  
That's why it changes all the time.
