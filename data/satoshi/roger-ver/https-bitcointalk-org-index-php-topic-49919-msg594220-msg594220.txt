That's a rather large premium you're charging. It's actually even higher than
casascius' premium.  

  
I'm currently charging a 10% premium over casascius.  
He only accepts payment in Bitcoin, so he has zero chargeback risk, and no CC
or Paypal fees. (around 3% to 5%)  
  
After a few weeks, if everything goes smoothly, I may be able to lower the
premium a bit.
