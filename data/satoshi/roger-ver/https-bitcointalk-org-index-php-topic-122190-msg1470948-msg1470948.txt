For now, please check out the Home Appliances section:

The BTC/USD conversion rate used is $13.52 while Mt. Gox is at $17.44  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Just pointing this out so you can fix it, because it looks dishonest.  

  
*facepalm* No wonder I felt something was amiss here.  

  
The website displayed exchange rate is having trouble updating automatically
however the exchange rate at the actual checkout updates every 5 minutes.  
If the current exchange rate is $17.44 and it has been that rate for more than
5 minutes, that is the rate you will pay at checkout.
