Yes cheap Shipping to Australia  
  
btw can you ship a laptop via Express Mail International Flat Rate Envelope ?  

  
there is no way under known laws of physics that a packaged, new laptop would
fit in one of those envelopes. unless someone invented a TARDIS and i missed
it.  
  

  
We are still working on having the checkout automatically limit wich items are
allowed with which shipping options.  
There are 3 people actively working on improving the site so hopefully this
can be resolved soon.
