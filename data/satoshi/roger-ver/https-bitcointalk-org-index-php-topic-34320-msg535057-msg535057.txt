  
Unless something major happens, I fully intend to release my comments in the
future.  
I also agree that from a marketing perspective $10K is a bargain if it gets
any kind of media attention.  
So far, I haven't even had to put up the $10K since no one has accepted my
challenge.  
  
I do think Bitcoins will make some kinds of taxes very difficult to collect,
but others (like property taxes) will hardly be affected at all.  
Governments arguably, occasionally do some nice things, but they also murdered
over 150,000,000 innocent people in the last century alone.

I wont lose any sleep if somehow Bitcoin were to 'destroy the guvmint' but I
don't see that as a likely scenario.
