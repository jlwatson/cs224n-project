I actually expected it to get more press attention than it did so far.  

  
I suspect it's the same reason the New York conference didn't get much media
attention: Journalists don't want to feel they've been 'used' to pimp
someone's investment or simply provide publicity for some interest group.  
I'm not sneezing at 10K - but from a marketing perspective it would be cheap
if it did get mainstream media attention.

I also posted a link in the video description to an encrypted file that
contains my thoughts on why I offered this bet.

It may make for some interesting reading in the future, if/when I make it
public.  

  
I hope you release the password either way.. even if in the end something you
said in there is way off the mark, you don't look the type to get embarrassed
too easily  
  

  
Unless something major happens, I fully intend to release my comments in the
future.  
I also agree that from a marketing perspective $10K is a bargain if it gets
any kind of media attention.  
So far, I haven't even had to put up the $10K since no one has accepted my
challenge.  
  
I do think Bitcoins will make some kinds of taxes very difficult to collect,
but others (like property taxes) will hardly be affected at all.  
Governments arguably, occasionally do some nice things, but they also murdered
over 150,000,000 innocent people in the last century alone.

I wont lose any sleep if somehow Bitcoin were to 'destroy the guvmint' but I
don't see that as a likely scenario.
