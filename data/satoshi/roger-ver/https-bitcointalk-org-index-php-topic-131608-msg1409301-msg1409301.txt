So, if I have this right. A scammer gives blockchain.info his bitcoins for
safe keeping, scams the guy who runs it, and then complains that
blockchain.info might maybe want their BTC back even though that can't happen
anyway?  
  
GTFO!  
  
I think I'm going to go buy something off bitcoinstore.com just to counteract
your stupidity.  

  
Thank you for understanding what happend!!!
