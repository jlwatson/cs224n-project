It brings into question things like are the anonymous addresses actually
anonymous? If the owners get raided for whatever reason will they just turn on
all their users? I agree he owes you, but it is not worth it.  

  
I think it was not clarified: the address the extra bitcoins were sent to are
**not an anonymous address** that is part of Blockchain's mixer, it was just a
normal address in his blockchain wallet.
