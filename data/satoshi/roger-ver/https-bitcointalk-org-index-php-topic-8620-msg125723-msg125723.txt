Bitcoin prices will only continue to rise if people begin using bitcoins for
their every day transactions.  
We should be focusing on making it easy for everyone to use bitcoins in every
day life.  
  
This will help us individually and the world as a whole.  
  
The next time you want to buy something, ask the merchant to accept bitcoins.
