I'm proud to announce the beta launch of BitcoinStore.com  
BitcoinStore.com is the world's first, Bitcoin only, super store.  
We currently have more than 500,000 products available for immediate shipment,
including PCs, Laptops, Hard Drives, Printers, Digital Cameras, Monitors, TVs,
Software and more!  
Our prices are often lower than other major retailers like Amazon.com,
NewEgg.com and Buy.com  
This is possible because we have partnered with the worlds largest wholesale
technology distributor, and avoid traditional merchant fees because we accept
Bitcoin only.  
In the very near future, content from other partners will be added so we will
have more than 1,000,000 products and full international shipping support.  
  
Some current examples of great deals from BitcoinStore are:  
  
LG 55" 120HZ LED TV  
  
**BitcoinStore$1,163.17**  
Amazon $1,303.13

 **BitcoinStore$175.66**  
Amazon $202.01

and much much more!  
  
Domesting shipping is FREE on all orders over $100 USD.  
$4.99 shipping for all domestic orders under $100  
International FedEx and USPS shipping options are now available.  
 ~~There is currently a $1,000 order minium during our beta launch. (This will
be removed soon)~~  
  
In order to maintain these competitive prices, I will need to sell more than
$800K USD worth of goods per quarter, so please place your orders and help
spread the word!  
  
Please post your questions, bug reports, and feature requests in the thread
