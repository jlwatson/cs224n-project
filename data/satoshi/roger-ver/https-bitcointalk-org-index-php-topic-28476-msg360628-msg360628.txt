Doesn't it hurt anonymity if you have a constant receiving address in that
everyone could look up how much money you've been receiving?  

  
Yes, but for merchants who care about this, they can easily print up a new
sheet with a new address each day.  
This isn't meant to be a long term solution for large merchants. It is just a
way for mom and pop shops to easily accept bitcoin.
