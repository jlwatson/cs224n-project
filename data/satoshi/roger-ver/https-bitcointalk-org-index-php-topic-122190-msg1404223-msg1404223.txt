The exchange rate when calculating prices in USD seems a little low?  

  
This displayed exchange rate has been fixed.  
The exchange rate at checkout is always calculated by Bitpay via their
formula: https://bitpay.com/bitcoin-exchange-rates  
This way the customer is always guaranteed to get the very best rate possible
for their Bitcoins.
