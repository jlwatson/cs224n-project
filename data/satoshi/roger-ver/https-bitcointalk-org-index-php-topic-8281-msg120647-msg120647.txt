I just head that the thief logged in from IP address:

Please help!
I woke up this morning, logged into my deepbit account at 7:35AM PST on
5-14-2011 to see how things were going, and someone had transfered all my
bitcoins to address:
15YaS8ux9u6YUrS6DmdTZa1NaLecNNNCKT and set it continue to send to that address
as soon as my account received even 0.01 additional bitcoins.

My password was a combination of letters and numbers, and I assumed it was
reasonably secure. (perhaps not)
The only people who knew my password, were myself, and a couple of other
employees at MemoryDealers, and all of them say they did not change anything.

The following information comes up in that address in the block explorer:

Note: While the last "balance" is the accurate number of bitcoins available to
this address, it is likely not the balance available to this person. Every
time a transaction is sent, some bitcoins are usually sent back to yourself at
a new address (not included in the Bitcoin UI), which makes the balance of a
single address misleading. See the wiki for more info on transactions.

Does anyone know how I can try to track down who stole my bitcoins and where
they went?!!!!!

Any help/insight would be greatly appreciated!
