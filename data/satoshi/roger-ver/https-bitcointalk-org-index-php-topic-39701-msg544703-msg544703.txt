America is banned, see the main board for details...  
this doesn't affect any depositors. America's a rogue country, in defiance of
WTO rules, and we're tired of their citizens consistently lying to us about
their identity. We hope our Canadian, South American, Asian and European
players will understand and appreciate our efforts toward increased legitimacy
and legality, even if it costs us some play-cash action.  

  
Can you please post a link to the "main board" mentioned above?  
  
Are US Citizens living abroad allowed to play?
