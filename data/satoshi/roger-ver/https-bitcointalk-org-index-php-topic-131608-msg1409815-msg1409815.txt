  
I would like to clarify that the funds did not come from Bitpay. (I was
mistaken in an earlier post)  
They actually came from another Bitcoinstore.com customer.  
This customer was mistakenly told to send the funds to the wrong address.  
  
I understand the confusion and anger that was caused by my using information
from Blockchain.info for Bitcoinstore purposes.  
I apologize for my lack of judgment in regards to this, but I think it should
be noted that I simply disclosed a users own information to himself in order
to prove that he was lying to me.  
  
I never disclosed his blockchan.info information to an unrelated third party.
