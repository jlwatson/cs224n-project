  
Wow, you got every single point wrong.  
  
1\. I want Bitcoin to be uncontrollable p2p cash as described in Satoshi's
white-paper. (Not just a settlement layer)  
  
2\. Decentralization is the tool Bitcoin uses to achieve its censorship
resistance.  
  
3\. Read the white-paper and you will see that unlike Blockstream and Core,
I'm advocating for the very thing that Bitcoin was designed to be from day
one.
