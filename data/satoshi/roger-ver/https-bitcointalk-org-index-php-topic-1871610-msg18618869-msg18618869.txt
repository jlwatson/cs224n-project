Roger Ver wanting nodes to be centralized & easier to control what people
should expect him to say.  
  
Roger Ver is against bitcoin being decentralized.  
  
Everything about him is the inverse opposite of what bitcoin was designed to
be.  

  
Wow, you got every single point wrong.  
  
1\. I want Bitcoin to be uncontrollable p2p cash as described in Satoshi's
white-paper. (Not just a settlement layer)  
  
2\. Decentralization is the tool Bitcoin uses to achieve its censorship
resistance.  
  
3\. Read the white-paper and you will see that unlike Blockstream and Core,
I'm advocating for the very thing that Bitcoin was designed to be from day
one.
