I think you could potentially have a HUGE hit on your hands if you set it up
so all the credits are actually Bitcents.  
  
  
People could use your site as an online wallet as well as a auction site.  
  
Anytime someone bids on an auction, it would transfer one bitcent from the
bidder's account into the auction poster's account.  
  
People could deposit or withdraw their bitcoins at any time.  
  
If you set it up like this, I suspect people would flood into your site to
sell their stuff, and bid on stuff for sale.  
  
If you get something this good all setup, I would be willing to do some radio
advertising for you as well. (on more than 100 radio stations across the USA
with www.freetalklive.com)  
  
Any thoughts?
