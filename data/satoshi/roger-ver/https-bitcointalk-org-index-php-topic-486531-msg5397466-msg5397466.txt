Either Mark or Gonzague.

I wrote it all myself.


Nothing other than a customer of Mtgox.

Having liquidity is no guarantee of solvency. In hindsight, we now know that
Mtgox has likely been insolvent for years.
I'm sorry you have a hard time understanding the difference.

Because as stated in the video, I am sure the fiat withdrawal delays at that
time were not caused by a lack of liquidity.
In hindsight, I feel terrible about having made the video. I was deceived by
Mtgox, and my video led to who knows how many more people trusting Mtgox, and
losing money because of it. If I could go back in time, I would never have
made the video.

Isn't it clear to anyone who is paying attention? Mtgox lost everyones
bitcoins and didn't notice until 99% of them were gone.

I found out this week as well.

I have had about 24,000 BTC from Bitcoinica stuck in Mtgox for over a year.
Mark refused to turn over those funds to the liquidator. Now any chance I had
of getting those back are gone too. **That likely makes me one of the people
who lost the most money out of everyone involved with this MtGox nightmare.**

I'm the one who directly asked Mark to step down.

I wasn't in Tokyo for most of the protest, but the one day I was, I tried to
bring them hot tea.
  
The picture I am talking about is Bitcoin, not my interactions with Mtgox.
