On the weekend from May 31st to June 3rd, myself and several friends will
compete in the World Brazilian Jujitsu championships in LA.  
The event will be streamed live to thousands of people, DVDs will be made of
the event, and there will be tons of press present.  
Jujitsu practitioners are not the normal target for new Bitcoiners, but every
bit of advertising helps.  
  
Myself and a few of my friends would like to sow Bitcoin logos onto the back
of our Jujitsu Gis.  
Something similar to the patches seen in this video would be great:

Can someone make these and sell them to me ASAP?  
  
I would like to buy at least 5 pcs.  
  
  
Thanks!
