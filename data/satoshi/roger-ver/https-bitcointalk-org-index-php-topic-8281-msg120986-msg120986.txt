I still think the most likely is that a browser window was left unattended
while logged in.  

  
The strange part is that it was done at about **5:30AM** PST (where my office
is)  
There are lots of cameras at the office that I can check soon, but no one but
myself has access at that time of day.  
  
So I suspect it was done somewhere other than at the location of the mining
computers.
