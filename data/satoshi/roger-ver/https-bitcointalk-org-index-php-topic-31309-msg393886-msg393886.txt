The current Bitcoin radio ad has been running for several months on
www.freetalklive.com on more than 100 stations accross the USA, including XM
satellite radio.  
Station list here: http://www.freetalklive.com/affiliates  
  
The current ad is here:

I think it is about time to update the content of the ad to reflect the
current state of bitcoins.  
Please give me some ideas of what you would like to hear in the new ad.  
  
The radio program is geared towards supporters of liberty, so some topics that
come to mind are:  
  
1\. The government can not seize your bitcoins, or freeze your bitcoin
account.  
2\. You can use them to play poker/gamble online.  
3\. You can use them anywhere in the world.  
4\. Great Bitcoin app for Android.  
5\. Restaurants and real world businesses are starting to accept Bitcoins.  
6\. Your idea here.....  
  
If you appreciate my efforts, please feel free to send a few bitcents to:
