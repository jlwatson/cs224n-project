Bitbet.us is down again, and this time it looks like it is down for good.  
I thought this site was very interesting so I have hired a developer to create
a similar one hosted by Bitcoin.com  
I would love some feedback from the community on what features you would like
it to have.  
The developer has started a thread about it here:
https://forum.bitcoin.com/topic32927.html  
Please post your feature requests there, and we will build it.
