A potential problem with this is that people might not know what exactly
bitcoins are, while your ad is already talking about how to buy them. You
might want to listen to a few of the ads that go like, "Do you hate fiat
money? There's one investment that works! Gold! Gold has gone up blahblahblah
over the past 10 years," because something like that would tell the listener
what you're talking about.  

  
For the last 6 months or so a general ad about Bitcoins has been running, so
most of the listeners have been hearing about them for months.  
  
Here is a copy of the old ad:
