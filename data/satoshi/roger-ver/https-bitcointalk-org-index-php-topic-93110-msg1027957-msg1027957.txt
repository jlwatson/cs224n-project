Very sorry, Roger. I don't know what your options are at this point. It's
looking more and more like this is going to be the way to go, but I doubt
that'll end up being very satisfying in the end. This is a real mess.  

  
I don't know if it is coincidence, but Bitcoinica announced the latest hacking
one day after myself and three other major creditors threatened to take legal
action. The timing seems too convenient for them.
