Hi Everyone!  
  
As one of the first online retailers to accept Bitcoin as payment, we are
excited to offer a 15% DISCOUNT for all orders payed for with Bitcoin before
August 31st!  
  
For those not yet familiar with Bitcoin, it is like cash that you can send
over the internet! It is as anonymous as you want it to be, and it's basically
free to use! Learn more about Bitcoin, the new peer-to-peer digital currency.
