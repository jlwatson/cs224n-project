This is awesome! Which tablet company is it?  

  
I don't want to step on any toes, so I will let Yifu check with the company to
see if they are ready to have their intentions be publicly known.  
  
  
Also, I believe the idea is to install software in each tablet that relays new
Bitcoin transactions throughout the network.  
It would not store the entire blockchain. I will need advice from the core
developers in regards to what will be the most useful and practical.  
If the Bitcoin software degrades the end user experience, I don't think they
will be willing to install it.
