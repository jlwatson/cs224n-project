My sense is that question 6 is a better question to ask than 5. That is, what's important isn't drawing some theoretical distinction between fair and unfair problems, but finding out what problems we and/or our agents will actually face. To the extent that we are ignorant of this now but may know more in the future when we are smarter and more powerful, it argues for not fixing a formal decision theory to determine our future decisions, but instead making sure that we and/or our agents can continue to reason about decision theory the same way we currently can (i.e., via [philosophy](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2id/metaphilosophical_mysteries/)).
