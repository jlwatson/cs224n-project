Call me stuck in ordinary decision theory, with less than universal values.  I mostly seek info that will help me now make choices to assist myself and my descendants, given what I already know about us.  The fact that I might have wanted to commit before the universe began to rating universes as better if they had later filters is not very relevant for what info I now will call "bad news."
