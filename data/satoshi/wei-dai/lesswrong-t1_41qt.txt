&gt;I imagine that the moral intuitions in my brain come from a special black box within it, a "morality core" whose outputs I cannot easily change.

What does your "morality core" tell you when you ask it "How exactly should I rearrange the universe (or a significant part of it), if I had the power to rearrange it any way I want?"

Mine seems to say "I don't know, but if you ever get the opportunity, be sure to do it *right*, or at least get what you *really* want." So here I am, trying to figure out what that could mean. :)
