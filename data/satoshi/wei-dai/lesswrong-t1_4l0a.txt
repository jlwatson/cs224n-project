&gt;notwithstanding that I know very well the universe is not constrained by my ideas of efficiency, it still strikes me as grossly inefficient to the point of inelegance for the universe to perform infinite computation of which only a finite fraction can be used even in principle.

As someone with the occasional hobby of hand optimizing assembly code, I can certainly empathize with that intuition. But I think it's wrong. Even assuming that efficiency-as-elegance is epistemically relevant, efficiency can only be defined relative to a model of computation, and there is no reason to think that the model of computation we usually have in mind, due to being familiar with such computers in our daily lives, is relevant for what is efficient/elegant for the universe.

It might help to recalibrate your intuitions to consider the following. Suppose we eventually build a quantum computer that can factor large integers in polynomial time. To simulate such a quantum computer using a classical computer would take exponential time, whereas there are known subexponential (more than polynomial but less than exponential) time classical factoring algorithms. Would it be somehow grossly inefficient for nature to "actually" do quantum computation when we turn on that quantum computer, instead of quietly substituting a subexponential classical factoring computation behind the scenes?

If the epistemically relevant model of computation is not a classical computer, but at least a quantum computer, then why can't it be a computer that handles continuous mathematical structures as easily as it handles discrete ones, or one that can query halting oracles?
