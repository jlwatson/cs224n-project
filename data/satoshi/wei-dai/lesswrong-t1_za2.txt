Racist statements don't seem to automatically imply lower status for the offended group. For example, many people found [this "joke"](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29423045/) offensive, even though the only claim seems to be that black people eat lots of watermelon. Similarly, a statement like "Jews control the financial system" could easily offend Jews, even though if anything it assigns them high status.
