I wish there is an area of science that gives reductionist explanations of morality, that is, the detailed contents of our current moral values and norms. One example that came up earlier was monogamy - why do all modern industrialized countries have monogamy as a social norm?

The thing that's puzzling me now is egalitarianism. As Carl Shulman pointed out, the [problem](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2b7/hacking_the_cev_for_fun_and_profit/) that CEV has with people being able to cheaply copy themselves in the future is shared with democracy and other political and ethical systems that are based on equal treatment or rights of all individuals within a society. Before trying to propose alternatives, I'd like to understand how we came to value such equality in the first place.
