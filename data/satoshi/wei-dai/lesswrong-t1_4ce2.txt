One more way to describe this idea. I ask, "What is morality?", and you say, "I don't know, but I use this brain thing here to figure out facts about it; it errs sometimes, but can provide limited guidance. Why do I believe this "brain" is talking about morality? It says it does, and it doesn't know of a better tool for that purpose presently available. By the way, it's reporting that &lt;long list of conditions&gt; are morally relevant, and is probably right."
