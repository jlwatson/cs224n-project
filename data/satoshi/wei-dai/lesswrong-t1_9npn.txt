&gt;  What kind of scientific progress are you envisioning, that would eventually tell us how much hedonic value a given collection of atoms represents? Generally scientific theories can be experimentally tested, but I can't see how one could experimentally test whether such a hedonic value theory is correct or not.

You apply your moral sentiments to the facts to determine what to do. As you suggest, you don't look for them in other objects. I wouldn't be testing my moral sentiments per say, but what I want to do with the world depends on how exactly it works and testing that so I can best achieve this would be great 

Figuring out more about what can suffer what can feel happiness would be necessary and some other questions would be useful to answer.

Moral realism vs. non realism can be a long debate but hopefully this will at least tell you where we are coming from even if you disagree.
