I've seen that essay linked a few times and finally took the time to read it carefully. Some thoughts, for what they're worth:

What exactly is a code? (Apparently they can be genetic or memetic, information theory and Hayek both have something to say about them, and social traditions are instances of them.) How do you derive, refute or justify a code?

There are apparently evolved memetic codes that solve interpersonal problems - how do we know that memetic evolution selects for good solutions to interpersonal problems, and that it doesn't select even more strongly for something useless or harmful, like memorability or easy transmission to children or appeal to the kinds of people in the best position to spread their ideas to others or making one feel good? Why isn't memetic evolution as much of [an](http://lesswrong.com/lw/8bl/link_back_to_the_trees/) [amoral](http://lesswrong.com/lw/kw/the_tragedy_of_group_selectionism/) [Azathoth](http://lesswrong.com/lw/kr/an_alien_god/) as biological evolution? The results of memetic evolution are just the memes that were best at surviving and reproducing themselves. These generally have no reason to be objectively true. I'm not convinced that there's any reason they should be intersubjectively true (socially beneficial) either. Also, selection among entire social systems seems to require group selection. 

And granted that the traditions that are the results of the process of memetic/cultural evolution contain valuable truths, are those truths in the actual *content* of the traditions, or are they just in what we can infer from the fact that these were the particular traditions that resulted from the process?
