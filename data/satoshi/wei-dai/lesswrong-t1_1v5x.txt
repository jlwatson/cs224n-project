Thank you for introducing me to the "universal prior".

The model I'd have used in explaining a sequence of such coin flips would indeed assume that the machine generates each coin independently as heads-biased with fixed probability H.  But rather than fixing H=1/2, I'd have a prior distribution for H (probably uniform).

How superior would the universal prior be to this?  I confess I can't do the math.
