Skill at making such choices is itself a specialty, and doesn't mean you'll be good at other things.  Indeed, the ability to properly choose algorithms in one problem domain often doesn't make you an expert at choosing them for a different problem domain.  And as the software economy becomes more sophisticated these distinctions will grow ever sharper (basic Adam Smith here -- the division of labor grows with the size of the market).  Such software choosers will come in dazzling variety: they like other useful or threatening software will not be general purpose.  And who will choose the choosers?  No sentient entity at all -- they'll be chosen they way they are today, by a wide variety of markets, except that there too the variety will be far greater.   

Such markets and technologies are already far beyond the ability of any single human to comprehend, and that gap between economic and technological reality and our ability to comprehend and predict it grows wider every year.  In that sense, the singularity already happened, and long ago.
