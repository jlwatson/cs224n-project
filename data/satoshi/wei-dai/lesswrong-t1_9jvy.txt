Assuming that we don't discount future (or not currently existent) people, surely ripple effects far outweigh the lives directly saved. But many other actions have ripple effects too. Can anyone "prove" that the ripple effects of donating to the cause of saving lives in developing countries is more positive than, for example, improving US education? If not, why target current donations to charities that are able to prove that they are effective at directly saving lives? This would be equivalent to education charities proving that they are effective at raising students' grades, which I think you'd agree would not by itself warrant donating to those charities.
