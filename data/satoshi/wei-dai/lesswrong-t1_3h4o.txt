&gt; Isn't it possible that it only looks like "heuristics all the way down" because we haven't dug deep enough yet?

Everything's possible, but doesn't seem plausible at this point, and certainly not at human level. To conclude that something is not a heuristic, but the thing itself, one would need too much certainty to be expected of such a question.

&gt; What is the nature of morality according to your approach? You say that a human can't know what they care about (which I assume you use interchangeably with "right", correct me if I'm wrong here). 

I did use that interchangeably.

&gt; Is it because they can't, in principle, fully unfold the logical definition of right, or is it that they can't even define "right" in any precise way?

Both (the latter). Having an explicit definition would correspond to "preference" which I discussed in the grandparent comment. But when we talk of merely "precise", at least in principle we could hope to obtain a significantly more precise description, maybe even on human level, which is what meta-ethics should strive to give us. Every useful heuristic is an element of such a description, and some of the heuristics, such as laws of physics, are very precise.

&gt; How is an agent supposed to design a set of heuristics without such a precise definition to guide it? 

The current heuristics, its current implementation, which is understood to be fallible.

&gt; Also, if the agent itself uses the words "morality" or "right", what do they refer to?

Don't know (knowing would give a definition). To the extent it's known, see the current heuristics (long list), maybe brains.
