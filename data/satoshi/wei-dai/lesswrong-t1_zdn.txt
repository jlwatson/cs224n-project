What I'm saying is that if you can get the AI to choose between decision algorithms, then you can code a decision-algorithm-chooser that searches through many decision algorithms and picks the best one, instead of having to do all that work yourself.  Like the difference between the amount of work put in by human chessplayers to build up the human skill of chess over centuries, versus the effort of the programmers to build Deep Blue to search the game tree for good strategies.  It's *conceptually* much harder work to find the source of the source of the source and build the seed of the seed of the seed, it's more *confusing* labor, but if you don't have a few centuries to spare, you had better look for the generator and not try to duplicate the output.
