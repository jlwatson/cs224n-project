If one accepts any kind of multiverse theory, even just [Level I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse#Level_I:_Beyond_our_cosmological_horizon), then an infinite number of sentient organisms already exist, and it seems that we cannot care about each individual equally without running into serious problems. I previously [suggested](http://lesswrong.com/lw/nc/newcombs_problem_and_regret_of_rationality/1265) that we discount each individual using something like the length of its [address in the multiverse](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1zx/addresses_in_the_multiverse/).
