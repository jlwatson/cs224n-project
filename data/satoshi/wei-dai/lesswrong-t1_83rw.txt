I would say that what I did is more like continuing to care about continuity, but trying to put it into causal continuity or pattern continuity after the particular hypothesis of 'particle identity continuity' turned out to be nonsense.  Also, I regard this as a problem not strictly of utility functions because it controls what I *expect to see happen* after being cryonically revived or stepping into a Star Trek transporter - I either see the next moment, or see what happens after dying in a car crash i.e. NULL.  Yes, I'm aware that this last part is confused, but just because I'm confused about something epistemic doesn't mean that it gets packed into utility functions.  I shall have to write a post about this at some point.
