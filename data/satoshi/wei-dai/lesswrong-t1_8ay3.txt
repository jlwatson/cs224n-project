This outline seems like it could be very useful!  I like this post.  

I am confused about what is meant by 1.1 though.  Are you referring to some hypothetical potentially real external agent who can tell us something about what to value?  Or are you saying we can learn what someone values by observing their religious beliefs?  Or simply that a person's religious beliefs inform their morals?
