It seems someone should link up "Why and How to Debate Charitably."  I can't find a copy of the original because the author has taken it down.  Here is a [discussion of it on LW.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/58x/link_why_and_how_to_debate_charitably/).  Here are my [bulleted summary quotes.](http://permut.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/why-and-how-to-debate-charitably/)  ADDED: [Original essay](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=15703)  I've just learned, and am very saddened to hear, that the author, Chris, committed suicide some time ago.
