Friendly AI is a humongous damn multi-genius-decade sized problem.  The first step is to realize this, and the second step is to find some fellow geniuses and spend a decade or two solving it.  If you're looking for a quick fix you're out of luck.

The same (albeit to a lesser degree) is fortunately also true of Artificial General Intelligence in general, which is why the hordes of would-be meddling dabblers haven't killed us all already.
