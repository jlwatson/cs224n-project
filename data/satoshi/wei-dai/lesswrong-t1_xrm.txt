Re: Toby's "Regardless of the actual computational limits of our universe, I have no doubt that the study of hypercomputation will lead to many important theoretical results across computer science, philosophy, mathematics and physics."

Hmm.  What have we got so far out of Omegas and Oracles?  I expect what we will get out of Hypercomputation will be mostly confusion - since it *sounds* as though it is a field with a real object of study.
