I've been wondering how much evidential value the rise of Bitcoin offers for the success of a basement-style FAI project. Unfortunately I don't have a lot of time to participate on LW recently but has anyone else thought in this direction? (Sorry, this isn't directly related to the OP but I figure more interested people will see it here than in open thread.)
