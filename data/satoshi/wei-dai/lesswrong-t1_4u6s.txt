Bugreport: I'm getting intermittent failures, wherein http://lesswrong.com/reader instantly returns a blank page (no header, no "Please wait while new comments are being loaded"). When this happens, it also forgets my history of read comments.

Attempted trace: http://www.ibiblio.org/weidai/lesswrong_comments2.php returned http error 500. The forgetting consists of the "remove old ids" loop running on an empty list of new comments, thus thinking that everything is old.
