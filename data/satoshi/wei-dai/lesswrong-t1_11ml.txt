Actually it makes less sense now, since your explanation seems to agree that two "TDT" algorithms that know each of them is "TDT" won't necessarily cooperate, which undermines my hypothesis for why you were talking about cooperation as a sure thing in *some* relation to "TDT". I still think you make that assumption though. Citation from your argument:
&gt; 4\. If, in any identifiable group of people, a sufficient fraction switches to TDT, and that proportion is public knowledge, the TDT-running individuals in that group should start playing cooperate in one-shot PD with other members of the group.
