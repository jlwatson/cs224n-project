To whoever is upvoting this, it seems like you must be taking one of the following positions:

1. It is safe to post any view on LessWrong. Doing so will not get you in trouble, or cause blowups.
2. It is unsafe to post certain views on LessWrong, but if you hold such a view, you are morally obliged to argue for it and suffer the punishment (possibly at the hands of me or my allies).
3. It is unsafe to post certain views on LessWrong, and you are allowed not to argue for them, but you are *not* allowed to suggest that this unsafety has any sort of distorting effect on the resulting discussion.

Could you guys clarify?
