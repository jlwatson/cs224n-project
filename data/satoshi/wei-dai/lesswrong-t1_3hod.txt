On "right" in moral arguments. Why does it make sense to introduce the notion of "right" at all? Whenever we are faced with a moral argument, we're moved by *specific* moral considerations, never abstract rightness. There is a mystery: what makes these arguments worth being moved by? And then we have the answer: they possess the livening quality of elan vital (ahem) meta-ethical morality. 

It begins to look more and more compelling to me that "morality" is more like phlogiston than fire, a word with no explanatory power and moving parts that just lumps together all the specific reasons for action, and has too many explanatory connotations for an open question.
