&gt; So, granted that it's human to want friendship, community, etc., I'm still curious whether it's also human to care less about these things after realizing that they boil down to status and alliance games, and that the outcomes of these games don't count for much in the larger scheme of things.

Well, is it also human to stop desiring tasty food once you realize that it boils down to [super-stimulation](http://lesswrong.com/lw/h3/superstimuli_and_the_collapse_of_western/) of hardware that evolved as a device for impromptu chemical analysis to sort out nutritionally adequate stuff from the rest? 

As for the "larger scheme of things," that's one of those emotionally-appealing sweeping arguments that can be applied to literally *anything* to make it seem pointless and unworthy of effort. Selectively applying it is a common human bias. (In fact, I'd say it's a powerful general technique for producing biased argumentation.)
