&gt;Suppose I hear Bob say "I want to eat an apple." Am I justified in assigning a higher probability to "Bob wants to eat an apple" after I hear this than before (assuming I don't have some other evidence to the contrary, like someone is holding a gun to Bob's head)? 

I think this question hits the nail on the head. You are justified in assigning a higher probability to "Bob wants to eat an apple" just in case you are already justified in taking Bob to be a rational agent (other things being equal...). If Bob isn't at least minimally rational, you can't even get so far as construing his words as English, let alone to trust that his intent in uttering them is to convey that he wants to eat an apple (think about assessing a wannabe AI chatbot, here). But in taking Bob to be rational, you are already taking him to have preferences and beliefs, and for there to be things which he ought or ought not to do. In other words, you have already crossed beyond what mere natural science provides for. This, anyway, is what I'm trying to argue.
