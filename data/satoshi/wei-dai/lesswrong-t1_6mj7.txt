Weighing back in here, I will clarify my comment which the comment you quote was based on, that my OH had this precise thought ("self-important pompous fools") when he came across this site initially. The content of the sequences he found trivial. He generally finds it easy to be rational, and didn't see the point of getting a community together to learn how to be more rational. In fact, it's a large (reverse) inferential distance for him just to understand that some people find figuring these ideas out actually non-trivial (and yet still care about them). He doesn't understand how people can compartmentalise their minds at all.

Very few people sort themselves in bands according to "rationality", and my OH takes part in just regular discussions with regular smart people, except he's better at correcting wrong arguments than most. "Some people being unfixably wrong about things" is just a part of life for him, and without ideas like transhumanism to motivate you, it's quite hard to bring yourself to care about how wrong the rest of the world is - just being right yourself is sufficient.
