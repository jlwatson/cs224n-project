My current position is I don't know what the correct action to take to nudge the world the way I want. The world seems to be working somewhat at this point and any nudge may send it into a path towards something that doesn't work (even sub-human AI might change the order of the world so much it stops working).

So my strategy is to try and prepare a nudge that could be used in case of emergencies.  While trying to live a semi-normal life as well and cope with akrasia etc, it is not going quickly.
