&gt; Why do you think this is so important? As far as I can tell, this is not how humanity made progress in the past.

This actually seems to me *exactly* how humanity has made progress - countless fields and paradigms clashing and putting various perspectives on problems and making progress. This is a basic philosophy of science perspective, common to views as dissimilar as Kuhn and Feyerabend. There's no one model that dominates in every field (most models don't even dominate their field; if we look at the ones considered most precise and successful like particle physics or mathematics, we see that various groups don't agree on even methodology, much less data or results).
