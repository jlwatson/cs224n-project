Piano and ballet seem like upper-class costly signalling. "I am so rich I can spend tons of time doing unproductive activities." If you *are* upper-class and if you *want* to signal it costly, it could be the right move, otherwise it is almost certainly the wrong move; such is the nature of *costly* signals.

Sports seem useful *per se*. Unless you mean golf or pony riding, of course.
