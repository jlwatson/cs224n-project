This is the exact debate currently being hashed out by [Richard Joyce](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/staff/richard_joyce/) and [Stephen Finlay](http://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1003248&amp;CFID=1912369&amp;CFTOKEN=10963326) (whom I interviewed [here](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=3905)). A while back I wrote an article that can serve as a good entry point into the debate, [here](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=3584). A response from Joyce is [here](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/staff/richard_joyce/acrobat/joyce_accidental.error.theorist.pdf) and [here](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/staff/richard_joyce/acrobat/joyce_error.in.the.error.theory.pdf). Finlay replies again [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~finlay/ReplytoJoyce.pdf).

I tend to side with Finlay, though I suspect not for all the same reasons. Recently, Joyce has admitted that [both languages can work](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/staff/richard_joyce/acrobat/joyce_metaethical.pluralism.pdf), but he'll (personally) talk the language of error theory rather than the language of moral naturalism.
