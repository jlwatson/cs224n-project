The tricky part for me was proving the equivalence of two views of the Solomonoff prior: as a probability distribution over programs that print bitstrings and never make mistakes, and as a mixture of all "lower semi-computable" probability distributions over finite prefixes of bitstrings that *are* allowed to make mistakes. Once you derive the second view from the first, the conclusion is indeed trivial.
