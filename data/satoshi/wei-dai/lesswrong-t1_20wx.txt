Voted up as this is an important and general question about converting human intuitions into a formal utility function. 

&gt; What makes the desire to obtain high status within some small group a legitimate piece of Godshatter (good), as opposed to a kind of scope insensitivity (bad)?

Do we have a general criterion for deciding these things? Or is it still unresolved in general? 

In this specific case, it seems to me that there are many aspects of social interaction that are zero-sum or even negative sum. For the purpose of Coherent Extrapolated Volition, zero sum or negative sum elements are like scope insensitivity, i.e. bad. 

There are clearly some social status games that are positive sum.
