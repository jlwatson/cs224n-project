Yep. Until/unless our understanding of physics improves, we can't get any evidence for or against MWI. Our only reason for preferring it is that it sounds simple and thus should have lower prior. But it's a weird kind of "narrative simplicity", not mathematical (Kolmogorov) simplicity, because mathematically there's only one quantum mechanics and no interpretations. So I wonder why people care about MWI as anything more than an (admittedly very nice) intuition pump for studying QM.
