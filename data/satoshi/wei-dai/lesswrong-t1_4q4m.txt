One might have assigned significant prior probability to there being hundreds of sequential hard innovations required for human intelligence, e.g. in brain design. There might have ten, a hundred, a billion. If the hard steps model, combined with substantial remaining time in our habitable window, can lop off almost all of the probability mass assigned to those scenarios (which involve hard intelligence), that is a boost for the easy intelligence hypothesis.

Also, the fewer hard innovations that humans must replicate in creating AI, the more likely we are to succeed.
