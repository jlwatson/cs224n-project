Perhaps individual philosophers honestly seek answers, but academic philosophy as an institution has evolved to not really seek answers. That is, mechanisms that promote the spread of true ideas have atrophied or were never built, while mechanisms to promote diversity of positions have proliferated, without anyone consciously wanting these things to happen.

(This is just a guess as I'm not really familiar with the inner workings of academia.)
