We have the universal explorer - it will figure out everything, if it survives, but it'll almost certainly kill itself.

We have the bad AIXI model above - it will survive for a long time, but is trapped in a bad epistemic state.

What would be ideal would be a way of establishing the minimal required exploration rate.
