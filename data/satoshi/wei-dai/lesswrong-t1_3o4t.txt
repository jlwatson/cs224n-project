The sensation of pain "in and of itself" has no moral disvalue. What matters is "damage". Usually things which cause pain also go some way towards causing injury, and injury prevents an agent from achieving the things it could otherwise have done. Pain is also 'coercive' in the sense that it stops a person in their tracks (whatever they were trying to do, now all they can do is moan and writhe). Effectively it's a form of physical restraint.

Then there are a whole bunch of second-order effects. E.g. hurting people is bad because it creates a climate where disputes are resolved by physical violence.

Perhaps these considerations don't help us to distinguish between "actual pain" and "the appearance of pain", but we don't need to - what's important is distinguishing "the appearance of pain when it has moral disvalue" and "the appearance of pain when it doesn't".
