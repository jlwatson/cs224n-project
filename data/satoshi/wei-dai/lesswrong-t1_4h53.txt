Sure, except he doesn't make any arguments for his position. He just says:

&gt; Normative disputes, e.g. between theories of wellbeing, are surely more substantive than is allowed for by this account.

I don't think normative debates are *always* "merely verbal". I just think they are very often 'merely verbal', and that there are multiple concepts of normativity in use. Chappel and I, for example, seem to have [different intuitions](http://www.philosophyetc.net/2011/06/normativity-objection-to-metaethical.html) (see comments) about what normativity amounts to.
