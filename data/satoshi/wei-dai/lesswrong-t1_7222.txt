To answer your second sentence on, one consideration is that it is highly questionable whether scanning and uploading is even possible in any practical sense, as [people who actually work with brain preservation on a daily basis and would *love* to be able to extract state from the preserved material](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/dm3/pz_myers_on_the_infeasibility_of_whole_brain/) seem to consider the matter: It's "possible" philosophically, but not at all practically. This suggests that it's low enough feasibility at present that even paying serious attention to it may be a waste of time of the "Pascal's scam" form described in the linked post (whether the word "scam" is fair or not).
