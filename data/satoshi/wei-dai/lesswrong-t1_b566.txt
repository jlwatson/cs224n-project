I'd be somewhat worried about this if I were selling jefftk.com or something, but "wei" and "dai" without tones could mean many things.  I don't remember much of my Chinese, but looking at a dictionary I see:

    wei: place, seat, not, because, become, tiny, tail, yes, taste
    dai: doctor, belt, dynasty, stay, wait, going to, bag, wear, dangerous, lazy

Now, not all of these combinations will mean what they look like they might mean, but there are a lot of reasonable things "wei dai" could mean aside from a person's name.

(It also looks like "wei dai" can mean "grave danger".)
