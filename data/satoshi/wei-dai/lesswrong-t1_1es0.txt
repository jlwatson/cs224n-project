I want to ask, why are people mean in the first place? I think before we try to "fix" some behavior we should make sure we understand it first. Otherwise we might be like the social reformers who try to fix "broken" institutions without understanding their reasons for existing.

To a first approximation, meanness seems to be the deliberate cause of [offense](http://lesswrong.com/lw/13s/the_nature_of_offense/). (Although I wonder if I'm suffering from the [man-with-a-hammer syndrome](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1jf/manwithahammer_syndrome/) here.) Anyone have other ideas?
