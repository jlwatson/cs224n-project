If people haven't you should read the [OKtrends](http://blog.okcupid.com/) blog, especially about what [makes a good picture](http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/dont-be-ugly-by-accident/) (good quality camera etc).

Also a bit about what people are looking for dating wise would be useful.  Generally that is too dull to put in the profile itself, but required for advice I think.

My profile is currently moth-balled, and not really designed to be attractive (I did get accused of being narcissus, which put me off making it more attractive). I found it horrendously addictive interacting with people and looking at the breadth of humanity and their hopes and dreams.

If not people are nosy, I will divulge my okc identity via private message. I am also quite happy to give out awards, if people want them. Or just look at your visitor list for the guy with the round blue sunglasses on.
