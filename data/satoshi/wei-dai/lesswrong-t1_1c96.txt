What are the implications to FAI theory of Robin's claim that most of what we do is really [status-seeking](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/12/hiding-status-grubbing.html)?  If an FAI were to try to extract or extrapolate our values, would it mostly end up with "status" as the answer and see our detailed interests, such as charity or curiosity about decision theory, as mere instrumental values?
