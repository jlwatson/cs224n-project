By "true" do you mean that the physical universe semantically entails the sentence, or that the sentence is a semantic tautology of second-order logic?  I'm assuming the latter, since the former case is what I was assuming when I gave my Tarski reply.

So... I'm pretty sure you can represent a set's semantic entailment of a Henkin interpretation of a second-order sentence in a first-order set theory.  I'm less sure that you can represent entailment of a second-order sentence inside a second-order set theory, but I'm having trouble seeing why you *wouldn't* be able to do that.  I also think that second-order set theories are supposed to be finitely axiomatizable, though I could be wrong about this.  But then I'm not *quite* sure why we don't get into Tarskian trouble.

Let ST be the finite axiomatization of a second-order set theory.  Then in second-order logic, why doesn't the sentence (ST-&gt;"All sets: Set entails S") form a truth predicate for S?  My guess is that there's just no theorem which says, "X is *true* (entailed by the mathematical universal set / model we're currently operating inside) iff 'X' is entailed by all sets (inside the current model)".

If this is so, then it looks to me like for any given set of axioms corresponding to a second-order set theory, second-order logic can represent the idea of a device that outputs sentences which are semantically entailed by every individual set *inside* that theory.  So the new answer would be that you are welcome to hypothesize that a device prints out truths of second-order logic, for any given background second-order set theory which provides a universe of models against which those sentences are judged universally semantically true.

In which case the indefinite extensibility gets packed into the choice of set theory that we think this device is judging second-order validity for, if I haven't dropped the bucket somewhere along the way.
