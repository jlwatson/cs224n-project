Why? If you can end up on either end of a long line segment, then you have a chance of winning a lot or losing a lot. But you shouldn't be risk averse with your utility - risk aversion should already be included. So "towards the middle" is no better in expectation than "right end or left end".

Maybe you're thinking we shouldn't be maximising expected utility? I'm actually quite sympathetic to that view...

And with complex real world valuations (eg anything with a diminishing marginal utility), then any Pareto line segments are likely to be short.
