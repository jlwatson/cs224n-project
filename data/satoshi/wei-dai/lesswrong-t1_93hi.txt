I think this is especially relevant in philosophy and philosophical FAI problems, where, since there aren't any equivalent of mathematical proofs, multiple independent lines of argument seem to be the only way to develop high confidence in some proposed solution. Unfortunately in practice there probably won't be enough time to do this, and we'll be lucky if for each problem we can even come up with one solution that don't look obviously wrong.
