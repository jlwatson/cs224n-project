Well, apart from the fact that it looked like people [wanted](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1mc/normal_cryonics/1ikk) me to write it, I'm personally irritated by the background assumption of consequentialism on this site, especially since it usually seems to come from incomprehension more than anything else.  People phrasing things more neutrally, or at least knowing exactly what it is they're discarding, would be nice for me.
