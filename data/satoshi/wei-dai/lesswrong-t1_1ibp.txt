But post-FAI, how does anyone except the FAI have anything to offer? Neither anything to offer, nor anything to threaten with. The FAI decides all, does all, rules all. The question is, how _should_ it rule? Since no creature besides the FAI has anything to offer, weighting is out of the equation, and every present, past, and potential creature's utilities should count the same.
