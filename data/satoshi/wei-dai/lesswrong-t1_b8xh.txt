Since I'm not very familiar with the Bible, I had to look up the quote in Wikipedia (the full quote being "But when you do merciful deeds, donâ€™t let your left hand know what your right hand does"), and even there it suggests multiple possible interpretations for Matthew 6:3. Can you spell out what you think the quote means, and why this study validates it?
