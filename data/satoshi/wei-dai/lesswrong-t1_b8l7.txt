I'm not convinced that evolution is that good a metaphor for this. But since there are so few good metaphors or ideas anyway, lets go with it.

Evolution hasn't produced a satisfactory general intelligence in the AIXI form. As far as I can tell, all the non-anthropomorphic measures of intelligence ranks humans as not particularly high. So humans are poor general intelligences in any objective sense we can measure it.

Your point is that humans are extremely successful intelligences, which is valid. It seems that we can certainly get great performance out of some general intelligence ability. I see that as "a minimum of understanding and planning go a long way". And note that it took human society a long time to raise us to the level of power we have now; the additive nature of human intelligence (building on the past) was key there.

Addressed the more general point in the model added to the top post.
