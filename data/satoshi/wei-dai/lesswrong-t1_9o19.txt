Do you agree or disagree or remain neutral on my arguments for why we should expect that 'hard' philosophical problems aren't *really* hard in the way that protein structure prediction is hard?  In other words, we should expect the *real actual answers* to be things that fit on a page or less, once all confusion is dispelled?  It seems to me that this is a key branch point in where we might disagree here.
