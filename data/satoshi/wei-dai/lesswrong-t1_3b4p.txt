To theorize a bit, all of us probably have evolved, unconscious heuristics for what kind of work we are highly motivated to do (which can vary from individual to individual), and when a certain piece of work satisfies one or more of these heuristics, it "doesn't feel like work". Ideally, evolution would have tuned these heuristics so that we always feel motivated to do the kind of work that we rationally *should* do, but of course evolution hasn't worked quickly enough for that to be the case for us.

The above seems fairly obvious, but the details of some of these heuristics are still puzzling. For example, why does payment or other form of obligation reduce motivation?
