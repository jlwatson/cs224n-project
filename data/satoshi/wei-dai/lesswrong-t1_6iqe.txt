Luke, Stuart, and anyone else trying to convince AI researchers to be more cautious, can we please stop citing the orthogonality thesis? I just don't see what the point is, if no AI researcher actually holds its denial, or if all they have to do to blunt the force of your argument is take one step back and start talking about possibility in practice instead of in theory.
