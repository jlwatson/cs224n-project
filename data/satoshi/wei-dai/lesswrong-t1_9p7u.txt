&gt;Jonah's impression is that Weiner had strong views on the subject, doesn't seem to have updated much in response to incoming evidence

My [impression](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i5w/norbert_wiener_on_automation_and_unemployment/9p7r) is Jonah may have gotten wrong impressions of Wiener's views. I also didn't see where Jonah talked about Wiener not having updated much in response to incoming evidence. (What evidence?) Did you see that in his [post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i5w/norbert_wiener_on_automation_and_unemployment/), or did he write about it elsewhere?
