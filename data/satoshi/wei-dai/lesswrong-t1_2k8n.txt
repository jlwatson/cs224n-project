&gt;Have you noticed that many (most?) commenters/voters seem to disagree with your estimate? 

Yes. Of course, there's a selection effect here - the people on LW are more likely to assign a high probability to the proposition that Eliezer will build a Friendly AI (whether or not there's epistemic reason to do so). 

The people outside of LW who I talk to on a regular basis have an estimate in line with my own. I trust these people's judgment more than I trust LW posters judgment simply because I have much more information about their positive track records for making accurate real world judgments than I do for the people on LW. 

&gt;To me that implies that Eliezer could disagree with your estimate even after seriously considering your arguments, so I don't think his "persisting in holding his beliefs" offers much evidence for your position that Eliezer exhibited "unwillingness to seriously consider the possibility that he's vastly overestimated his chances of building a Friendly AI".

Yes, so I agree that in *your* epistemological state you should feel this way. I'm explaining why in *my* epistemological state I feel the way I do.
