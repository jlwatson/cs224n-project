&gt; It seems to me that vagueness is different from having competing definitions (e.g., AIXI's notion of utility function vs UDT's) that may turn out to be wrong.

AIXI's utility function is useless, the fact that it can be called "utility function" notwithstanding. UDT's utility function is not defined formally (its meaning depends on "math intuition"). For any real-world application of a utility function, we don't have a formal notion of its domain. These definitions are somewhat vague, even if not hopelessly so. They *are* hopelessly vague for the purpose of building a FAI.
