&gt;I'm not actually sure exactly what "signaling" meansâ€”which is arguably reason enough for us not to use it.

One person or even a few people not understanding some term isn't a good enough reason for the rest of us to stop using it. It might be a good reason for someone to write a tutorial about it though... if Yvain hadn't already [written one](http://lesswrong.com/lw/did/what_is_signaling_really/).
