I think that literary fiction is the best available source of social insight very regularly.  I'm particularly partial to Russian Opera as the training wheels version of this actually.  Science Fiction, in my experience, is much much less frequently a source of valuable insight, though Vinge's Cookie Monster provided one.  

By the way, is this post obvious to most people?  I can't tell if it would be obvious to most readers or not.
