If you want to extract the master because it affects the values of the slave, then you'd also have to extract the rest of the universe because the master reacts to it. I think drawing a circle around just the creature's brain and saying all the preferences are there is a [modern?] human notion. (and perhaps incorrect, even for looking at humans.)

We need our environment, especially other humans, to form our preferences in the first place.
