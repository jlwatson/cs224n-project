Don't you think that others working on Sleeping Beauty, absent-minded driver, Parfit's hitchhiker etc. helped pave the way for UDT by providing a *list of questions* for UDT to answer?

I mean, I'm not saying that one shouldn't try to do better than the people who worked on all these problems (I might even be tempted to agree with what Jeffreyssai might say on the subject, though I expect you wouldn't go that far) but it seems like even in a reasonably efficient way to approach the problem, "searching under the streetlight" by playing with some crisply formulated problems may help pave the way to deeper answers.

(In particular, I think that MIRI's current research strategy is not-completely-crazy in starting under the streetlight in various respects; e.g., I'd be rather surprised if the modal agent formulation turned out to be useful *as is* for FAI, but I *do* think there's a reasonable chance that it will help pave the way to deeper insights; and I agree with you that it may well turn out that probability is the *wrong* tool for handling logical uncertainty, but I feel that *trying* to use probability and seeing what results we can get is an obviously useful thing to do; and I think that it's sufficiently likely that diagonalization problems will bite a wide range of attempts to handle logical uncertainty that I think working on workarounds to diagonalization makes sense to do in parallel with work on logical uncertainty, rather than trying to solve logical uncertainty first.)
