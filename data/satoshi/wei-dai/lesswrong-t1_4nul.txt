&gt; Consider an analogy with empirical judgements. Suppose someone says "Earth is flat." Are they stating a proposition about the way the world is, or just expressing that they have a certain belief? If it's the latter, then they can't be wrong (assuming they're not deliberately lying).

They can be wrong if they should on reflection change this belief.
