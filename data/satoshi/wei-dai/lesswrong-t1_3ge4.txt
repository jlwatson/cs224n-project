&gt; I think Eliezer's meta-ethics is wrong because it's possible that we live in a world where Eliezer's "right" doesn't actually designate anything. 

In what way? Since the idea hasn't been given much technical clarity, even if it moves conceptual understanding a long way, it's hard for me to imagine how one can arrive at confidence in a strong statement like that.
