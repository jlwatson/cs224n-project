&gt; There's no reason for Omega to kill me in the winning outcome...

Omega's a bastard.  So what?

&gt; Well, I'm not as altruistic as you are. 

WHAT?  Are you honestly sure you're THAT not as altruistic as I am?

&gt; But there must be some positive X such that even you wouldn't take a trustworthy X probability of that reward and a 1-X probability of death, over the status quo, right?

There's the problem of whether the scenario I described which involves a "forever" and "over all space" actually has infinite utility compared to increments in my own life which even if I would otherwise live forever would be over an infinitesimal fraction of all space, but if we fix that with a rather smaller prize that I would still accept, then yes of course.

&gt; Suppose you've drawn enough cards to win this prize, what new prize can Omega offer you to entice you to draw another card?

Heal this Reality plus another three?
