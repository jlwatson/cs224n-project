The non-negligible chance of waking up to a personal hell-world (including, partial+failed revivification) is the main non-akratic reason I'm not signed up for cryonics. I currently think AGI is coming sooner than WBE, but if WBE starts pulling ahead then I would be even *more* disinclined to sign up for cryonics.

Wei, do you know of any arguments better than XiXiDu's that a failed attempt at FAI could very well be worse than extinction?
