I don't understand what you or Yvain mean by "values" anymore, but perhaps we can make some progress without focusing on the word.

To borrow Eliezer's examples, do you think you would discard the value of [boredom](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xr/in_praise_of_boredom/) given enough time to reflect? Would you discard the desire to [not be optimized too hard](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xb/free_to_optimize/) by an outside agent? Would you discard sympathy for other conscious humans? Complexity of value is not merely about complexity of taste buds. The things that we deeply care for, and wish to continue caring for, are complex as well.

As for those people who profess to value simplicity of values, I'm willing to bite the bullet and claim that most of them wouldn't agree to lose the complex stuff listed in the previous paragraph.
