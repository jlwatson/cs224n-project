As I see it, your proposed classification scheme perpetuates the notion that Intelligence augmentation and machine intelligence are alternatives to each other.  If you see them as complementary, using the distinction between them as the basis of a classification scheme makes little sense.  They *are* complementary - and are not really alternatives.
 
Yes, it would be fun if there was some kind of viable intelligence augmentation-only way forwards - but that idea just seems delusional to me.  There's no such path.  Convergence means nanotech and robotics converge. It also means that intelligence augmentation and machine intelligence converge.
