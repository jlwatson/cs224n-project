That's the probability statement in his post. He didn't mention the probability of SIAI's success, and hasn't previously when I've emailed him or asked in public forums, nor has he at any point in time that I've heard. Shortly after I asked, he posted [When (Not) To Use Probabilities](http://lesswrong.com/lw/sg/when_not_to_use_probabilities/).
