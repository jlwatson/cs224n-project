&gt; Yes, and that's enough for rational decision making.

I agree that you can turn the handle on a particular piece of mathematics that resembles decisionmaking, but some part of me says that you're just playing a game with yourself: you decide that everything exists, then you put a prior over everything, then you act to maximize your utility, weighted by that prior. It is certainly a blow to one's intuition that one can only salvage the ability to act by playing a game of make-believe that some sections of "everything" are "less real" than others, where your real-ness prior is something you had to make up anyway. 

Others also think that I am just slow on the uptake of this idea. But to me the idea that reality is not fixed but relative to what real-ness prior you decide to pick is extremely ugly. It would mean that the utility of technology to achieve things is merely a shared delusion, that if a theist chose a real-ness prior that assigned high real-ness only to universes where a theistic god existed then he would be correct to pray, etc. Effectively you're saying that the postmodernists were right after all. 

Now, the fact that I have a negative emotional reaction to this proposal doesn't make it less true, of course.
