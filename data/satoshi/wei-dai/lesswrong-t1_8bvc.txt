Order-dependence and butterfly effects - knew about this and had it in mind when I wrote CEV, I *think* it should be in the text.

Counterfactual Mugging - check, I don't *think* I was calling TDT a complete solution before then but the Counterfactual Mugging was a class of possibilities I hadn't considered.  (It does seem related to Parfit's Hitchhiker which I knew was a problem.)

Solomonoff Induction - again, I think you may be overestimating how much weight I put on that in the first place.  It's not a workable AI answer for at least two obvious reasons I'm pretty sure I knew about from almost-day-one, (a) it's uncomputable and (b) it can't handle utility functions over the environment.  However, your particular contributions about halting-oracles-shouldn't-be-unimaginable did indeed influence me in toward my current notion of second-order logical natural induction over possible models of axioms in which you could be embedded.  Albeit I stand by my old reply that Solomonoff Induction would encompass any computable predictions or learning you could do about halting oracles in the environment.  (The problem of porting yourself onto *any* environmental object is something I already knew AIXI would fail at.)
