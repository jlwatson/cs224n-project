It looks like in this discussion you assume that switching to "TDT" (it's highly uncertain what this means) immediately gives the decision to cooperate in "true PD". I don't see why it should be so. Summarizing [my](http://lesswrong.com/lw/15m/towards_a_new_decision_theory/11lt) [previous](http://lesswrong.com/lw/15m/towards_a_new_decision_theory/11lu) [comments](http://lesswrong.com/lw/15m/towards_a_new_decision_theory/11lv), exactly what the players know about each other, exactly in what way they know it, may make their decisions go either way. That the players switch from CDT to some kind of more timeless decision theory doesn't determine the answer to be "cooperate", it merely opens up the possibility that previously was decreed irrational, and I suspect that what's important in the new setting for making the decision go either way isn't captured properly in the problem statement of "true PD". 

Also, the way you treat "agents with TDT" seems more appropriate for "agents with Cooperator prefix" from cousin_it's [Formalizing PD](http://lesswrong.com/lw/do/reformalizing_pd/). And this is a simplified thing far removed from a complete decision theory, although a [step in the right direction](http://lesswrong.com/lw/do/reformalizing_pd/aj4).
