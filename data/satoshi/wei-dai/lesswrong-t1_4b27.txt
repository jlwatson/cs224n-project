&gt;BTW, in this line of thinking, there's nothing really special or mysterious about consciousness. It's just a mind or a part of a mind with verbal abilities.

Huh? I am conscious of a lot of things that don't involve words. In fact, words are a very small part of my awareness, except when I'm actually using them, e.g. composing a comment like this one. They're a major way of communicating one's state of mind to someone else, but to identify consciousness with that facility would be like mistaking a computer screen for the computer.

I suppose that might change if one were to practice one of those meditation exercises in which one deliberately labels every moment of experience; but I don't know why one would want to do that.
