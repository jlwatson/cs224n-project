I do accept that 'wants' imply 'oughts'. It's an oversimplification, but the thought is that statements such as 

* X's wanting that X eat an apple implies (many other things being equal) that X ought to eat an apple.

are intuitively plausible. If wanting carries no implications for what one ought to do, I don't see how motivation can get off the ground.

Now, if we have 

1) wanting that P implies one ought to do Q, 

 and

2) being in physical state ABC implies wanting that P

then, by transitivity of implication, we get

3) being in physical state ABC implies one ought to do Q

And this is just the kind of implication I'm trying to show is problematic.
