I greatly appreciate the response to my post, particularly the highly thoughtful responses of Luke (original post), [Eliezer](http://lesswrong.com/lw/cze/reply_to_holden_on_tool_ai/), and many commenters.

**Broad response to Luke's and Eliezer's points:**

As I see it, there are a few possible visions of SI's mission:

* M1. SI is attempting to create a team to build a "Friendly" AGI.
* M2. SI is developing "Friendliness theory," which addresses how to develop a provably safe/useful/benign utility function without needing iterative/experimental development; this theory could be integrated into an AGI developed by another team, in order to ensure that its actions are beneficial.
* M3. SI is broadly committed to reducing AGI-related risks, and work on whatever will work toward that goal, including potentially M1 and M2.

My view is that **the broader SI's mission, the higher the bar should be for the overall impressiveness of the organization and team.** An organization with a very narrow, specific mission - such as "analyzing how to develop a provably safe/useful/benign utility function without needing iterative/experimental development" - can, relatively easily, establish which other organizations (if any) are trying to provide what it does and what the relative qualifications are; it can set clear expectations for deliverables over time and be held accountable to them; its actions and outputs are relatively easy to criticize and debate. By contrast, an organization with broader aims and less clearly relevant deliverables - such as "broadly aiming to reduce risks from AGI, with activities currently focused on community-building" - is giving a donor (or evaluator) less to go on in terms of what the space looks like, what the specific qualifications are and what the specific deliverables are. In this case it becomes more important that a donor be highly confident in the exceptional effectiveness of the organization and team as a whole.

Many of the responses to my criticisms (points #1 and #4 in [Eliezer's response](http://lesswrong.com/lw/cze/reply_to_holden_on_tool_ai/); "SI's mission assumes a scenario that is far less conjunctive than it initially appears" and "SI's goals and activities" section of Luke's response) correctly point out that they have less force, *as criticisms*, when one views SI's mission as relatively broad. However, I believe that evaluating SI by a broader mission raises the burden of affirmative arguments for SI's impressiveness. The primary such arguments I see in the responses are in Luke's list:

&gt; (1) The Sequences, the best tool I know for creating aspiring rationalists, (2) Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, a surprisingly successful tool for grabbing the attention of mathematicians and computer scientists around the world, and (3) the Singularity Summit, a mainstream-aimed conference that brings in people who end up making significant contributions to the movement â€” e.g. Tomer Kagan (an SI donor and board member) and David Chalmers (author of The Singularity: A Philosophical Analysis and The Singularity: A Reply).

I've been a consumer of all three of these, and while I've found them enjoyable, I don't find them sufficient for the purpose at hand. Others may reach a different conclusion. And of course, I continue to follow SI's progress, as I understand that it may submit more impressive achievements in the future.

Both Luke and Eliezer seem to disagree with the basic approach I'm taking here. They seem to believe that it is sufficient to establish that (a) AGI risk is an overwhelmingly important issue and that (b) SI compares favorably to other organizations that explicitly focus on this issue. For my part, I (a) disagree with the statement: "the loss in expected value resulting from an existential catastrophe is so enormous that the objective of reducing existential risks should be a dominant consideration whenever we act out of an impersonal concern for humankind as a whole"; (b) do not find Luke's argument that AI, specifically, is the most important existential risk to be compelling (it discusses only how beneficial it would be to address the issue well, not how likely a donor is to be able to help do so); (c) believe it is appropriate to compare the overall organizational impressiveness of the Singularity Institute to that of all other donation-soliciting organizations, not just to that of other existential-risk- or AGI-focused organizations. I would guess that these disagreements, particularly (a) and (c), come down to relatively deep worldview differences (related to the debate over "Pascal's Mugging") that I will probably write more about in the future.

**On tool AI:**

Most of my disagreements with SI representatives seem to be over how broad a mission is appropriate for SI, and how high a standard SI as an organization should be held to. However, the debate over "tool AI" is different, with both sides making relatively strong claims. Here SI is putting forth a specific point as an underappreciated insight and thus as a potential contribution/accomplishment; my view is that SI's suggested approach to AGI development is more dangerous than the "traditional" approach to software development, and thus that SI is advocating for an approach that would worsen risks from AGI.

My latest thoughts on this disagreement were posted separately in a [comment response to Eliezer's post on the subject](http://lesswrong.com/lw/cze/reply_to_holden_on_tool_ai/74l0).

**A few smaller points:**

* I disagree with Luke's claim that " objection #1 punts to objection #2." Objection #2 (regarding "tool AI") points out one possible approach to AGI that I believe is both consonant with traditional software development and significantly safer than the approach advocated by SI. But even if the "tool AI" approach is not in fact safer, there may be safer approaches that SI hasn't thought of. SI does not just emphasize the general problem that AGI may be dangerous (something that I believe is a fairly common view), but emphasizes a particular approach to AGI safety, one that seems to me to be highly dangerous. If SI's approach is dangerous relative to other approaches that others are taking/advocating, or even approaches that have yet to be developed (and will be enabled by future tools and progress on AGI), this is a problem for SI.
* Luke states that rationality is "only a ceteris paribus predictor of success" and that it is a "weak one." I wish to register that I believe rationality is a strong (though not perfect) predictor of success, within the population of people who are as privileged (in terms of having basic needs met, access to education, etc.) as most SI supporters/advocates/representatives. So while I understand that success is not part of the *definition* of rationality, I stand by my statement that it is "the best evidence of superior general rationality (or of insight into it)."
* Regarding donor-advised funds: opening an account with Vanguard, Schwab or Fidelity is a simple process, and I doubt any of these institutions would overrule a recommendation to donate to an organization such as SI (in any case, this is easily testable).
