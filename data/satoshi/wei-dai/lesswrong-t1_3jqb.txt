&gt; If we consider a human as a group of agents with different values

Things like this is why it looks like a good idea to me to taboo "values". Human includes many heuristics that together add up to what counts as an "agent". Separate aspects/parts of a human include fewer heuristics, which makes these parts less like agents, and "values" for these parts become even less defined than for the whole. 

So "human as group of agents with different values" translates as "human as a collection of parts with different structure", which sounds far less explanatory (as it should).
