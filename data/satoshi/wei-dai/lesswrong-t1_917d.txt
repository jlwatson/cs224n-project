Fair question. On this forum narrow AI = not really intelligent and benign, while general AI = potentially smarter than humans, ready to FOOM and dangerous. My point was that Watson might be some day providing an example of a smarter-than-human but benign (not FOOMable) AI, depending on how it is designed.
