Uncertainty over my future financial situation seems a good reason for me to postpone giving until later. Consider a simple two period model in which next period my income will be zero (with small probability), or $100,000.  In a better world I could purchase insurance to fully insure against this risk, but such income insurance doesn't exist.  Now assume if I knew my income would be zero next period my optimal lifetime total charitable donation would be zero, but positive else-wise.  It might be optimal for me to wait to observe my income next period before making any donations.
