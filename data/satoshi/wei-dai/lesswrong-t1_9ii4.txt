Because sometimes the impossible can be done, and I don't know how to estimate the probability of that.  What would you have estimated in advance, without knowing the result, was the chance of success for the AI-Box Experiment?  How about if I told you that I was going to write the most popular Harry Potter fanfiction in the world and use it to recruit International Mathematical Olympiad medalists?  There may be true impossibilities in this world.  Eternal life may be one such, if the character of physical law is what is it appears to be, to our sorrow.  I do not think that FAI is one of those.  So I am going to try.  We can work out what the probability of success was after we have succeeded.  The chance which is gained is not gained by turning away or by despair, but by continuing to engage with and attack the problem, watching for opportunities and constantly advancing.

If you don't believe me about that aspect of heroic epistemology, feel free not to believe me about not multiplying small probabilities either.
