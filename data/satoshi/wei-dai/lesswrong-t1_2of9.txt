&gt; If you really think censorship is bad even by Eliezer's values, I suggest withdrawing your threat and just try to convince him of that using rational arguments.

I do not expect that (non-costly signalling by someone who does not have significant status) to work any more than threats would. A better suggestion would be to forget raw threats and consider what other alternatives wfg has available by which he could deploy an equivalent amount of power that would have the desired influence. Eliezer moved the game from one of persuasion (you should not talk about this) to one about power and enforcement (public humiliation, censorship and threats). You don't take a pen to a gun fight.
