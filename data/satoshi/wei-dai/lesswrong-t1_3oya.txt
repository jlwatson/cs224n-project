The main cause of this problem seems institutional: the people who instruct us are also the people who evaluate us and assign us grades which determine which schools we get into and such. From an individual perspective, other than some minor missed optimizations (like not admitting ignorance to tutors who don't grade you, out of habit), it looks like a conflict between instrumental and epistemic rationality.
