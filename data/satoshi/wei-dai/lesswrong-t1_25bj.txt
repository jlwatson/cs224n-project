&gt;If the two planets aren't revolving around each other, wouldn't gravity pull them together?

Gravity would pull, yes, but the rotation of a body also distorts space in such a way to produce another effect you have to consider.

**ETA:** Look at a similar scenario.  Same as the one I proposed, but you always see the same portion of the other planet.  How do you know how fast the two planets are revolving around each other?  Isn't this the same as asking how fast the entire universe is rotating?
