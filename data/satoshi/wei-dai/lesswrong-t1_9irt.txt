&gt; For example I'm assuming that you'd ask the AI to answer questions like "What would Eliezer conclude about second-order logic after thinking undisturbed about it for 100 years?" but maybe you have something else in mind?)

The thought is much more bite-sized and tractable questions to work with less individually capable systems (with shorter time horizons, etc) like: "find a machine-checkable proof of this lemma" or "I am going to read one of these 10 papers to try to shed light on my problem using random selection, score each with the predicted rating I will give the paper's usefulness after reading it." I discussed this in a presentation at the FHI (focused on WBE, where the issue of unbalanced abilities relative to humans does not apply), and the concepts will be discussed in Nick's book.
