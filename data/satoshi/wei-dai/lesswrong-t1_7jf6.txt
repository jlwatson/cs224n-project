&gt; Do you think, in retrospect, it might have been better to give an answer like "I doubt that there are enough people in reality who fit your description for there to be an established term for the category." instead of "fictional"?

Absolutely not. [Nsheppard's](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9c/mandatory_secret_identities/7j3n) is perhaps the most salient comment in the entire thread, closely followed by [genius's follow up](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9c/mandatory_secret_identities/7j6r). This site would be a worse place if it was not made. I would of course not have expressed my agreement with nsheppard if I had predicted that it would receive a hostile response but would most certainly have defended nsheppard if the 'non-sequitur' accusations were then directly leveled at him instead of me.

(Your answer is a good one too, and I would have liked to see that comment made *in addition to* the 'fictional' comment.)

I note that nsheppard's "fictional" answer remains at +5 at the time of this comment and this is *despite* it being subjected to a tantrum which can usually be expected to significantly lower the rating. This indicates that my continued endorsement of his reply is actually in line with consensus.

There are other things I would of course write differently in retrospect, and participants who I have learned to interact with differently (if at all) in the future---but the 'fictional' comment is most definitely not the place at which I would intervene to counterfactually change the past if I could.

If you'll pardon me while I reciprocate with a similar question, why did you think it was a good idea to ask me the quoted question? By my estimation even casually following my comments for a month would be enough to predict with significant confidence that that kind of reply to a rhetorical question is something that I would reflectively endorse myself making or upvote from others. Most people could probably predict that even just having read the context in this thread. Of *course* I am going to disagree.

The aforementioned entirely predictable disagreement doesn't mean that you can't assert your position but it does mean that if you ask a *direct question* then my possible responses are [ignore](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1gg/agree_retort_or_ignore_a_post_from_the_future/) or retort. (Or, of course, lie, obfuscate or [fog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertiveness#Fogging) but let's focus on the direct responses.) I know you don't like (or, I suppose, your past self didn't like) 'ignore' and replying with disagreement just amounts to extending the exact same pointless side-track that you wanted to avoid.

So I ask you, is the problem that you didn't think it through or that my preferences regarding how questions like that should be responded to are insufficiently transparent? And this is a surprisingly sincere question. One of the many posts that I'd like to write but only have the rudimentary notes prepared for actually is "On Rhetorical Questions and the Response Thereto" (although I think I'd come up with a better name). And yes, it would include a section endorsing the kind of response you suggest here, too.
