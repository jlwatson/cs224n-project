I actually inserted mine into my comment above: 

&gt;Roughly speaking, I would say that together, all the evidence against Knox and Sollecito, of which the bra clasp and knife are for me the overwhelming majority (everything else being near-negligible), shifted P(guilt) upward by about an order of magnitude -- a factor of 10, from a prior somewhere between 0.0001 and 0.001 to a posterior somewhere between 0.001 and 0.01. The Conti-Vecchiotti report cuts that down a bit, though not necessarily hugely, since their findings were pretty much what I already expected them to be.
