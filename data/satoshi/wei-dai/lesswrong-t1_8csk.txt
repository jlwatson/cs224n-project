&gt;not right to just implicitly assume that they are the same thing.

Yes, good point. I was just listing words that people tend to throw around for that sort of problem. "awesome" is likewise not *necessarily*  "good". I wonder how I might make that clearer...

&gt;If we take an outcome to be a world history, then "being turned into a whale for a day" isn't an outcome.

Thanks for pointing this out. I forgot to substantiate on that. I take "turned into a whale for a day" to be referring to the probability distribution over total world histories consistent with current observations and with the turned-into-a-whale-on-this-day constraint.

Maybe I should have explained what I was doing... I hope no one gets too confused.

&gt;I'm having trouble reconciling this

"Awesomeness" is IMO the simplest effective pointer to morality that we currently have, but that morality is still inconsistent and dynamic. I take the "moral philosophy" problem to be working out in explicit detail what exactly is awesome and what isn't, from our current position in morality-space, with all its meta-intuitions. I think this problem is incredibly hard to solve completely, but most people can do better than usual by just using "awesomeness". I hope this makes that clearer?

&gt;VNM, or just the concept of utility function, implies consequentialism

In some degenerate sense, yes, but you can easily think up a utility function that cares what rules you followed in coming to a decision, which is generally not considered "consequentialism". It is after all part of the world history and therefor available to the utility function.

We may have reached the point where we are looking at the problem in more detail than "consequentialism" is good for. We may need a new word to distinguish mere VNM from rules-don't-matter type stuff.
