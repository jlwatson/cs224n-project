One argument in favor of this being relevant specifically to FAI is that evolution kludged up us, so there is no strong reason to think that AGI projects with an incomplete understanding of the problem space will eventually kludge up an AGI that is able to solve these problems itself and successfully navigate an intelligence explosion -- and then paperclip the universe, since the incomplete understanding of the human researchers creating the seed AI wouldn't suffice for giving the seed AI stable goals. I.e., solving this in some way looks *probably necessary* for reaching AI safety at all, but only *possibly helpful* for AI capability.

I'm not *entirely* unworried about that concern, but I'm less worried about it than about making AGI more interesting by doing interesting in-principle work on it, and I currently feel that even the latter danger is outweighed by the danger of not tackling the object-level problems early enough to actually make progress before it's too late.
