Similar considerations apply to possible singleton-ish AGIs that might be architecturally constrained to varying levels of efficiency in optimization, e.g. some decision theories might coordinate poorly and so waste the cosmic commons. Thus optimizing for an AGI's mere friendliness to existent humans could easily be setting much too low a bar, at least for perspectives and policies that include a total utilitarian bentâ€”something much closer to "ideal" would instead have to be the target.
