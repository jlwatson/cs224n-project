I spent quite a few hours going through Peterson's 2008 book (online copy available [here](https://www.msb.se/Upload/Om%20MSB/Forskning/Projektrapporter/Peterson_artiklar/Non-Bayesian%20Decision%20Theory.pdf)) to see if there were any interesting ideas, and found the time largely wasted. (This was my initial intuition, but I thought I'd take a closer look since Luke emailed me directly to ask me to comment.) It would take even more time to write up a good critique, so I'll just point out the most glaring problem: Peterson's proposal for how to derive a utility function from one's subjective uncertainty about one's own choices, as illustrated in this example:

&gt;This means that if the probability that you choose salmon is 2/3, and the probability
that you choose tuna is 1/3, then your utility of salmon is twice as high as that
of tuna.

What if we apply this idea to the choice between $20 and $30?

&gt;Let us now return to the problem of perfect discrimination mentioned above.
As explained by Luce, the problem is that â€˜the [utility] scale is defined only over
a set having no pairwise perfect discriminations, which is probably only a small
portion of any dimension we might wish to scale That is, the problem lies in the
assumption that p(x  &gt; y) != 0,1 for all x,y in B. After all, this condition is rather
unlikely to be satisfied, because most agents know for sure that they prefer $40 to
$20, and $30 to $20, etc.

Peterson tries to solve this problem in section 5.3, but his solution makes no sense. From page 90:

&gt;Suppose, for example,
that I wish to determine my utility of $20, $30, and $40, respectively. In this case,
the non-perfect object can be a photo of my beloved cat Carla, who died when I was
fourteen. If offered a choice between $20 and the photo, the probability is 1/4 that I
would choose the money; if offered a choice between $30 and the photo, the probability
is 2/4 that I would choose the money; and if offered a choice between $40 and
the photo, the probability is 3/4 that I would choose the money. This information is
sufficient for constructing a single ratio scale for all four objects. Here is how to do
it: The point of departure is the three local scales, which have one common element,
the photo of Carla. The utility of the photo is the same in all three pairwise choices.
Let u(photo) = 1. Then the utility of money is calculated by calibrating the three
local scales such that u(photo) = 1 in all of them.

So we end up with u($20)=1/3, u($30)=u(photo)=1, u($40)=3. But this utility function now implies that given a choice between $20 and $30, you'd choose $20 with probability 1/4, and $30 with probability 3/4, contradicting the initial assumption that you'd choose $30 with certainty. I have no idea how Peterson failed to notice this.
