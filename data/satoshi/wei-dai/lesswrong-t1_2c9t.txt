I don't think I understood that fully, but there seems to be a problem with your theory.  The human gets to start in the epistemically advantaged position of knowing that the game is based on a sequence of busy beavers and knowing that they are a very fast growing function.  AIXI is prevent from knowing this information and has to start as if from a blank canvas.  The reason we use a Occamian prior for AIXI is because we refuse to tailor it to a specific environment, if your logic is sound, then yes, it does do worse when it is dropped into an environment where it is paired with a human with an epistemic advantage, but it would beat the human across the space of possible worlds.

Another problem you seem to have is to assume that the only hypothesis in the entire set that gives *useful* predictions is the hypothesis which is, in fact, correct.  There are plenty of other function which correctly predict arbitrarily large numbers of 1's, with much less complexity, which can give the overall probability weighting that AIXI is using a *usefully correct* model of its universe, if not a fully correct one.
