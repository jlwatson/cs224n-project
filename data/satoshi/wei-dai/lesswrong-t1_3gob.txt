The point is not that they'll be different, but that mistakes will be made, making the result not quite right, or more likely not right at all. So on the early stage, one must be very careful, develop a reliable theory of how to proceed instead of just doing stuff at random, or rather according to current human heuristics. 

Extended amount of reflection looks like one least invasive self-improvement technique, something that's expected to make you more reliably right, especially if you're given opportunity to decide how the process is to be set up. This could get us to the next stage, and so on. More invasive heuristics can prove too disruptive, wrong in unexpected and poorly-understood ways, so that one won't be able to expect the right outcome without close oversight from a moral judgment, which we don't have in any technically strong enough form as of yet.
