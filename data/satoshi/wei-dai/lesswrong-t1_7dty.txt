It's the other way around: if we include CooperateBot among the options, Masquerade looks at playing CooperateBot against the other Masquerade, and sees that this would be the worst of its options. It sticks with FairBot.

The only reason I didn't include CooperateBot in the proofs above is that it would make me write several more easy lemmas (and make everyone read them).
