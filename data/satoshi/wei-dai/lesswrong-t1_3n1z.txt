&gt;Perhaps you weren't aware that EFF is a "digital rights advocacy and legal organization"? If we can imagine that Bitcoin might have legal issues, how could that have escaped the people at EFF?

I'm aware of that.  I'm just saying it doesn't follow that they put it through the rigorous examination you seem to imagine, given that e.g. they may not expect many such donations, had more pressing priorities, knew it would have issues but were prepared to be the test case, etc.  Or maybe they just reasoned, as you are doing, that "X accepts it, so it must not have legal issues", not expecting the pseudo-evidence to cascade to others.
