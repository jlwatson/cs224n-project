&gt; It is possible that human morality, when extrapolated, shows no coherence

For example, I have no idea what this means. I don't know what "extrapolated" means, apart from some vague intuitions, and even what "coherent" means.

&gt; Are you saying that Eliezer's general approach might still turn out to be correct, if we substitute better definitions or understandings of "extrapolation" and/or "coherence"?

Better than what? I have no specific adequate candidates, only a direction of research.
