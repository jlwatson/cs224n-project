I don't really know the answer to that question.

*In principle*, you start with a human brain, and extract from it somehow a description of what it means when it says "morality". Presumably involving some kind of analysis of what would make the human say "that's good!" or "that's bad!", and/or of what computational processes inside the brain are involved in deciding whether to say "good" or "bad". The output is, in theory, a function mapping things to how much they match "good" or "bad" in your human's language.

The 'simple' solution, of just simulating what your human would say after being exposed to every possible moral argument, runs into trouble with what exactly constitutes an argument—if an UFAI can hack your brain into doing terrible things just by talking to you, clearly not all verbal engagement can be allowed—and also more mundane issues like our simulated human going insane from all this talking.
