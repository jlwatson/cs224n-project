That sounds sensible, but even on rereading, it is entirely unclear to me where the OP said anything about that. Maybe I just lack the physics grooves in my brain that would help me grok this, but I can't be the only one.

If that is in fact the point of this post, I think it could vastly improved by saying at the outset "here's this new hypothetical physics that physicists are playing with that is interesting to us because X" and then discussing the implications rather than just the physics and math.

and if X really is something about reconciling physical reductionism with positivism, then I'm totally confused, because those things don't seem to need reconciling.
