Thank you so much Wei Dai for all the answers. 

You say other previously active member would have been identified base on this writing and coding style. There is exacly what Skye Grey says he/she's doing for matching Szabo with Satoshi on the blog LikeinaMirror - he say's he's 99,9% sure Szabo is Satoshi. https://likeinamirror.wordpress.com/2014/03/

Dorian Nakamoto theory may have any ground? 

What made you think Satoshi motivation was distrust rather than crypto-anarchy? Someone that have loose money for instance  in Lehman Brothers banrupcy?  It was also in 2008

Why is anonimity important to crypto community? Just to confirm, Wei Dai is a pseudonym?

Thank you again
