You seem to be making this a more complicated example than it has to be.  All that has to be done to show the difference between these resolution strategies is to have the following setup:

You're unsure of how your values treat the utility of an action A; you give 99.9% odds that it has expected utility 0 and 0.1% odds that it has utility 1,000,000.
You're sure that an action B has expected utility 1 by your values.

But in this format, it looks silly to do anything but treat it as the simple expected-utility problem *a la* Robin.  Is this somehow not a correct version of your dilemma, or is there some reason we should be horrified at the result of choosing A?
