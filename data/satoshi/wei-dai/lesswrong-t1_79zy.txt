&gt; Do you think there is such an equivalent to Lob's theorem, and if so what might it say?

In the Q&amp;A to the open problems talk, he said that if logical uncertainty is the solution to the problem, then he and Marcello didn't figure out how, and they did look in that specific place.

I think that it would be useful to try to make some progress about how to reason probabilistically about logical statements before trying to use it as the solution to other problems, because my picture of how it could work is so unclear that I feel unable to draw any conclusions about what it can or cannot do with any kind of certainty. For example, I do not know a condition on a probability distribution over mathematical statements that would prevent the [spurious proof problem](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2l2/what_a_reduction_of_could_could_look_like/2f7w) -- when I read about playing chicken with the universe, it sounded very familiar, but I can't now see a way to apply it in the case of a probability distribution. (Then again, if we do expect to find a solution to the Löbian problems in that area, perhaps we should be working on logical uncertainty now, not on Löbian problems...)
