&gt;You already know that you know how to compute "Awesomeness", and it doesn't feel like it has a mysterious essence that you need to study to discover. 

I wish! Both metaethics and normative ethics are still mysterious and confusing to me (despite having read Eliezer's sequence). Here's a sample of problems I'm faced with, none of which seem to be helped by replacing the word "right" with "awesome": [1](http://lesswrong.com/lw/196/boredom_vs_scope_insensitivity/) [2](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1hg/the_moral_status_of_independent_identical_copies/) [3](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1l4/a_masterslave_model_of_human_preferences/) [4](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1mo/the_preference_utilitarians_time_inconsistency/) [5](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1ns/value_uncertainty_and_the_singleton_scenario/) [6](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1r9/shut_up_and_divide/) [7](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4qg/a_thought_experiment_on_pain_as_a_moral_disvalue/) [8](http://lesswrong.com/lw/fyb/ontological_crisis_in_humans/) [9](http://lesswrong.com/lw/g3l/morality_isnt_logical/861y). I'm concerned this post might make a lot of people feel more clarity than they actually possess, and more importantly and unfortunately from my perspective, less inclined to look into the problems that continue to puzzle me.
