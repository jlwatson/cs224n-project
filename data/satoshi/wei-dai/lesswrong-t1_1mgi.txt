It's not I think that we don't suffer from confirmation bias - of course we do, and I doubt that we do properly compensate for it - it's that *saying* "groupthink" or "confirmation bias" without providing evidence doesn't advance the debate any, and seems to constitute no more than a way of sneering at people for not agreeing with you.
