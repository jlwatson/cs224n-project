It seems to me that the original UDT already incorporated this type of approach to solving naturalized induction. See [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jd9/building_phenomenological_bridges/a8ai) and [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jg1/solomonoff_cartesianism/an1h) for previous discussions. Also, UDT, as originally described, was intended as a variant of EDT (where the "action" in EDT is interpreted as "this source code implements this policy (input/output map)". MIRI people seem to mostly prefer a causal variant of UDT, but my position has always been that the evidential variant is simpler so let's go with that until there's conclusive evidence that the evidential variant is not good enough.

LZEDT seems to be more complex than UDT but it's not clear to me that it solves any additional problems. If it's supposed to have advantages over UDT, can you explain what those are?
