It's not just indexical uncertainty, it's any kind of uncertainty, as possible worlds can [trade with each other](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3l/counterfactual_mugging/). Independence is approximation, adequate for our low-intelligence times, but breaking down as it becomes possible to study counterfactuals. It's more obvious with indexical uncertainty, where the information can be transferred in apparent form by stupid physics, and less obvious with normal uncertainty, where it takes a mind.
