Luke, what is the meta-purpose of this sequence? It seems that you are trying to dissolve the persisting confusion about ethics, but what is the underlying purpose? I doubt this sequence is a terminal goal of yours, am I wrong? The reason for my doubt is that, before you started writing this sequence, you [decided to](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=15134) join the visiting fellows program at the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Which makes me infer that the purpose of this sequence has to do with friendly AI research. 

If I am right that the whole purpose of this sequence has to do with friendly AI research, then how is it useful to devote so much resources to explaining the basics, instead of trying to figure out how to design, or define mathematically, something that could extrapolate human volition?
