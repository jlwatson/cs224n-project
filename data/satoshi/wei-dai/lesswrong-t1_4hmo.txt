&gt;I think that you are saying that there are 'real' values of position, momentum, spin, etc., but that quantum mechanics only describes our knowledge about them.

I *am* saying that the wave function (to be specific) describes one's knowledge about position, momentum, spin, etc., but I make *no* claim that these have any â€˜real' values.

In the absence of a real post, here are some links:

*  John Baez (ed, 2003), [Bayesian Probability Theory and Quantum Mechanics](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/bayes.html) (a collection of Usenet posts, with an introduction);
*  Carlton Caves et al (2001), [Quantum probabilities as Bayesian probabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0106133)  (a paper published in Physical Reviews A).

By the way, you seem to have got this, but I'll say it anyway for the benefit of any other readers, since it's short and sums up the idea: *The wave function exists in the map, not in the territory.*
