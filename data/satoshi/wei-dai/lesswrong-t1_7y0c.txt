They're still citations to his body of work, which is all on pretty much the same topic. SEP is good, but it is just an encyclopedia, after all, and _Being No One_ is a very challenging book (I still haven't read it because it's too hard for me). A general citation search would be more useful; I see 647 citations to it in Google Scholar. (I don't know of a citation engine specializing in philosophy - Philpapers shows a fair bit of activity related to Metzinger but doesn't give me how many philosophy papers cite it, much less philosophy of mind.)
