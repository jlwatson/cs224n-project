There is a $.99 iPhone App that does essentially the same thing using the phone's accelerometers, etc.  called Sleep Cycle http://www.mdlabs.se/sleepcycle/
It definitely seems to have had a positive impact on my mornings.  Less biometrics than the Zeo probably, but certainly more economical if you have an iPhone.
