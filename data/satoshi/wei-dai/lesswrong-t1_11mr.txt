Currently, lots of discussions just end without the last commenter or readers knowing why.

So, feature idea: add a way for the author of the parent of a comment to set an "agreement status" with the following options by clicking a button:

* I don't understand this yet. Still trying.
* I don't understand this. I give up.
* I agree.
* I disagree, and will write up the reasons later.
* I disagree, but don't want to bother writing out why.
* I need to think about this more.
* I already addressed this before.
* [other options if needed]
