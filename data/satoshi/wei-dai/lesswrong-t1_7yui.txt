Are there more detailed discussions of this risk that you can link to? I'm curious about synthetic biology's practitioners' justifications (or rationalizations) for having few safety measures, given how seemingly obvious the risk is to an outsider. In general, it seems like you're wasting the attention that you're drawing to this countdown by not pointing people to more information.
