Again, I agree there are benefits, I just dispute their characterization by Wei\_Dai et al.  EFF is not "endorsing" Bitcoin in the sense usually meant; they're saying they'll accept donations that way.  There's a *huge* difference between that and "Oh, but these respectable lawyer guys told this big organization it'd be okay!"

Anyway, I did join up.  If you look at the map of users, I'm the singular dude in Waco.
