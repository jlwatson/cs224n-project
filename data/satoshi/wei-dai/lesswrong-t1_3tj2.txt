There's a fresh [Metafilter thread](http://www.metafilter.com/102154/BaezYudkowsky) on John Baez's interview of Yudkowsky. It also mentions HP:MoR.

Noticed this comment:

&gt; I started reading Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality once and it drove me crazy. The book's Harry Potter doesn't practice rationality, he practices empiricism.

So people actually do start thinking of the Enlightenment era school of philosophy, [like some earlier commenters feared](http://lesswrong.com/lw/cx/whats_in_a_name_that_which_we_call_a_rationalist/11vb).  I also remembered a couple of philosophy blog posts from a few years ago, [The Remnants of Rationalism](http://onphilosophy.wordpress.com/2007/06/07/the-remnants-of-rationalism/) and [A Lesson Forgotten](http://onphilosophy.wordpress.com/2007/06/23/a-lesson-forgotten/), which seem to work from the assumption that 'rationalism' will be understood to mean an abandoned school of philosophy.

Redefining established terms is a crank indicator, so stuff like this might be worth paying attention to.
