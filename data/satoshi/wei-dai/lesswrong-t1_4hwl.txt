It's certainly plausible to decelerate rapidly by grabbing onto the pavement. You can decelerate even faster by running into a concrete wall.  I suspect that 5g is more than the car (or its inhabitants?) can sustain without injury. I'm sure that digging into the pavement won't go over well with the local highway department.

Note also that 50km/hr isn't all that fast -- 31ish MPH I think -- and that kinetic energy goes as the square of speed. So at freeway speeds, you'll do proportionately more pavement damage.
