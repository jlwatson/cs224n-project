Could you list the previous discussions of CEV that you already have? I ask because you don't seem to mention the problem with CEV described in [this post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2b7/hacking_the_cev_for_fun_and_profit/).

ETA: Also [this post](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/49j/why_do_we_engage_in_moral_simplification/) gives another reason why coherence may not occur.
