&gt;If death is horrible then I should fight death, not fight my own grief.

Yes, but how do you tell whether death is horrible or not?

In other words, how is one supposed to know which of the following is true?

1. Preventing death is the real terminal value. Grief is a rational feeling that has instrumental value (for motivating oneself to fight death).
2. Avoiding grief is the real terminal value. Preventing death is just a subgoal of avoiding grief (and one should fight grief directly if that's easier/more effective).
