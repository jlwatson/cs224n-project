That's a really interesting question; I don't know. At the very least, what's needed is for both agents to be using hierarchies of proof attempts such that the later attempts of one can answer questions about the early attempts of the other, and vice versa. Maybe some LÃ¶bian cycle still works if this is the case, or maybe they really do need to be using equivalent deductive systems at some point.
