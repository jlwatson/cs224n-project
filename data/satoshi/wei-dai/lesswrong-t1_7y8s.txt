This isn't WBE or even AGI, because they essentially programed the simulated brain to perform certain specific tasks, by writing down algorithms for doing those tasks and then choosing synaptic connection weights to implement those algorithms. (See [this paper](http://ctnsrv.uwaterloo.ca/cnrglab/node/291) for details.) Neuromorphic AI is scary because someone might be able to build an AGI without having to understand general intelligence on an algorithmic level, but that's not how Spaun works, at least not the current iteration of it.
