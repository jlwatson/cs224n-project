I'll grant that "Chris lost their wallet" is a distinctly modern usage - if you prefer "Chris lost his or her wallet", please use the latter. I think the extension of singular they is the more elegant solution to the problem of unknown genders (particularly in communities where the answer to "he or she?" is sometimes "no" - I have visited such online), but I'll grant that it is a judgment call.
