All else being the same we should prefer a late coin toss over an early one, but we should prefer an early coin toss that definitely came up tails over a late coin toss that might come up either way. Learning that the coin toss is still ahead is bad news in the same way as learning that the coin came up tails is good news. Bad news is not isomorphic to making a bad choice. An agent that maximizes good news behaves quite differently from a rational actor.
