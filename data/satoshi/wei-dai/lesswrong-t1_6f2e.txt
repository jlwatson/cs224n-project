&gt;  Are you thinking of the time when I said arguing with you wasn't fun, or something worse than that?

I don't recall you saying that. (ie. If/when you did say that it didn't etch itself in my mind as a glaring social defection worth remembering). 

&gt;  I'd like to know because I honestly can't remember writing any comments that might be considered "flagrant"

What you consider ok may be different to what I consider ok.

I'm not saying your tone isn't better than most, but I'm certainly going to dispute it whenever you are put up on a pedestal as "wonderfully consistent". (ie. I don't want to bring up history, but claims of consistency *are* historical claims, and false ones at that!)
