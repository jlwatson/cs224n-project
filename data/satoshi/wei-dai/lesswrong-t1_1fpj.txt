&gt; It seems clear that on a revealed preference level, people do care about measure, and not the number of branches, since nobody actually attempts quantum suicide, nor do they try to do anything to increase the branching rate.

Do you think that the thing that, as a historical fact, causes people to not try quantum suicide, is the argument that it decreases measure? I doubt this a lot. Do you think that if people were told that it preserved measure, they would be popping off to do it all the time? 

I don't think that people are revealing a preference for measure here. I think that they're revealing that they trust their instinct to not do weird things that look like suicide to their subconscious.
