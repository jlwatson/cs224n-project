What I want my main point to be, upon further reflection, is that **If we find ourselves in a situation where we don't know enough to know what's the most effective, the proper reaction is not to pursue impact, but instead find ways to reduce our uncertainty**.

So if we don't know about which has more ripple effects, we should invest in finding out, not pick at random.
