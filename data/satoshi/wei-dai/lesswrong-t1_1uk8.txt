"The two scenarios involving Omega are only meant to establish that a late great filter should not be considered worse news than an early great filter."

I honestly think this would have been way, way, way clearer if you had dropped the Omega decision theory stuff, and just pointed out that, given great filters of equal probability, choosing an early great filter over a late great filter would entail wiping out the history of humanity in addition to the galactic civilization that we could build, which most of us would definitely see as worse.
