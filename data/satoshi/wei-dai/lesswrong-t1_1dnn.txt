I think the Methuselah Foundation's [credit card idea](https://www.mfoundation.org/index.php?pagename=mj_donate_other) might also be a good way to receive donations without people actively donating money. Probably also buys more warm fuzzies per dollar, since you can feel good every time you use your credit card.
