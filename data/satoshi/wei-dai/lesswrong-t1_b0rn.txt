&gt;What other resources have increasing marginal utility?

[Matter](http://lesswrong.com/lw/12v/fair_division_of_blackhole_negentropy_an/), if negentropy translates to utility by more than its square root, for example if negentropy translates linearly to increased lifespan and/or population, and we value lifespan/population linearly as well.

&gt;How undervalued are they? 

I'm guessing that most people do not realize the above, and therefore underestimate just how high the maximum utility of the universe can be.
