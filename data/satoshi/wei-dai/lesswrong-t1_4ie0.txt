&gt; Wouldn't it be surprising that the intelligence threshold for building UFAI and FAI turn out to be the same?

Probably not, since you use knowledge to build things, not just intelligence, and knowledge accumulates. For example, humans can build (invent) both windmills and space shuttles, and lower intelligence would probably bar humans from building (inventing) windmills.
