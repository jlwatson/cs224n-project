Hey, my name is Roman. You can read my detailed bio [here](http://cecs.louisville.edu/ry), as well as some research papers I published on the topics of AI and security. I decided to attend a local LW meet up and it made sense to at least register on the site. My short term goal is to find some people in my geographic area (Louisville, KY, USA) to befriend.
