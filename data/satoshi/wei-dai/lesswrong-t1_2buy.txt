Do you think that the best way achieve solutions to meta-philosophy is to actually *do* philosophy? I ask because, like other posters, I'm skeptical of the magnitude of contributions from the *field of philosophy* with regard to philosophical insights. I'm definitely biased, being not nearly as familiar with philosophy as I am with science, but it seems to me that math and science do a great majority of the heavy lifting.

This is not to downplay the importance of philosophy in general, because I think Daniel Dennett is spot on when he says "[T]here is no such thing as philosophy-free; there is only science whose philosophical baggage is taken on board without examination." (I think there's a good argument that the entire symbolic AI program was a *major* philosophy-fail). It's really more a question of methodology.

The issue I see is that to giving a satisfactory answer to a question like "what is the nature of philosophy, and how do we use it?" likely involves a whole hell of a lot of neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, etc. research, and it seems unlikely that much can be gained by a philosophical approach to the question (which I assume involves surveying all the relevant scientific and philosophical literature, and then making reasoned arguments for why some aspect of philosophy use must be a certain way).
