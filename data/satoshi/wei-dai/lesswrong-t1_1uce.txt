My take on this issue is as follows:

There are a whole bunch of mental faculties - skill at which scientists have demonstrated is represented pretty well by a single quantity, g.  That result leaves remarkably little space for a different, but nearby concept of instrumental rationality.

So: terminology in this area appears to be in quite a mess - with two historically well-known terms jostling together in a space where scientists are telling us there is only *really* one thing.  Maybe there are *three* jostling terms - if you include "reason".

So: we need some philosophers of science to wade in and propose some resolutions to this mess.
