Your point is a valid one, but in practice, I don't think it alters the bottom line. Some points:

* It's not clear to me that AMF's net recipients are poorer than usual. If they're not, you might wonder why the people don't purchase nets themselves. I think that they may not be fully aware of the health benefits. You have to cover on the order of 400 people with nets to save a single life, and people may not be attuned to such small probabilities. 
* I think that the difference in income between "average" and "poorest of the poor" in these countries is probably no more than a factor of 2.
* Note that the poorest of the poor may be able to improve their economic standing over the next 50 years.
