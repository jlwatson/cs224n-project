About *me*.

In person, I'm fairly obviously girl-shaped.  No one has ever made this mistake when interacting with me in person, and I don't have to do Obvious Girl Thingsâ„¢ to get that accuracy - don't have to swish around in crinoline, don't have to conveniently quote third parties who refer to me as "she", don't have to carry my purse everywhere I go, or even say my *name* (which is a girls' name).  People don't assume based on where I *am* or what I'm *doing* or how *surprising it would be* for me to be a girl before they figure out that I *am one anyway* and pronoun me accordingly.

And - in person, when people can't tell what gender someone is, they *don't* guess, unless they feel able to rely on visual cues or maybe being married to someone of a known gender (and when they are wrong they are *mortified*).  People will bend over backwards to avoid using the wrong pronoun for someone who's in the room with them.  They'll ask third parties or construct their sentences to avoid making the assumption or learn the person's name to get a clue.  It's just not socially acceptable to get it wrong.

Online, people feel free to guess, and on the geeky parts of the Internet I frequent this is most likely to affect women negatively.  (I also frequent various anti-prejudice parts of the Internet, but there a) I generally lurk and b) under the circumstances they take the trouble to be careful about that sort of thing!)

Now, I recognize this disparity is because it's considered insulting to say that someone *looks like* the opposite gender, and not so with *writing like* the opposite gender... except that when people talk about third parties one of them knows in person and the other doesn't, the one who doesn't know doesn't casually hurl pronoun caution to the wind even though someone is right there to correct them should they be wrong without any implications about anyone's looks having been made.  When there is a mechanism to find out a *real person's* gender, it gets taken advantage of.  With *real people*, you don't guess, you find out, and if you're wrong, that's not okay.

Getting my gender wrong when it would have been pretty easy to get it right (for crying out loud, *ask me*!  Or someone else!  Or do the most cursory of searches for "alicorn gender" on this very site - it's in the second result!) signifies that I am not a "real person" in the above sense.  It's okay to guess.  It doesn't matter if you get it wrong.  He won't care, and if she does, it's about eir politics or something dismissible like that, not about whether you took four seconds to fact-check.  Not about identity, or consideration, or the fact that this happens about once a week and the blogger, unlike most people who make the mistake, *doesn't even have a way for me to correct em*.
