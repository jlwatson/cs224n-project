If someone like me who failed secondary school can come up with such ideas before coming across the SIAI, I thought that someone who writes SF novels about the idea of a technological singualrity might too. And you don't have to link me to the post about 'Generalizing From One Example', I'm aware of it.

And Charles Stross was not the only person that I named, by the way. At least one of those people is a member on this site.
