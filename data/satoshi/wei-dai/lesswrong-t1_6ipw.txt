&gt; Instrumental rationality, i.e. "winning"? Lots...

Precisely. 

&gt;Epistemic rationality? None...

I'm not sure it got that either. It's more like medieval theology / scholasticism. There are questions you think you need answered, you can't answer them now with logical thought, you use empty cargo cult imitation of reasonable thought. How rational is that? Not rational at all. Wei_Dai is here because he was concerned with AI, and calls this community rational because he sees concern with AI as rational and needs confirmation. It is neatly circular system - if the concern with AI is rational, then every community that is rational must be concerned with AI, then the communities that are not concerned with AI are less rational.
