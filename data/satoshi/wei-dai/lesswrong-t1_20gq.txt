&gt; just plain bored with having nothing to say but the same small talk everyone else is making.

this is indicative that you are paying attention to the topic/words of the conversation, rather than the sub-communication, which is often the interesting bit for these kinds of conversations. People who can't read social cues and sub-communication typically don't get why others find small talk so "interesting", but this is rather like a radio that sends the carrier wave rather than the signal to the loudspeaker.  The topics are just there as a "carrier wave" which is then modulated to encode social signals. 

Sub-communication includes agreement/disagreement (someone agrees with you to signal alliance, disagrees to signal enmity), tone of voice (tone that rises towards the end of the sentence indicates submission, tone that falls towards the end conflict/assertiveness/dominance), body language, who gets to talk most/who listens most. Once you tune your radio in, you may find such occasions more exciting. 

Tuning in to the carrier wave in social situations is a common failure mode for smart people, because we feel comfortable assessing factual statements.
