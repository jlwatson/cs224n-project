Much of SIAI's research ([Carl Shulman's](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/7ob/timeline_of_carl_shulman_publications/) in particular) are focused not directly on FAI but more generally on better understanding the dynamics of various scenarios that could lead to a Singularity. Such research could help us realize a positive Singularity through means other than directly building an FAI.

Does SIAI have any plans to expand such research activities, either in house, or by academia or independent researchers? (If not, why?)
