Hello, We are students in 11th grade from Paris, 17 years old. We're doing a project on the bitcoin and cryptomoney. This project is part of the high school diploma and we were wondering if we could ask you a few questions about the subject. First what is the "bitcoin" for you and what is it's use? 
Do you think cryptomoney could totally replace physical money and would it be better? 
How long have you been working on the subject and what do you stand for?
Thank you.
