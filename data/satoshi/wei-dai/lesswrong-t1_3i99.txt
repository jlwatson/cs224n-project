&gt; But even if "make very little difference" is true, it's little in a relative sense ...

The conjecture is that it is true in an absolute sense.  It would have made no sense at all for me to *even mention it* if I had meant it in the relative sense that you set up here as a straw man and then knock down.

There is something odd going on here.  Three very intelligent people are interpreting what I write quite differently than the way I intend it.  Probably it is because I generated confusion by misusing words that have a fixed meaning here.  And, in this case, it may be because you were thinking of our "fragility" conversation rather than the main posting.  But, whatever the reason, I'm finding this very frustrating.
