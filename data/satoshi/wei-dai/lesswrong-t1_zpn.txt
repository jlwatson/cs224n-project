Shelling was actually the less ruthless of the pioneers of game theory.  The other pioneer was Von Neumann who advocated a unilateral nuclear attack on the USSR before they developed their own nuclear weapons.

By contrast, Shelling invented the red hotline between the US and USSR, since more communication meant less chance of WW3.

Basically he was about ruthlessness for the good of humanity.
