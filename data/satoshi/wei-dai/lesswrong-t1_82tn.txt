&gt; When is a fetus or baby capable of feeling pain (that has moral disvalue)?

At some point between being a blob of cells and being a fully formed baby popping out of Mommy, with the disvalue on a sliding scale. Where is the crisis?

For non-human animals, I disapprove of torturing animals for kicks, but am fine with using animals for industrial purposes, including food and medical testing. No crisis here either. 

In life, I don't kill people, and I also don't alleviate a great deal of death and suffering that I might. I eat meat, I wear leather, and support abortion rights. No crisis. And I don't see a lot of other people in crisis over such things either.
