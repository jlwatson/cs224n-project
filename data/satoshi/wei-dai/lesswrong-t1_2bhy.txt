I don't believe FAI is ready to be an engineering project. As [Richard Hamming](http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html) would put it, "we do not have an attack". You can't build a 747 before some hobbyist invents the first flyer. The "throw money and people at it" approach has been tried many times with AGI, how is FAI different? I think right now most progress should come from people like you, satisfying their personal interest. As for the best use of SIAI money, I'd use Givewell to get rid of it, or just throw some parties and have fun all around, because money isn't the limiting factor in making math breakthroughs happen.
