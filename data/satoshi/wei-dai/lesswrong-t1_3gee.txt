I'm asking (1) how is it possible that Eliezer's "right" doesn't designate anything, and (2) how could you arrive at such a strong conclusion based on his non-technical writings, since he could just mean something different, or could have insufficient precision in his own idea to determine this property (this is a meta-point possibly subsumed by the first point).
