Do the current moderation policies allow editors to add "next in sequence" and "previous in sequence" links to posts that don't already have such links, and are there any editors willing to do this? If not, can we change the policy to allow this? And I'd like to volunteer to add such links at least to the posts that I [come across](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2x8/lets_split_the_cake_lengthwise_upwise_and/) (I'm already a moderator but not an editor).
