Hmm, wasn't trying to be defensive. It was a valid criticism of the site. I just was worried that I had given the impression that I thought it was a place for advice! Relsqui kind of thought that, so I thought it needed a disclaimer.

I wished to give the reasons that I had recommended it under, to dispell any lingering impression that I might be advising people to talk about zeus by proxy.

&gt;I'm just annoyed that the author doesn't do a better job analyzing the data (that presumably only he has access to).

I prefer to look at it from a half full perspective. Most other web businesses don't release any analyses at all.
