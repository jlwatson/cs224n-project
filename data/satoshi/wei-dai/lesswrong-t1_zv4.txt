&gt; "Ah..." Ghufhus said, puzzled.  "How do you... know all this?  Is there a Counter-Force in your own world?"
&gt;
&gt; *Fool*, Aerhien thought to herself.  The hero had seemed puzzled by the idea, at first, and had needed to ask for examples.  She decided then and there that Ghufhus would meet with an accident before the next council meeting; their world had no room for stupid Eerionnath.

That's a bit harsh, don't you think? Maybe the Counter-Force is known by a different name in the Hero's own world, and he asked for examples to make sure they're the same thing.

Actually, why doesn't the Hero's world have a Counter-Force? Shouldn't every world have something like it? How many times have our world escaped from the brink of nuclear annihilation, for example?
