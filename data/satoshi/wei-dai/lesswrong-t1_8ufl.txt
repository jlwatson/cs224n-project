Meta discussions can sometimes be very productive, like when they result in some beneficial change in site policy or an insight that makes subsequent discussions go a bit better (see [this post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/13s/the_nature_of_offense/) for an example). I'm curious why orthonormal (or others) find meta discussions so annoying. Is it just that they have a *tendency* to be low quality and unproductive, or is it something inherent in being meta?
