&gt; I think it would be more accurate to refer to it as the neuroscience of primate values

Sure. We do know a fair bit about specifically *human* values, too, but I haven't written much about that yet.

I'm curious to know why it is that you disagree with what I'll call Claim 1:

&gt; But whatever our intended meaning of 'ought' is, the same reasoning applies. Either our intended meaning of 'ought' refers (eventually) to the world of math and physics (in which case the is-ought gap is bridged), or else it doesn't (in which case it fails to refer).

...and what you think is wrong about Claim 2:

&gt; It suggests that there is no One True Theory of Morality. (We use moral terms in a variety of ways, and some of those ways refer to different sets of natural facts.)

Do you have the same objections as [Vladimir](http://lesswrong.com/lw/7cl/my_intentions_for_my_metaethics_sequence/4qfp)?
