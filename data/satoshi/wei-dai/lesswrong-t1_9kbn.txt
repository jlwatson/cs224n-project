If I understand this objection properly, the objection is:

(1) The executives making decisions didn't have access to what the cryptographers thought.

(2) In order for the executives to apply the elite common sense framework, they would need to have access to what the cryptographers thought.

(3) Therefore, the executives could not apply the elite common sense framework in this case.

I would agree with the first premise but reject the second. If this all happened as you say--which seems plausible--then I would frame this as a case where the elite decision makers didn't have access to the opinions of some relevant subject matter experts rather than a case where the elite decision makers didn't have access to elite common sense. In my framework, you can have access to elite common sense without having access to what relevant subject mater experts think, though in this kind of situation you should be extremely modest in your opinions. The elite decision makers still had reasonable access to elite common sense insofar as they were able to stress-test their views about what to expect if they bought this copyright protection system by presenting their opinions to a broad coalition of smart people and seeing what others thought.

I agree that you have to start from your own personal standards in order to get a grip on elite common sense. But note that this point generally applies to anyone recommending that you use any reasoning standards at all other than the ones you happen to presently have. And my sense is that people can get reasonably well in touch with elite common sense by trying to understand how other trustworthy people think and applying the framework that I have advocated here. I acknowledge that it is not easy to know about the epistemic standards that others use; what I advocate here is doing your best to follow the epistemic standards of the most trustworthy people.
