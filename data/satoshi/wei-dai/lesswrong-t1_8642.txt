There are totally models of ZFC containing sets that are models of ZFC.  See "Grothendieck universe".  Is there a reason why it'd be different in second-order logic?  I don't think a second-order set theory would pin down a *unique* model, why would it?  Unless you had some axiom stating that there were no more ordinals past a certain point in which case you might be able to get a unique model.  Unless I'm getting this all completely wrong, since I'm overrunning my expertise here.

So in retrospect I have to modify this for us to somehow suppose that the device is operating in a particular model of a second-order theory.  And then my device prints out "true" (if it's in one of the smallest models) or the device prints out "false" (if it's in a larger model), unless the device is against the background of an ST with an upper bound imposing a unique model, in which case the device does print out "true" for ST -&gt; false and from the outside, we think that this device is about a small collection of sets so this result is not surprising.

Then the question is whether it makes sense to imagine that the device is about the "largest relevant" model of a set theory - i.e., for any other similar devices, you think no other device will ever refer to a larger model than the current one, nor will any set theory successfully *force* a model larger than the current one - I think that's the point at which things get semantically interesting again.
