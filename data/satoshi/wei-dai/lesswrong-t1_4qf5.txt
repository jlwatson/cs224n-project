This seems like a good opportunity to put down my overall thoughts on your metaethics sequence so far, in light of this clarification.

I'm skeptical that "Pluralistic Moral Reductionism" is on the right track, or that "A Crash Course in the Neuroscience of Human Motivation" (or more generally, empirical science on primate decision making and valuation mechanisms) is likely to be highly relevant to metaethics. I've been [trying](http://lesswrong.com/lw/64j/a_defense_of_naive_metaethics/4boi) to keep this skepticism to myself, in the hope that your main "solution" is yet to come, and that you would get to a detailed explanation of it more quickly if you don't spend time to defend other possibly irrelevant ideas. (I had thought that the main "solution" might be the idea of "empathic metaethics" which you indicated you would explain further in a future post, so that's what I was waiting for.)

For solving a hard problem like metaethics, I think it's a [good idea](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1g4/tips_and_tricks_for_answering_hard_questions/) to "explore multiple approaches simultaneously" and "trust your intuitions, but don't waste too much time arguing for them". That's another reason I didn't try harder to talk you out of your current metaethical ideas. But if you're not just taking these ideas as basis for one avenue of exploration, but instead are expecting others to consider them "a clear and stable platform from which to solve the hard questions of morality", that is more problematic. As far as I can tell, such a platform is still nowhere in sight.
