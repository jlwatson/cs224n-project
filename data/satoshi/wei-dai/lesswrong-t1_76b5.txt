&gt; On the issue private_messaging raises, I think it's a serious philosophical problem, but not necessarily a practical one (as he claims), assuming Solomonoff Induction could be made practical in the first place, because the hypothetical AI could quickly update away even a factor of 2^1000 when it turns on its senses, before it has a chance to make any important wrong decisions. private_messaging seems to have strong intuitions that it will be a practical problem, but he tends to be overconfident in many areas so I don't trust that too much.

Are you picturing AI that has simulated multiverse from big bang up inside a single universe, and then it just uses camera sense data to very rapidly pick the right universe? Well yes that will dispose of 2^1000 prior very easily. Something that is instead e.g. modelling humans using minimum amount of guessing without knowing what's inside their heads, and which can't really run any reductionist simulations at the level of quarks to predict it's camera data, can have real trouble getting right the fine details of it's grand unified theory of everything, and most closely approximate a crackpot scientist. Furthermore, having to include a non-reductionist model of humans, it may even end up religious (feeding stuff into human mind model to build it's theory of everything by intelligent design).

How it would work under any form of a practical bound (e.g. forbidding zillions upon zillions of the quark level simulations of everything from big bang to now to occur within an AI, which seem to me like a very conservative bound), is a highly complicated open problem. edit: and the very strong intuition I have is that you can't just dismiss this sort of stuff out of hand. So many ways it can fail. So few ways it can work great. And no rigour what so ever in the speculations here.
