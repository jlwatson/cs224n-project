Knowing that medicine is often more about [signaling care](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/showing-that-yo.html) than improving health, it's hard for me to make a big fuss over some minor ailment of a friend or family member. Consciously trying to signal care seems too fake and manipulative. Unfortunately, others then interpret my lack of fuss-making as not caring. Has anyone else run into this problem, and if so, how did you deal with it?
