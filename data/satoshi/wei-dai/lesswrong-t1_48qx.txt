That certainly seems to be to some extent true of real humans, but the point is that even if I'm to some extent a random hodgepodge, this does not obviously create in me an impulse to consult a brain scan readout or a table of my counterfactual behaviors and then follow those at the expense of whatever my other semi-random considerations are causing me to feel is right.
