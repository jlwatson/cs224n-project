Sorry to take so long to get back to you :)

&gt;What is a genuinely utilitarian lifestyle? Is there someone you can cite as living such a lifestyle?

Obviously humans are extremely ill-suited for being utilitarians (just as humans would be extremely ill-suited for being paperclip maximizers even if they wanted to be.)

When I refer to a "genuinely utilitarian lifestyle" I mean *subject to human constraints*. There are some people who do this much better than others - for example, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have done much better than most billionaires. 

I think that with a better peer network, Gates and Buffett could have done still better (for example I would have liked to see them take existential risk into serious consideration with their philanthropic efforts).

A key point here is that as I've said [elsewhere](http://towardabetterworld.wordpress.com/2010/06/08/altruism-and-sacrifice/) I don't think that leading a (relatively) utilitarian lifestyle has very much at all to do with personal sacrifice, but rather with realigning one's personal motivational structure in a way that (at least for many people) does not entail a drop in quality of life. If you haven't already done so, see my post on [missed opportunities for doing well by doing good](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2ha/missed_opportunities_for_doing_well_by_doing_good/?sort=controversial). 

&gt;I'm not sure what you're talking about in the last sentence. Prevent what from happening to Eliezer? Failing to lose hope when he should? (He wrote a post about that, BTW.)

Thanks for the reference. I edited the end of my posting to clarify what I had in mind.
