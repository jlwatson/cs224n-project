I have an idea that has all the trappings of a crackpot idea. It would bring me fame and glory if it panned out. I don't know exactly how it will work. I never talk to anyone about it, because I'm afraid they'll steal it or laugh at it. I have no solid rational argument that I will succeed; it's just a strong hunch.

What should a person do in cases like this? Read up on the field that the idea is in (I'm not an expert, or even a serious student, as you could probably guess), and try to find an argument showing that the idea won't work? Try to develop the idea further and further until it falls apart?
