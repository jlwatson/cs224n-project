This is an interesting way to view neural networks. After seeing your post, I happened to come across [JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2xcyrl/i_am_j%C3%BCrgen_schmidhuber_ama), where he gave a similar but less detailed [explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2xcyrl/i_am_j%C3%BCrgen_schmidhuber_ama/cp58bgj) about how "RNN-based CM system of 1990 may be viewed as a limited, downscaled, sub-optimal, but at least computationally feasible approximation of AIXI".
