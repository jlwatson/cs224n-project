I was asking for a rigorous model of that: some controlled tournament setting that you could implement in Python today, and two small programs you could implement in Python today that would do what you mean. Surely the hard AI issues shouldn't pose a problem because you can always hardcode any "understanding" that goes on, e.g. "this here incoming packet says that I should do X". At least that's my direction of inquiry, because I'm too scared of making hard-to-notice mistakes when handwaving about such things.
