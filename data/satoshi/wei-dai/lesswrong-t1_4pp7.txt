Does the "paradox of choice" (too many choices result in less satisfaction) apply to big decision as well as small ones? (It could be that too many choices imposes a psychological cost that's independent of the value of the decision, while the material benefit of having more choices scales with the value.) I couldn't find a clear answer from Barry Schwartz's [book](http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/0060005688), but the advice he gives in the last chapter:

&gt;To manage the problem of excessive choice, we must decide
which choices in our lives really matter and focus our time and
energy there, letting many other opportunities pass us by.

seems to imply that he doesn't think "overshopping" necessarily applies to big decisions like buying a house.
