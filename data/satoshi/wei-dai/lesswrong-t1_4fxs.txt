One related argument is the Open Question Argument: for any natural property F that an action might have, be it *promotes my terminal values*, or *is the output of an Eliezerian computation that models my coherent extrapolated volition*, or whatever the details might be, it's always coherent to ask: "I agree that this action is F, but is it *good*?"

But the intuitions that any metaethics worthy of the name must allow for fundamental disagreement and fallibility are perhaps more basic than this.  I'd say they're just the criteria that we (at least, many of us) have in mind when insisting that any morality worthy of the name must be "objective", in a certain sense.  These two criteria are proposed as capturing that sense of objectivity that we have in mind. (Again, don't you find something bizarrely subjectivist about the idea that we're fundamentally morally infallible -- that we can't even question whether our fundamental values / CEV are really on the right track?)
