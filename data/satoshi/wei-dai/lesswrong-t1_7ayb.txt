Wei, do you assume uploading capability would stay local for long stretches of subjective time? If yes, why? (WBE seems to require large-scale technological development, which I'd expect to be fueled by many institutions buying the tech and thus fueling progress -- compare genome sequencing -- so I'd expect multiple places to have the same currently-most-advanced systems at any point in time, or at least being close to the bleeding edge.) If no, why expect the uploads that go FOOM first to be ones that work hard to improve chances of friendliness, rather than primarily working hard to be the first to FOOM?
