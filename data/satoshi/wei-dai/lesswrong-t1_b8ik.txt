Evolution hasn't produced a satisfactory general intelligence,  so I'm not sure how much can be deduced from it. And the red queen race theory posits that human intelligence developed more from internal competition anyway. And most animal intelligences are extremely specialised.

Hum... I feel the analogy with evolution isn't that informative.
