I think if you apply this reasoning to moral conflict between different kinds of altruism, it becomes a restatement of "purchase fuzzies and utilons separately", except with more idealized assumptions about partial selves as rational strategists. It seems to me that if I'm the self that wants utilons, then "purchase fuzzies and utilons separately" is a more realistic strategy for me to use in that it gives up only what is needed to placate the other selves, rather than what the other selves could bargain for if they too were rational agents. With parliament-like approaches to moral conflict it sometimes feels to me as though I'm stuck in a room with a rabid gorilla and I'm advised to turn into half a gorilla to make the room's output more agenty, when what is really needed is some relatively small amount of gorilla food, or maybe a tranquilizer gun.
