Er... if you answered *why* you care, I'm failing to find where you did so. Listing what you care about doesn't answer the question.

I don't think it's controversial that 'why do you care about that' is either unanswerable, or answerable only in terms of something like evolution or neurochemestry, in the case of terminal values.
