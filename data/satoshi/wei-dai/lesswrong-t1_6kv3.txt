If we're relying on a future superintelligence to reconstruct our brains, why not make it a little harder?

There's no reason you couldn't buy a wearable camera that recorded your inputs and outputs, and back everything up to hard disks in HD.  Much cheaper to store than a frozen brain.  After a few decades of video, there would have to be more than enough data to do the reconstruction.  Then, when you die, you just stick the big stack-o-harddrives into a vault and wait for the future AI overlord to find them, scan them, and put them back together into a person again.  Boom.  Immortality on the cheap.
