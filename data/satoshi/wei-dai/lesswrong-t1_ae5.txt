Then the question is whether AIs can (a) trustworthily verify each other's source code by e.g. sending in probes to do random inspections which include verifying that the inspected software is not deliberately opaque nor is it set to accept coded overrides from outside, or (b) don't need to verify each other's source code because the vast majority of initial conditions converge on the same obvious answer to PD problems.
