I may bit a bit in over my head here, but I also don't see a strong distinction between saying "Assume on Twin Earth that water is XYZ" and saying "Omega creates a world where..." Isn't the point of a thought experiment to run with the hypothetical and trace out its implications? Yes, care must be taken not to over-infer from the result of that to a real system that may not match it, but how is this news? I seem to recall some folks (m'self included) finding that squicky with regard to "Torture vs Dust Specks" -- if you stop resisting the question and just do the math the answer is obvious enough, but that doesn't imply one believes that the scenario maps to a realizable condition.

I may just be confused here, but superficially it looks like a failure to apply the principle of "stop resisting the hypothetical" evenly.
