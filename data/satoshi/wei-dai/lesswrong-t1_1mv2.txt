Useful and interesting list, thanks.

&gt; A way to choose what subset of humanity gets included in CEV

I thought the point of defining CEV as what we would choose if we knew better was (partly) that you wouldn't have to subset. We wouldn't be superstitious, vengeful, and so on if we knew better.

Also, can you expand on what you mean by "Rawlesian Reflective Equilibrium"? Are you referring (however indirectly) to the "veil of ignorance" concept?
