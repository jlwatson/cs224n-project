Thanks! Again, didn't get much from a quick skim, let me know if you find any real meat in there.

The thing that really got my attention wasn't the assertion that there are some arguments in favour of realism, but that there are good arguments specifically against anti-realism.  

I know I've spoken of "skimming" twice here.  I promise, if Toby Ord were to say to me "this contains good arguments against anti-realism" I would read it carefully.
