Good points and I agree with pretty much all of them, but for the sake of argument I'll try to write the strongest response I can:

It seems to me that your view of value is a little bit mystical. Our minds can only estimate the value of situations that are close to normal. There's no unique way to extend a messy function from [0,1] to [-100,100]. I know you want to use philosophy to extend the domain, but I don't trust our philosophical abilities to do that, because whatever mechanism created them could only test them on normal situations. We already see different people's philosophies disagreeing much more on abnormal situations than normal ones. If I got an email from an uplifted version of me saying he found an abnormal situation that's really valuable, I wouldn't trust it much, because it's too sensitive to arbitrary choices made during uplifting (even choices made by me).

That's why it makes sense to try to come up with a normal situation that's as good as we can imagine, without looking at abnormal situations too much. (We can push the boundaries of normal and allow some mind modification, but not too much because that invites risk.) That was a big part of the motivation for my post.

If the idea of unmodified human brains living in a coarse-grained VR utopia doesn't appeal to you, I guess a more general version is describing some other kind of nice universe, and using an arbitrary strong AI to run that universe on top of ours as described in the post. Solving population ethics etc. can probably wait until we've escaped immediate disaster. Astronomical waste is a problem, but not an extreme one, because we can use up all computation in the host universe if we want. So the problem comes down to describing a nice universe, which is similar to FAI but easier, because it doesn't require translating preferences from one domain to another (like with the blue-minimizing robot).
