The evils of in-group bias are getting at me. I felt a bit of *anger* when reading this comment. Go figure, I rarely feel noticeable emotions, even in response to dramatic events. The only feature that could trigger that reaction seems to be the dissenting theme of this comment, the way it breached the normal [narrative](http://lesswrong.com/lw/13k/missing_the_trees_for_the_forest/) of the game of sane/insane statements. I wrote a [response](http://lesswrong.com/lw/b9/welcome_to_less_wrong/zau) after a small time-out, I hope it isn't tainted by that unfortunate reaction.
