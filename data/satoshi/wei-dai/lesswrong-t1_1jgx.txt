But I just described two kinds of subject matter that are the only two kinds of subject matter I know about:  physical facts and mathematical facts.  "What should be done with the universe" invokes a criterion of preference, "should", which compels humans but not Babyeaters.  If you look at the fact that the Babyeaters are out trying to make a different sort of universe, and the fact that the humans are out trying to make the universe make the way it *should* look, and you call these two facts a "disagreement", I don't understand what physical fact or logical fact is supposed to be the common subject matter which is being referred-to.  They do the babyeating thing, we do the right thing; that's not a subject matter.
