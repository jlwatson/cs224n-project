If so... is that request bad?

If you are running a program where you are trying to convince people on a large scale, then you need to be able to provide overviews of what you are saying at various levels of resolution. Getting annoyed (at one of your own donors!) for such a request is not a way to win.

Edit: At the time, Eliezer [didn't realize](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2l0/should_i_believe_what_the_siai_claims/2fid?c=1) that XiXiDu was a donor.
