When dating women, men are (traditionally) expected pick up the check. A naïve MRA might complain that this gives women an advantage, at men’s expense. Yet economic theory tells us that that men would be just bad off if *women* were expected to pick up the check. How can this be?

Layperson’s explanation: If Congress suddenly mandated that all women pick up the check, men would want to date more. They’d be more eager to ask women out, and improve their value by working out or buying nice clothes. Women would be less eager to accept date requests, knowing that they’d have to foot the bill. They would be less motivated to improve their value by working out or buying nice clothes. In the new dating market, men wouldn’t have to pick up the check, but they’d be dating flabbier women with cheaper clothes. Women would get to date fitter men in nicer clothes, but they’d have to pick up the check. Overall, neither sex is better off.

Economist’s explanation: In the sexual marketplace model, the men-pick-up-the-check norm can be modeled as a tax paid by men. [Tax incidence is not affected by which party pays the tax.]( http://books.google.com.au/books?id=nZE_wPg4Wi0C&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;ots=t5wJgXb-Ms&amp;dq=tax%20incidence%20same%20buyer%20or%20seller&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) 

This argument can be generalized for any sex/courtship double standard.
