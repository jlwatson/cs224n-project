If the UFAI convinced you of anything that wasn't true during the process - outright lies about reality or math - or biased sampling of reality producing a biased mental image, like a story that only depicts one possibility where other possibilities are more probable - then we have a simple and direct critique.

If the UFAI never deceived you in the course of telling the story, but simple measures over the space of possible moral arguments you could hear and moralities you subsequently develop, produce a spread of extrapolated volitions "almost all" of whom think that the UFAI-inspired-you has turned into something alien and unvaluable - if it flew through a persuasive keyhole to produce a very noncentral future version of you who is disvalued by central clusters of you - then it's the sort of thing a Coherent Extrapolated Volition would try to stop.
