Good morning Wei,

Thank you for doing this. It seems like an excellent solution.

My name's Dominic Frisby. I'm an author from the UK, currently working on a book on Bitcoin (http://unbound.co.uk/books/bitcoin). 

Here are some questions I'd like to ask.

1. What steps, if any, did you take to coding up your b-money idea? If none, or very few, why did you go no further with it?

2. You had some early correspondence with Satoshi. What do you think his motivation behind Bitcoin was? Was it, simply, the challenge of making something work that nobody had made work before? Was it the potential riches? Was it altruistic or political, maybe - did he want to change the world?

3. In what ways do you think Bitcoin might change the world?

4. How much of a bubble do you think it is? 

5. I sometimes wonder if Bitcoin was invented not so much to become the global reserve digital cash currency, but to prove to others that the technology can work. It was more gateway rather than final destination â€“ do you have a view here?

That's more than enough to be going on with.

With kind regards

Dominic
