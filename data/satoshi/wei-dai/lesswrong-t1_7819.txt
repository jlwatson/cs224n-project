&gt; What do you think the chances are that there is some single procedure that can be used to solve all philosophical problems?

Very low, of course.  (Then again, relative to the perspective of nonscientists, there turned out to be a single procedure that could be used to solve all empirical problems.)  But in general, problems always look much more complicated than solutions do; the presence of a host of confusions does not indicate that the set of deep truths underlying all the solutions is noncompact.
