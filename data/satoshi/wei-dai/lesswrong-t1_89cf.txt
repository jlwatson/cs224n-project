I think I'm using "anthropic" in a way consistent with the end of the first paragraph of [Fundamentals of kicking anthropic butt](http://lesswrong.com/lw/85i/fundamentals_of_kicking_anthropic_butt/) (to refer to situations in which agents get duplicated and/or there is some uncertainty about what agent an agent is). If there's a more appropriate word then I'd appreciate knowing what it is. 

My first objection is already contained in Vladimir_Nesov's comment: it seems like in general anthropic problems should be phrased entirely as decision problems and not as problems involving the assignment of odds. For example, Sleeping Beauty can be turned into *two* decision problems: one in which Sleeping Beauty is trying to maximize the expected number of times she is right about the coin flip, and one in which Sleeping Beauty is trying to maximize the probability that she is right about the coin flip. In the first case, Sleeping Beauty's optimal strategy is to guess tails, whereas in the second case it doesn't matter what she guesses. In a problem where there's no anthropic funniness, there's no difference between trying to maximize the expected number of times you're right and trying to maximize the probability that you're right, but with anthropic funniness there is. 

My second objection is that I don't understand how an agent could be convinced of the truth of a sufficiently bizarre premise. (I have the same issue with Pascal's mugging, torture vs. dust specks, and Newcomb's problem.) In this particular case, I don't understand how I could be convinced that another agent really has the capacity to perfectly simulate me. This seems like exactly the kind of thing that agents would be incentivized to lie about in order to trick me.
