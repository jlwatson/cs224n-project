For me it just spoiled the whole thing.  Banks should've kept to his original design where he'd never thought of RSI, and hence it's neither mentioned nor handwaved away, and the Culture and Idarans were both doing their best.  I can suspend my disbelief for that universe just like I can suspend my belief for FTL travel.  I can't suspend my disbelief *in the face of a bad handwave*, it just throws me right out of the story.
