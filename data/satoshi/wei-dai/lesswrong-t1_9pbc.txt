&gt; It seems really wrong for you to state any conclusions based solely on your prior

Morally wrong? ;) 

&gt;the whole point of this exercise is to gather evidence about how hard it is to plan for the future. Don't you think that given the purpose of the project, people would naturally interpret all of your writings from the project as being about the evidence that you found, rather than about your personal priors?

1. I didn't come across evidence that Wiener *did* update his beliefs. 
2. I don't necessarily stand by my remark about him not updating his beliefs. Note that the email exchange with Luke was very long.Â Taking enough care so as to make sure that *every* statement that I made was epistemically justified would have been prohibitively time consuming.
