This word "possible" carries a LOT of hidden baggage.  If math tells us anything its that LOTS of things SEEM possible to us because we aren't logically omniscient but aren't really possible.  

While we're at it, how about we drop "worlds" from the mix.  I don't think it adds anything.  If we replace it with "information flows" do things work better?
