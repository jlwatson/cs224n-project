&gt; The reason to self-modify is to make yourself indistinguishable from players who started as CDT agents, so that Omega's AIs can't condition their moves on the player's type.

Being (or performing an action) indistinguishable from X doesn't protect you from the inference that X probably resulted from such a plot. That you can decide to camouflage like this may even reduce X's own credibility (and so a lot of platonic/possible agents doing that will make the configuration unattractive). Thus, the agents need to decide among themselves what to look like: first-mover configurations is a limited resource. 

(This seems like a step towards solving bargaining.)
