It's not obvious, yeah. My failure of communication on the original post. My point, as I intended it, was that I mixed my intuitive feeling("rationalist should follow categorical imperative because it feels sensible") to an obvious fact. My reasoning was based on simplistic model of PD where punishing for non-normative things and trusting and abiding otherwise works. So, I was basically asking for clarification in a guise of a statement :)
