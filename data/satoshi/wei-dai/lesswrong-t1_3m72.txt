There's another concern here. Given the general US government history of strongly not liking things like Bitcoin, (see for example what happened to [e-dollar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold)) I'm not sure being involved with bitcoin is a good idea for the long-term success of the Singularity Institute. This is activity that is possibly illegal and it may seriously damage the SI's status in the general public if it becomes associated with it.
