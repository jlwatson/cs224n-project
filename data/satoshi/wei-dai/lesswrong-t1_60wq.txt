LW doesn't do as much as I'd like to discourage people from falling into happy death spirals about LW-style rationality, [like this](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/a25/what_happens_when_your_beliefs_fully_propagate/). There seem to be more and more people who think sacrificing their life to help build FAI is an ethical imperative. If I were Eliezer, I would run screaming in the other direction the moment I saw the first such person, but he seems to be okay with that. That's the main reason why I feel LW is becoming more cultish.
