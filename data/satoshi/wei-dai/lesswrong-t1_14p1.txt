My claims are mostly about *median* income, not average.  I am not making strong 99.9% confident claims; I am making my best estimates.  So even if I cannot prove that any future physics will limit economic value per atom, I can use our best understanding of physics today to estimate such limits.

Strong security might allow high median income in the nations that limit population, but that would not assure the global median remained high.

On your capital argument, I think you need to learn more econ growth theory. 

Your meme argument would apply to any non-meme-pushing use of resources whatsoever.  And why can't having kids be a good way to push memes?
