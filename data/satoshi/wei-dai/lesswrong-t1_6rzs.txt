The philosophical thinking is usually done in terms of the concepts that are later found irrelevant (or which are known to be irrelevant to begin with). What I object to is philosopher's arrogance in form of gross overestimate of the relevance of the philosophical 'problems' and philosophical 'solutions' to anything.

If the philosophical notion of causality has a problem with abstracting away irrelevant low level details of the method of control of a manipulator, that is a problem with philosophical notion of causality, not a problem with the design of intelligent systems. Philosophy seems to be an incredibly difficult to avoid failure mode of intelligences - whereby the intelligence fails to establish relevant concepts and proceeds to reason in terms of faulty concepts.
