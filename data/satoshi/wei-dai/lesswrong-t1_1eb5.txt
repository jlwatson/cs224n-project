Argument 2.  Bayes' Law doesn't lie.

I'm wondering about your reasons for posting a straightforward probability question (as a top-level post rather than an Open Thread comment, no less).  Are you trying to take a reading of how competent the average LW contributor currently is on trivial questions?  Are you setting up a real-world problem analogous to this, where most people get the wrong answer?  Or is it something else entirely?
