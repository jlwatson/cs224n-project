I disagree with Wei Dai on all points in the parent and find his misrepresentation of me abhorrent (even though he is quite likely to be sincere). I hope that Wei Dai's ability to persuade others of his particular mind-reading conclusion is limited. My most practical course of action---and the one I will choose to take---seems to be that of harm minimisation. I will not engage with---or, in particular, defend myself against---challenges by Wei Dai beyond a one sentence reply per thread if that happens to be necessary. 

&gt; I feel like I should at least indicate to others that there is significant disagreement

I have been making this point from the start. That which Wei Dai chooses to most actively and strongly defend tends to be things that are bad for the site (see the aggressive encouragement of certain kinds of 'contrarians' in particular). I also acknowledged that Wei Dai's perspective would almost certainly be the reverse.
