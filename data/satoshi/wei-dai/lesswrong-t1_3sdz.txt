I have similar misgivings, they prompted me to write the post. Fighting fire with fire looks like a dangerous idea. The problem statement should look like "how do we stop unfriendly AIs", not "how do we make friendly AIs". Many people here (e.g. Nesov and SarahC) seem convinced that the latter is the most efficient way of achieving the former. I hope we can find a better way if we think some more.
