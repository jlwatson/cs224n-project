Can I plug Wikimedia at this point? As I've noted, that's more analogous to a software project than an ordinary charity - your money is useful and most welcomed, but the real contribution is your *knowledge*.

(Then we need to fix the things wrong with the editor experience on Wikipedia ... though the Wikimedia Foundation is paying serious attention to that as well of late.)

Or, more generally: create educational material under a [free content licence](http://freedomdefined.org/Definition). If it's CC-by-sa, CC-by or PD, it can interbreed.

I suggest you make your comment a discussion post.
