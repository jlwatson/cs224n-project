I think that is a dangerous anti-epistemic meme. (Especially since calling the process of determining our values "assigning value to things" is misleading, though I get what you mean.)  You use the art of rationality to determine what you value, and you use the art of rationality to determine how you should reflect on or change the process of determining what you value. Instrumental and epistemic rationality do not decouple nearly so easily.
