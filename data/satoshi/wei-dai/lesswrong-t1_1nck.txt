Subjective anticipation is a concept that a lot of people rest their axiology on. But it looks like subjective anticipation is an artefact of our cognitive algorithms, and all kinds of Big world theories break it. For example, MW QM means that subjective anticipation is nonsense. 

Personally, I find this extremely problematic, and in practise, I think that I am just ignoring it.
