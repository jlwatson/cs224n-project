I guess one difference between us is that I don't see anything particularly 'wrong' with using stipulative definitions as long as you're aware that they don't match the intended meaning (that we don't have access to yet), whereas you like to characterize stipulative definitions as 'wrong' when they don't match the intended meaning.

But perhaps I should add one post before my empathic metaethics post which stresses that the stipulative definitions of 'austere metaethics' don't match the intended meaning - and we can make this point by using all the standard thought experiments that deontologists and utilitarians and virtue ethicists and contractarian theorists use against each other.
