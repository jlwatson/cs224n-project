He gave a lower bound, sufficient to motivate the view that we should not seek stagnation, which is what he seems to be talking about there. Why interpret a lower bound (when this is all that is needed to establish the point, and less controversial) which is "easy" into a near-upper-bound?  

Stagnation on Earth means astronomical waste almost exactly as much as near-term extinction (and also cuts us off from very high standards of living that might be achieved). Holden is saying that the conclusion that growth with plausible risk levels beats permanent stagnation is robust. Talking about 100:1 tradeoffs would be less robust.
