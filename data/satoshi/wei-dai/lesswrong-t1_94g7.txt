I agree that people say such things all the time. What I haven't seen very much is

* People questioning whether *they themselves* are subject to this influence (as opposed to questioning whether *other people* are subject to this influence).
* Meta-level discussion about how to counteract this influence.

On the latter point, I find certain principles from your [How To Actually Change Your Mind](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind) sequence to be highly relevant and significant, but I don't remember having seen explicit application of these principles to "assessing the relative social impact of different effective altruism interventions" in the public domain.
