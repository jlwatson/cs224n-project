When I first found this site, I read through all the OB posts chronologically, rather than reading the Sequences as sequences. So I got to see the history of several commenters, many of whom disagreed sharply with EY, with their disagreement evolving over several posts. 

They tend to wander off after a while. Which is not surprising, as there is very little reward for it.

So I guess I'd ask this a different way: if you were an ethical philosopher whose positions disagreed with EY, what in this community would _encourage_ you to post (or comment) about your disagreements?
