(I am not satisfied with the state of discourse on this question (to be specific, I don't think MIRI proponents have adequately addressed concerns like those expressed by Wei Dai here and elsewhere), so I don't want to be seen as endorsing what might naively seem to be the immediate policy-relevant implications of this argument, but:) Bla bla philosophical problems once solved are no longer considered philosophical bla bla \[this part of the argument is repeated ad nauseam and is universally overstated\], and then [this](http://lesswrong.com/lw/fj4/what_does_the_world_look_like_the_day_before_fai/7uhd?context=1#comments). Steve's comment also links to quite similar arguments made by Luke Muehlhauser. Also it links to one of Wei Dai's previous posts closely related to this question.

Wei Dai, I noticed on the MIRI website that you're slotted to appear at some future MIRI workshop. I find this a little bit strangeâ€”given your reservations, aren't you worried about throwing fuel on the fire?
