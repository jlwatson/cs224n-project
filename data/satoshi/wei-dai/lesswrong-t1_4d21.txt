Humans are also incomplete in this sense. We already have no way of capturing the whole problem statement. The goal is to capture it as well as possible using some reflective trick of looking at our own brains or behavior, which is probably way better than what an upload singleton that doesn't build a FAI is capable of.

If there are uploads, they could be handed the task of solving the problem of FAI in the same sense in which we try to, but this doesn't get us any closer to the solution. There should probably be a charity dedicated to designing upload-based singletons as a kind of high-impact applied normative ethics effort (and SIAI might want to spawn one, since rational thinking about morality is important for this task; we don't want fatalistic acceptance of a possible Malthusian dystopia or unchecked moral drift), but this is not the same problem as FAI.
