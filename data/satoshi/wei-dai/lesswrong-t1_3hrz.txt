I'm saying that the "confusion-extinguishing" heuristic is a better one for identifying good answers to philosophical questions, as judged by me, and probably as judged by you as well.

Also that, given the topic matter, truth may be undecidable for some questions (owing to the process by which philosophers arrived at them), in which case you'd want the confusion-extinguishing answer anyway.
