&gt;I still disagree with this.

You disagree with the statement that we *can*, or you disagree with the implication that we *should*?

&gt;Why would you do that instead of 2?

In practice, I don't think you would need to. The point of the theorem is that you always can if you want to, and I'm not sure why this result is interesting to Nisan. 

(Note also that this approach works for other metaethical approaches besides NBS/KSBS, and that you don't always have access to NBS/KSBS.)
