&gt; Why do you think it's tougher to tackle than other human biases?

The default reaction my brain (and so, generalizing from one example, I expect other brains on LW too) has to this whole program of overcoming biases is "oh cool! I'm the kind of person who overcomes biases now! That makes me so much better than all those other biased people." Successfully overcoming other biases actually makes this one a little worse. But I think I'm [okay with this one](http://lesswrong.com/lw/g0e/narrative_selfimage_and_selfcommunication/) as long as I'm using it to motivate myself.
