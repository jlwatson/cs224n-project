I think this paper offers an object lesson in [taking ideas seriously](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2l6/taking_ideas_seriously/). I mean I thought I had taken the idea of uploads seriously, but apparently not and neither had anyone else. The conclusions reached in the paper do not seem to require really deep insight or information that is difficult to gather or process. Instead they seem like the obvious conclusions that anyone would reach if they just thought seriously about what would really happen once uploads became possible.

(Of course "obvious conclusions that anyone would reach if ..." is an exaggeration, but I think you get my point. :)
