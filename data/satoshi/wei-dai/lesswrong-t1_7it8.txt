&gt; I recently thot about Courage, and the fact that most people are too afraid of risk (beyond just utility concavity), and as a heuristic we should be failing more.

This instinct may be related to [The Fear of Common Knowledge](http://lesswrong.com/lw/s1/the_fear_of_common_knowledge/). We seem afraid to attempt things that can provide common knowledge of what our ability levels are. In other words, if I only try things that are safe, or are so challenging that I can't reasonably expect to succeed anyway, then nobody including myself has to acknowledge just how dumb, or untalented, or ignorant I am. But if I try and fail at something that's only somewhat challenging, then things become *awkward*.
