Come to think of it, the problem with this argument is that  it assumes that my brain can *compute* the utility it assigns. But if it's assigning utility according to Kolmogorov complexity (effectively the proposal in the post), that's impossible. 

The same issue arises with having *probability* depend on complexity.
