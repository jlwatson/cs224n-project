You realize I'm arguing *against* do()-based causality?  If not, I was very much unclearer than I thought.

I have never tried to reduce causal arrows to similarity; Barbour does, I don't.  I take causality to be, or be the epistemic conjugate of, something physical and real which was involved in manufacturing this oddly-well-modeled-by-causality universe that we actually live in.  They are presently primitive in my model; I have not yet reduced them, except in the obvious sense that they are also formal mathematical relations between points, i.e., causal relations are a special case of logical relations (and yet we still live in a causal universe rather than a merely logical one).  I do indeed reduce consciousness to computation and computation to causality, though there's a step here involving magical reality-fluid about which I am still confused - I have no idea why or what it means for a causal process to be more or less real, either as a result of having more or less Born measure, being instantiated in many places, or for any other reason.
