There seems to be a number of different possible approaches to building a Friendly AI, each with their own open problems. For example, we could design a system of uploads with safety checks and then punt all other questions to them, or figure out how we solve confusing philosophical problems and program a de novo AI with those methods, or solve them ourselves and just code up a decision process together with a set of preferences. Does this effort to define open problems assume a particular approach?
