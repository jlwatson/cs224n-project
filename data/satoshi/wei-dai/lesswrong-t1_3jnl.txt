I agree with that, but feel that they don't shift by very much. And when they do shift, the causality might well run in the other direction: sometimes we change our professed morality to justify our preferred actions. And most of our actions are caused by reasons other than our current professed morality anyway, so it's not likely to play a large role in the preferences that CEV will infer from us.
