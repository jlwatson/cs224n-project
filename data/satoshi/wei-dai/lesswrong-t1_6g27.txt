&gt;The AGI community has ignored it, not because it is indisputable, but because people have not bothered to criticize it.

Here's Bill Hibbard [criticizing](http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/g/SIAI_CV_critique.html) FAI, and Ben Goertzel [doing the same](http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/08/17/does-humanity-need-an-ai-nanny/), and [Shane Legg](http://www.vetta.org/2006/09/unprovability-of-friendly-ai/). Surely Pei would consider all of these people to be part of the AGI community? Perhaps Pei means that *most* of the AGI community has not bothered to criticize FAI, but then most of the AGI community has not bothered to criticize any particular AGI proposal, including his own NARS.

Does anyone see any other interpretation, besides that Pei is just mistaken about this?
