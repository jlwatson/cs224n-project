I think that Facebook's behavior has probably gotten worse over time as part of general move towards cashing in / monetizing.

I don't think I've looked at my feed in a few years.

On the original point: I think at equilibrium services like Facebook maximize total welfare, then take their cut in a socially efficient way (e.g. as payment). I think the only question is how long it takes to get there.
