I dislike the discussion/main section divide. I have to check two places for recent comments/posts. Plus, every time I want to make a post I have to decide which section to post it in, and that seems to be a not insignificant mental cost. Actually I can't really tell which posts belong where, so I've ended up posting all of them in discussion "to be safe".
