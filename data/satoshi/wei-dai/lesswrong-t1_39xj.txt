This is one of the issues where LW potentially disagrees with the rest of humanity, and I think the LW position (or at least the position you articulate) is actually wrong. I see many object-level ways to help the world once we have a magical optimizer: solve protein folding, model plasma containment, etc. And these are just the opportunities we can take advantage of with existing tech, but the optimizer can also help design new tech.
