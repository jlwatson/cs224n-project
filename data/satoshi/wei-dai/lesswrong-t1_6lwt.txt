The primary point of my comment was to argue that an agent that has a goal in the strong sense would not abandon its goal as a result of philosophical consideration. Your response seems more directed at my afterthought about how our intuitions based on human experience would cause us to miss the primary point.

I think that we humans do have goals, despite not being able to consistantly pursue them. I want myself and my fellow humans to continue our subjective experiences of life in enjoyable ways, without modifying what we enjoy. This includes connections to other people, novel experiences, high challenge, etc. There is, of course, much work to be done to complete this list and fully define all the high level concepts, but in the end I think there are real goals there, which I would like to be embodied in a powerful agent that actually runs a coherent decision theory. Philosophy probably has to play some role in clarifying our "pseudo-goals" as actual goals, but so does looking at our "pseudo-goals", however arbitrary they may be.
