The general "goal" of this system is to make sure the world is controlled by the decisions of the program produced by the initial program, so the simulation of the initial program and yielding of control to its output are subgoals of that. I don't see how to make that work, but I don't see why it can't be done either. The default problems of AGI instrumental drives get siphoned off into the possible initial destructiveness (but don't persist later), and the problem of figuring out human values gets delegated to the humans inside the initial program (which is the part that seems potentially much harder to solve pre-WBE than whatever broadly goal-independent decision theory is needed to make this plan well-defined).

This seems to me like the third plausible winning plan, the other two being (1) figuring out and implementing pre-WBE FAI and (2) making sure the WBE shift (which shouldn't be hardware-limited for the first-runner advantage to be sufficient) is dominated by a FAI project. Unless this somehow turns out to be FAI-complete (which is probable, given that almost any plan is), it seems strictly easier than pre-WBE FAI, although it has a significant cost of possibly initially destroying the current world, which is the problem that the other two plans don't (by default) have.
