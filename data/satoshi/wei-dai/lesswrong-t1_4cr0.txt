I don't feel there is a need for that. You just present these things as tools, not fundamental ideas, also discussing why they are not fundamental and why figuring out fundamental ideas is important. The relevant lesson is along the lines of [Fake Utility Functions](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lq/fake_utility_functions/) (the post has "utility function" in it, but it doesn't seem to need to), applied more broadly to epistemology.
