If you aren't afraid of making mistakes you can learn and grow MUCH faster than if you are.  

If you aren't afraid of noticing when you have made mistakes you can learn and grow MUCH MUCH faster than if you are.  

The main thing though is that once you have learned an average amount the more you learn the less typical your thought patterns will be.  If you bother to learn a lot your thought patterns will be VERY atypical.  Once this happens, it becomes wildly unlikely that anyone talking with you for more than a minute without feedback will still be saying anything useful.  Only conversation provides rapid enough feedback to make most of what the other person says relevant. (think how irrelevant most of the info in a typical pop-science book is because you can't indicate to the author every ten seconds that you understand and that they can move on to the next point)
