How do we choose between different proposals for "exploration"? For example the workshops that MIRI is currently hosting on a regular basis seem to be designed largely to learn how to most efficiently produce FAI-related research as well as how productive such research efforts can currently be. On the other hand, I suggest that at this stage we should devote more resources into what I call "Singularity Strategies" research, to better understand for example whether pushing for "FAI first" has positive or negative expected impact. I think both of these activities can plausibly be called "exploration". Peter, do you agree and if so, have you thought about how to choose between them?

(BTW, I'm planning to attend one of the MIRI workshops in September, which is mainly due to my intellectual curiosity about the topic and not meant to indicate that I endorse MIRI's approach as far as getting the best long term outcome.)
