So, in the spirit of stupid (but nagging) questions:

The sequences present a convincing case (to me at least) that MWI is the right view of things, and that it is the best conclusion of our understanding of physics. Yet I don't believe it, because it seems to be in direct conflict with the fact of ethics: if all I can do is push the badness out of my path, and into some other path, then I can't see how doing good things matters. I can't change the fundamental amount of goodness, I can just push it around. Yet it matters that I'm good and not bad.

The 'keep your own path clean' answer is very unsatisfying, just because it doesn't work anywhere else. I can't just keep my own family, neighborhood, city, country, or planet clean. I can't even just decide to keep my own temporal chunk of the universe clean, while ignoring the rest and even at the expense of the rest of it. Why should this principle suddenly work in the case of other worlds? It seems ad hoc.

So my stupid question is this: why aren't MWI and ethics just flatly in conflict?
