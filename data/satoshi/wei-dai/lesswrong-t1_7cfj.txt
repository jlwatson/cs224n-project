&gt;"Personal is Political" 

I very much think the personal should *not* be the political. Because such a mentality when adopted by a society results in:

1. Tribalization of more and more of the human experience. Making it [harder and harder](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Politics_is_the_Mind-Killer) to think about more and more things. 
2. Apolitical [identities](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) or [outlooks](http://lesswrong.com/lw/cz7/conspiracy_theories_as_agency_fictions/6st2) are harder if not impossible to maintain. 
3. Opening up areas to new kinds of remarkably damaging rent seeking.  

Thus ceteris paribus it makes life in such a society suck more.
