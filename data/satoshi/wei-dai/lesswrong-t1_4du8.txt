Fashion is the intersection of social skills and aesthetics as applied to clothing. Fashion and style matter for the same reason that social skills and aesthetics matter. Lukeprog gave a good summary of how people will rationally make judgments about you based on your appearance. 

You can't "opt out" of fashion anymore that you can opt out of web design. There is a reason why the web no longer looks like [this](http://www.indiana.edu/~ensiweb/). Regardless of whether clothing is a zero-sum game, it's a pervasive enough game that trying to opt out doesn't let you escape: it just makes you lose.
