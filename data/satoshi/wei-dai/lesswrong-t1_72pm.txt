I would have thought it obvious that I was talking about lawyers who have been developing law for at least a millenium, not merely currently living lawyers in one particular country.  Oh well.

Since my posts seem to be being read so carelessly, I will no longer be posting on this thread.  I highly recommend folks who want to learn more about where I'm coming from to visit my blog, Unenumerated.  Also, to learn more about the evolutionary emergence of ethical and legal rules, I highly recommend Hayek -- _Fatal Conceit_ makes a good startng point.
