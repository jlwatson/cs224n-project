I read it as a different question: what is bad about pain vs. what is the nature of pain's badness. The first question is about describing the ways in which pain isn't optimal, how its properties could be changed to improve the result (like a naive suggestion to completely eliminate it, which turns out to be a worse option). The second question is about what features in particular make people characterize pain on the bad side of things. It's a less constructive question, it considers specifically the current implementation rather than how its role could be better played by something else.
