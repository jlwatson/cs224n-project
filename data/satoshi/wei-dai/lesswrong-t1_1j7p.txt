I can't get all that much more explicit. It's near the level of raw logic and the 'conclusion you suggest' is included as a direct quote in case there was any doubt. Let's see.

**A** *I don't want to be a really big integer!*  
**B** *If you had to choose between being a really big integer and a really big negative integer, you'd be pretty much indifferent.*

**B** is not implied by **A**.


I would have replaced my (grandparent) comment with the phrase '*non sequitur*' except I wanted to acknowledge that Wei_Dai is almost certainly considering related issues beyond the conclusion he actually offered.
