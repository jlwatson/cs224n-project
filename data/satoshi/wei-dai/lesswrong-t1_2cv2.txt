Wei Dai has [cast some doubts](http://www.sl4.org/archive/0711/17101.html) on the AI-based approach

&gt;Assuming that it is unlikely we will obtain fully satisfactory answers to all of the  questions before the Singularity occurs, does it really make sense to pursue an AI-based approach? 

I am curious if he has "another approach" he wrote about; I am not brushed up on sl4/ob/lw prehistory.

Personally I have some interest in increasing intelligence capability on individual level via "tools of thought" kind of approach, BCI in the limit. There is not much discussion of it here.
