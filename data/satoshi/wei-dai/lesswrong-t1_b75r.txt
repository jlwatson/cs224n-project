&gt; If you think these are merely six of countless hypotheses, do you think you could come up with, say, two more?

Two more possible positions: 

- There is a great variety of possible consistent preferences that intelligent beings can have, and there are no facts about what one should value that apply to all possible intelligent beings. However, there are still facts about rationality that do apply to all intelligent beings.  Also, if you narrow the scope from "intelligent beings" to "humans", most humans , when consistent, share similar preferences, and there exist facts about what they should value. (So, 4 or 5 for intelligent beings in general, but 1 for humans.)

- Morality has nothing to do with value.
