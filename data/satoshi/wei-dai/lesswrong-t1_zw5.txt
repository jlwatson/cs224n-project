What is the difference between two (interacting) nodes controlling their own resources and (instead of them) one distributed node controlling the resources? What do you mean by "control"? What is gained by calling basically the same thing "one node" and not "two nodes"? If the important part is "agreed-upon", how does it work in terms of the two interacting processes, and how to translate it in a statement about the joint process?
