&gt; That's interesting. May I ask in what capacity?

Father of four, teach a programming class to some kids in my area, attend many social gatherings full of kids.

&gt; What if you restrict YouTube, then give them enough free time to get bored of their toys and "generally being annoying"?

YMMV, but I haven't seen much progress happening as a result of boredom. As a child I was in this situation and spent most of my time pointlessly reading fiction. Got serious about math and programming only due to having amazing teachers in high school (actual math and CS researchers).

On the other hand, if you're asking about your kids, maybe they'll turn out like you and get interested in stuff naturally :-)

&gt; What are verbally focused activities? Like competitive debating?

At preschool level it's games like broken telephone or I Spy. At school level I'm not sure, but I feel that my verbal abilities are low because I never did anything like debating in my teens.
