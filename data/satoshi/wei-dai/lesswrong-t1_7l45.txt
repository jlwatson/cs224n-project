There are people on this site whose thinking I respect enough that, were they to say something of this sort to me, I would at least acknowledge that I _ought_ to re-evaluate the process that got me to where I am, despite their having not much intimate knowledge about me. (There are also people in my real life who have that property.)

Whether I would actually _do_ it is a much more complicated and contingent question.
