So, the situation is somewhat different than the one that you describe. Some points of clarification.

•I first came across Overcoming Bias in 2008. Eliezer was recommended to me by a friend who I respect a great deal. My reactions to the first postings that I read by Eliezer was strong discomfort with his apparent grandiosity and self absorption. This discomfort was sufficiently strong for me to lose interest despite my friend's endorsement.

•I started reading Less Wrong in earnest in the beginning of 2010. This made it clear to me that Eliezer has a lot to offer and that it was unfortunate that I had been pushed away by my initial reaction.

•I never assigned a very high probability to Eliezer making a crucial contribution to an FAI research project. My thinking was that the enormous positive outcome associated with success might be sufficiently great to justify the project despite the small probability.

•I didn't get much of a chance to correspond privately with Eliezer at all. He responded to a couple of my messages with one line dismissive responses and then stopped responding to my subsequent messages. Naturally this lowered the probability that I assigned to being able to collaborating with him. This also lowered my confidence in his ability to attract collaborators in general.

•If Eliezer showed strong ability to attract and work well with collaborators (including elite academics who are working on artificial intelligence research) then I would find it several orders of magnitude more likely that he would make a crucial contribution to an FAI research project. For concreteness I'll throw out the number 10^(-6).

•I feel that the world is very complicated and that randomness plays a very large role. This leads me to assign a very small probability to the proposition that _any_ given individual will play a crucial role in eliminating existential risk. 

•I freely acknowledge that I may be influenced by emotional factors. I make an honest effort at being level headed and sober but as I mention elsewhere, my experience posting on Less Wrong has been emotionally draining. I find that I become substantially less rational when people assume that my motives are impure (some sort of self fulfilling prophesy). 

You may notice that of my last four posts, the first pair was considerably more impartial than the second pair. (This is reflected in the fact that the first pair was upvoted more than the second pair.) My subjective perception is that I started out thinking quite carefully and became less rational as I read and responded to hostile commentators.
