You're getting downvoted for overconfidence, not for the content of your point of view.

The utilitarian point of view is that beyond some level of salary, more money has very small marginal utility to an average First World citizen, but would have a huge direct impact in utility on people who are starving in poor countries.

Your point is that the indirect impacts should also be considered, and that perhaps when they are taken into account the net utility increase isn't so clear. The main indirect impact you identify is increasing dependency on the part of the recipients.

Your concern for the autonomy of these starving people is splendid, but the fact remains that without aid their lives will be full of suffering. Your position appears to be "good riddance". You can't fault people for being offended at the implied lack of compassion.

I suspect that your appeal for sympathy towards your position is doubly likely to fall on deaf ears as a result. Losing two karma points isn't the end of the world, and does not constitute suppression. Stop complaining, and invest some effort in presenting your points of view more persuasively.
