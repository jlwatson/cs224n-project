Depends on what would satisfy us, I suppose.

I mean, for example, if it turns out that implementing CEV creates a future that everyone living in desires and is made happy and fulfilled and satisfied by and continues to do so indefinitely, and that everyone living now would if informed of the details of also desire and etc., but we are never able to confirm that any of that is right... or worse yet, later philosophical analysis somehow reveals that it _isn't_ right, despite being desirable and fulfilling and satisfying and so forth... well, OK, we can decide at that time whether we want to give up what is desirable and etc. in exchange for what is right, but in the meantime I might well be satisfied by that result. Maybe it's OK to leave future generations some important tasks to implement.

Or, if it turns out that EY's approach is all wrong because nobody agrees on anything important to anyone, so that extrapolating humanity's coherent volition leaves out everything that's important to everyone, so that implementing it doesn't do anything important... in that case, coming up with an alternate plan that has results as above would satisfy me. 

Etc.
