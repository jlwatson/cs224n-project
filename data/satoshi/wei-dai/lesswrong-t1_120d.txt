In this zero-sum game, yes, it's possible that whoever has the most computing power wins, if neither can access unpredictable random or private variables.  But what if both sides have exactly equal computing power?  We could define a Timeless Paper-Scissors-Rock Tournament this way - standard language, no random function, each program gets access to the other's source code and exactly 100 million ticks, if you halt without outputting a move then you lose 2 points.
