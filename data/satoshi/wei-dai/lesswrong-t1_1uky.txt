One could say that most of math is already about uncertainty: when you have a system and ways of refining it, it is in a way a form of applying knowledge to resolve uncertainty. For example, applying a function to a parameter, or combining morphisms. A lot of analysis is about approximation or representing systems that expect future observations. It is a very narrow sense of "dealing with uncertainty" that would require going to the fringe.
