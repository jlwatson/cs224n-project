I'd have to disagree with that.  It's a far-future science example and an obvious default one given the current model of physics for anyone who understands thermodynamics.  Okay, it may take some explaining before it's equally obvious to everyone, but it is, in fact, obvious.  Especially if you want value that scales nonlinearly with material.  I find it difficult to put into mere words just how obvious this is - it far exceeds the obviousness of, say, using gold to talk about inflation, when the choice of those particular atoms is completely arbitrary in a grand physical sense.
