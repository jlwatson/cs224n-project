Wanting cryo signals disloyalty to your present allies. 

Women, it seems, are especially sensitive to this (mothers, wives). Here's my explanation for why:

1. Women are better than men at analyzing the social-signalling theory of actions. In fact, they (mostly) obsess about that kind of thing, e.g. watching soap operas, gossiping, people watching, etc.  (disclaimer: on average)

2. They are less rational than men (only slightly, on average), and this is compounded by the fact that they are less knowledgeable about technical things (disclaimer: on average), especially physics, computer science, etc. 

3. Women are more bound by social convention and less able to be lone dissenters. Asch's conformity experiment found women to be more conforming. 

4. Because of (2) and (3), women find it harder than men to take cryo seriously. Therefore, they are much more likely to think that it is not a feasible thing for *them* to do

5. Because they are so into analyzing social signalling, they focus in on what cryo signals about a person. Overwhelmingly: selfishness, and as they don't think they're going with you, betrayal.
