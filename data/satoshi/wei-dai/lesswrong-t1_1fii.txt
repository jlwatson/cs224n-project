&gt;which makes me wonder, where are the teenage would-be rationalists hanging out today? There seem to be fewer of them here than I would have expected.

I think it's plausible that the majority of teen LW readers stay silent, simply because they are more likely to be intimidated by the quality of the discussion, and more likely to think they cannot make a valuable comment. 

At least, I'm a teenage reader and the above mentioned things describe my attitude. I suspect though that it applies to others too.
