General policy. For example, if Wei Dai chooses the wirehead route, I might think he's missing out on a lot of other things life has to offer, but that doesn't give me the right to forcibly unwirehead him, any more than he has the right to do the reverse to me.

In other words, he and I have two separate disagreements: of value axioms, whether there should be more to life than wireheading (which is a matter of personal preference), and of moral axioms, whether it's okay to initiate the use of armed force (whether in person or by proxy) to impose one's preferred lifestyle on another (which is a matter of general policy). (And this serves as a nice pair of counterexamples to the theory I have seen floating around that there is a universal set of human values.)

In cases of extreme mental disability, we don't have an entity that is inherently capable of giving informed consent, so indeed it's not possible to apply that criterion. In that case (given the technology to do so) it would be necessary to intervene to repair the disability before the criterion can begin to apply.
