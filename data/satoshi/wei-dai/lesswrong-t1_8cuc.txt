&gt;I don't think this works for your post, because ...

Ooops. I suppose to patch that, we have to postulate that we at least believe that we live in a world where a wizard turning you into a whale is normal enough that you don't totally re-evaluate everything you believe about reality, but rare enough that it would be pretty awesome.

Thanks for catching that. I can't believe I missed it.

&gt;What about, for example, Brian Tomasik, who thinks his morality mostly has to do with reducing the amount of negative hedons in the universe (rather than whales and starships)?

I would put that guy in the "needs awesomeism" crowd, but maybe he would disagree, and I have no interest in pushing it.

I don't much like his "morality as hostile meme-warfare" idea either. In fact, I disagree with almost everything in that post.

Last night, someone convinced me to continue on this writing trend that the OP is a part of, and end up with a sane attack, or at least scouting mission, on moral philosophy and CEV or CEV-like strategies. I do have some ideas that haven't been discussed around here, and a competent co-philosopher, so if I can merely stay on the rails (very hard), it should be interesting.

EDIT: And thanks a lot for your critical feedback; it's really helpful given that so few other people come up with useful competent criticism.
