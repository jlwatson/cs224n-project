Is it just me, or do Luke and Eliezer's initial responses appear to send the wrong signals? From the perspective of an SI critic, [Luke's comment](http://lesswrong.com/lw/cbs/thoughts_on_the_singularity_institute_si/6jzn) could be interpreted as saying "for us, not being completely incompetent is worth bragging about", and [Eliezer's](http://lesswrong.com/lw/cbs/thoughts_on_the_singularity_institute_si/6k1b) as "we're so arrogant that we've only taken two critics (including Holden) seriously in our entire history". These responses seem *suboptimal*, given that Holden *just* complained about SI's lack of impressive accomplishments, and being too selective about whose feedback to take seriously.
