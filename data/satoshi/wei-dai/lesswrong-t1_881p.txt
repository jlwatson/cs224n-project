What I gather is that the real question here isn't so much "First or second order logic?", but "Is it sensible to try to convey/instill the idea of 'largest powerset' to/in an AI, and if so how?" "Largest powerset" seems both meaningful and simple (for the purpose of applying Occam's razor), but we don't know how to capture its meaning using syntactic proof rules (or rather, we know that we can't). Maybe we can capture the meaning some other way, for example in the form of a "math intuition module" that can arrive at "probabilistic" conclusions about mathematical structures that are defined in part by "largest powerset"?
