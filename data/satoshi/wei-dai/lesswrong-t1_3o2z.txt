I'm not so sure.

Academics always have far more to read than they have time to read. Only reading stuff that has passed peer review is a useful filter. They might be curious enough to begin reading, say, the CEV article from 2004, but after going just a short distance and encountering the kinds of terminology issues I described above, they might not keep reading.

I'm imagining that they, for example, realize that Eliezer is proposing what is called an 'idealized preference' theory of value, but does not cite or respond to *any* of the many objections that have been raised against such theories, and so they doubt that reading further will be enlightening. They're wrong - though it *would* be nice to hear if Eliezer has a solution to the standard objections to idealized preference theories - but I sympathize with academics who need a strong filter in order to survive, even if it means they'll miss out on a few great things.
