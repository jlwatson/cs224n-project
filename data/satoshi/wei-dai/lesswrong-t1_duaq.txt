Huh, I feel very differently. For AI risk specifically, I thought the conventional wisdom was always "if AI goes wrong, the most likely outcome is that we'll all just die, and the next most likely outcome is that we get a future which [somehow goes against our values even if it makes us very happy](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xu/failed_utopia_42/)." And besides AI risk, other x-risks haven't really been discussed at all on LW. I don't recall seeing any argument for s-risks being a particularly plausible category of risks, let alone one of the most important ones.

It's true that there was That One Scandal, but the reaction to that was quite literally Let's Never Talk About This Again - or alternatively Let's Keep Bringing This Up To Complain About How It Was Handled, depending on the person in question - but then people always only seemed to be talking about that specific incident and argument. I never saw anyone draw the conclusion that "hey, this looks like an important subcategory of x-risks that warrants separate investigation and dedicated work to avoid".
