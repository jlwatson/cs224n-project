I'd like to see a more scientific study of what are the real triggers of the ick/"I'm offended" reaction. Perhaps collect all of the instances of comments that caused it and compare with a representative sample of non-icky/offensive comments?

The hypotheses I've seen so far are:

* to be thought of, talked about as, or treated like a non-person (Alicorn)
* analysis of behavior that puts the reader in the group being analyzed, and the speaker outside it (orthonormal)
* exclusion from the intended audience (Eliezer)

&gt; Then just keep on accepting suggested edits.

Doesn't that assume that whoever suggested the edits knows what's really causing the ick/offense, which you just pointed out may not be the case?
