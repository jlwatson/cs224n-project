Why to accept an inductive principle:

1. Finite agents *have* to accept an "inductive-ish" principle, because they can't even process the infinitely many consistent theories which are longer than the number of computations they have in which to compute, and therefore they can't even directly consider most of the long theories.  Zooming out and viewing from the macro, this is extremely inductive-ish, though it doesn't decide between two fairly short theories, like Christianity versus string theory.

2. Probabilities over all your hypotheses have to add to 1, and getting an extra bit of info allows you to rule out approximately half of the remaining consistent theories; therefore, your probability of a theory one bit longer being true ought to drop by that ratio.  If your language is binary, this has the nice property that you can assign a 1-length hypothesis a probability of 1/2, a 2-length hypothesis a probability of 1/4, ... an n -length hypothesis a probability of 1/(2^n)...and you notice that 1/2+1/4+1/8 + ... + ~= 1.  So the scheme fits pretty naturally.

3. Under [various assumptions](http://intelligence.org/blog/2007/06/25/solomonoff-induction/), an agent does only a constant factor worse using this induction assumption versus any other method, making this seem not only less than arbitrary, but arguably, "universal".

4. Ultimately, we could be wrong and our universe may not actually obey the Occam Prior.  It appears we don't and can't even in principle have a complete response to religionists who are using solipsistic arguments.  For example, there could be a demon making these bullet points seem reasonable to your brain, while they are in fact entirely untrue.  However, this does *not* appear to be a good reason not to use Occam's razor.

5. Related to (2)--you *can't* assign *equal* probability greater than 0 to each of the infinite number of theories consistent with your data, and still have your sums converge to 1 (because for any rational number R &gt; 0, the sum of an infinite number of R's will diverge).  So, you have to discount some hypotheses relative to others, and induction looks to be the simplest way to do this (One could say of the previous sentence, "meta-occam's razor supports occam's razor").  The burden of proof is on the religionist to propose a plausible alternative mapping, since the Occam mapping appears to satisy the fairly stringent desiderata.

6.  Further to (5), notice that to get the probability sum to converge to 1, and also to assign each of the infinite consistent hypotheses a probability greater than 0, *most* hypotheses need to have smaller probability than any fixed rational number.  In fact, you need more than that, you actually need the probabilities to drop pretty fast, since 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + .... + does not converge.  On the other hand, you COULD have certain instances where you switch two theories around in their probability assignments (for example, you could arbitrarily say Christianity was more likely than string theory, even though Christianity is a longer theory), but for *most* of the theories, with increasing length you MUST drop your probability down towards 0 relatively fast to maintain the desiderata at all.  To switch these probabilities only for particular theories you care about, while you also need and want to use the theory on other problems (including normal "common sense" intuitions, which are very well-explained by this framework), and you ALSO need to use it generally on *this* problem except for a few counter-examples you explicitly hard-code, seems incredibly contrived.  You're better off just to go with occam's razor, unless some better alternative can be proposed.
