&gt; It doesn't seem obviously crazy to provide information about the rationality benefits of some hobbies that would-be rationalist can take into account, along with other costs and benefits, while choosing hobbies.

I agree with your statement. The reasons for my criticism: a) it seems hard to determine objectively how much a given hobby helps your rationality, b) almost any hobby can be presented as "helping rationality" given enough ingenuity, c) some people will want to present their own hobbies this way. I'm not sure we can get much value from such discussions until we have some solution for at least one of these points.
