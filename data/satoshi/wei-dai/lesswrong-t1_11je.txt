And on the same note: was my comment about [state networks](http://lesswrong.com/lw/15m/towards_a_new_decision_theory/11h7) understandable? What do you think about that? I'd appreciate if people who have sufficient background to in principle understand a given comment but who are unable to do so due to insufficiently clear or incomplete explanation spoke up about that fact.
