Actually I'm not sure if any of that is a problem.  Spaun is quite literally "anthropomorphic" - modeled after a human brain.  So it's not much of a stretch to say that it learns and understands the way a human does.  I was just pointing out that the more progress we make on human-like AIs, without progress on brain scanning, the less likely a Hansonian singularity (dominated by ems of former humans) becomes.  If Spaun as it is now really does work "just like a human", then building a human-level AI is just a matter of speeding it up.  So by the time we have computers capable of supporting a human mind upload, we'll already have computer programs at least as smart as humans, which learn their knowledge on their own, with no need for a knowledge transplant from a human.
