This just bugs me too much.

No, I do not think there is disagreement. You tell many people that X is a largest member of the set. They come up with members that are larger than X. If they give different answers, that is not disagreement of some kind. If X is particularly ill chosen for being the largest member of the set, then there can be enormous number of members larger than X. 

If you want to claim substantial disagreement, e.g. if you claim that promoters of intelligence amplification see computer security as entirely unhelpful and a net increase in the risk, you got to provide examples (surely a sufficiently twisted reasoner can argue that computer security will be an annoying obstacle that will piss off the future cyborg overlord). edit: that's it, I think claiming that those who disagree are selling their examples as 'the best that could be done' is a bit of uncharitable interpretation (or actually, a lot). For the most part, it's just examples of what is better to do than FAI.
