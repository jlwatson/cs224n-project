Just to make sure there is no confusion about who stands where on the issue, I'd like to re-emphasize that I definitely don't support making politics a prominent item on the discussion agenda of LW. What I am concerned about are topics that are on LW's discussion agenda as presently defined, but have some implications about political and other charged issues, and the question of whether these should be avoided.  (Though of course this is complicated by the fact that the present discussion agenda is somewhat vague and a matter of some disagreement.)
