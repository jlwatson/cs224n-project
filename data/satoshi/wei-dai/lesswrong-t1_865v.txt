How come we never see anything physical that behaves like any of of the non-standard models of first order PA? Given that's the case, it seems like we can communicate the idea of numbers to other humans or even aliens by saying "the only model of first order PA that ever shows up in reality", so we don't *need* second order logic (or the other logical ideas mentioned in the comments) just to talk about the natural numbers?
