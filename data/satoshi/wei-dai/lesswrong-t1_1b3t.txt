Eh?  TDT was explained in enough detail for Dai and some others to get it.  It might not make sense to a lay audience but any philosophically competent fellow who's read the referenced books could reconstruct TDT out of [Ingredients of Timeless Decision Theory](http://lesswrong.com/lw/15z/ingredients_of_timeless_decision_theory/).

I don't understand your concept of "shipping".  There are many things I want to understand, some I understand already, a few of those that I've gone so far as to explain for the sake of people who are actually interested in them, and anything beyond that falls under the heading of PR and publicity.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but I find that no matter how much I do, the people who previously told me that I hadn't yet achieved it, find something else that I haven't yet achieved to focus on.  First it's "show you can invent something new", and then when you invent it, "show you can get it published in a journal", and if my priority schedule ever gets to the point I can do that, I have no doubt that the same sort of people will turn around and say "Anyone can publish a paper, where are the prominent scholars who support you?" and after that they will say "Does the whole field agree with you?"  I have no personal taste for any part of this endless sequence except the part where I actually figure something out.  TDT is rare in that I can talk about it openly and it looks like other people are actually making progress on it.
