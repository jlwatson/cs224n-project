Please review a draft of a Less Wrong post that I'm working on: [Complexity of Value != Complexity of Outcome](http://blog.weidai.com/2010/01/complexity-of-value-complexity-of.html), and let me know if there's anything I should fix or improve before posting it here. (You can save more substantive arguments/disagreements until I post it. Unless of course you think it completely destroys my argument so that I shouldn't even bother. :)
