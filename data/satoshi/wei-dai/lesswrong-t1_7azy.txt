&gt;You cannot rely on anyone else to argue you out of your mistakes; you cannot rely on anyone else to save you; you and only you are obligated to find the flaws in your positions; if you put that burden down, don't expect anyone else to pick it up.  And I wonder if that advice will turn out not to help most people, until they've personally blown off their own foot, saying to themselves all the while, correctly, "Clearly I'm winning this argument."
&gt;
&gt;Today I try not to take any human being as my opponent.  That just leads to overconfidence.  It is Nature that I am facing off against, who does not match Her problems to your skill, who is not obliged to offer you a fair chance to win in return for a diligent effort, who does not care if you are the best who ever lived, if you are not good enough.

I still rely on this crutch, and I'd be pretty curious to what other people do to get around it.  Trying to turn arguments into near-term predictions is the best technique I've got for not relying on other people to do my error checking.  But this doesn't work very well for normative questions, which is where I've found arguments with friends to be really helpful.  They're good at coming up with edge cases I haven't thought of or noticing where I'm not implementing the preference I've expressed.
