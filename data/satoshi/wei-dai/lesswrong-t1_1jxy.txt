Thank you for doing that, and may I second this.  I started reading those articles, then after a bit started scanning for the anti-realism articles, and worried after not finding them that I'd not read carefully enough, so I'm glad to have your report on this.

I really am curious to read these arguments, so I hope someone can point us to them.
