Personally, I didn't respond to this post because my reaction to it was mostly "yes, this is a problem, but I don't see a way by which talking about it will help at this point; we'll just have to wait and see". In other words, I feel that MIRI will just have to experiment with a lot of different strategies and see which ones look like they'll have promise, and then that experimentation will maybe reveal a way by which issues like this one can be solved, or maybe MIRI will end up pursuing an entirely different strategy. But I expect that we'll actually have to try out the different strategies before we can know.
