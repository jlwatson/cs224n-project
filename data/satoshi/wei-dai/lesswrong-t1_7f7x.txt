I think people overrate the prevalence of fundamental value difference as a way of protecting a bad map of human value.

I don't think we are anywhere near the point where fundamental value differences between men and women (or any other groups) are relevant.

Nobody wants to be oppressed, nobody wants to die, nobody wants to be hurt or sick, everybody wants more good friends, everybody wants more love, everybody wants to be more autonomous, etc etc.

To me, the point where fundamental value differences matter is when you've solved all of that and the biggest thing left to argue about is whose aesthetic sense the architecture should be optimized for.
