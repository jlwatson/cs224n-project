It’s critical to distinguish between ease/convenience and pleasure.

Absent conscious intervention, we don’t optimize for pleasure -- we optimize for a combination of pleasure and non-effort.  For example, TV is for many people easy to choose, and work and exercise are hard to choose, despite TV having low-average enjoyment ratings, exercise having average ratings, and work having high-average ratings (see e.g. [p. 243 of this book](http://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DjsZzPL217kC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;ots=l0MYYEESuG&amp;sig=BPSEgBRf_frKAtSnm1gdsaB5rZw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)).

Patri’s concept of “shiny/fun”, insofar as it is correct, seems to be about *low effort activities* more than about *high reward activities*.  To attain high personal growth, we need to learn to exert effort toward the highest-value learning and productivity tasks.  As Patri emphasizes, this involves learning to direct our attention, learning to resist shiny, low-effort distractions, and to get through relatively boring local drudge work when needed.  It does not, AFAICT, involve choosing less rewarding tasks on average; peak growth and productivity are often more rewarding (though also harder to choose) than clicking repeatedly on the “next comments” button.
