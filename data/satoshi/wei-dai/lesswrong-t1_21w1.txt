Woah, it took me a long time to parse "Smart Losers". The technical parts of the article seem to be correct, but as for its evolutional relevance... In your scenario, *being* smart doesn't hurt you, being *known* to be smart does; so it's most advantageous to be "secretly smart". So if your conclusions were correct, we'd probably see many adaptations aimed at concealing our intelligence from people we interact with.
