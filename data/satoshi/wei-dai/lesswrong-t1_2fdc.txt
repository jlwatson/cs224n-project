Crazy in which respect? It seemed to me that those critiques were narrow and mostly talking past Stross. The basic point that space is going to remain much more expensive and less pleasant than expansion on Earth for quite some time, *conditioning* on no major advances in AI, nanotechnology, biotechnology, etc, is perfectly reasonable. And Stross does so condition.

He has a few lines about it in The Singularity is Near, basically saying that FAI seems very hard (no foolproof solutions available, he says), but that AI will probably be well integrated. I don't think he means "uploads come first, and manage AI after that," as he predicts Turing-Test passing AIs well before uploads, but he has said things suggesting that those Turing Tests will be incomplete, with the AIs not capable of doing original AI research. Or he may mean that the ramp up in AI ability will be slow, and that IA will improve our ability to monitor and control AI systems institutionally, aided by non-FAI engineering of AI motivational systems and the like.
