&gt;We have ... preferences in terms of "our next experience." If we become convinced by the data that this model of a unique thread of experience is false, we then have problems in translating preferences defined in terms of that false model.

In what sense would I want to *translate* these preferences? Why wouldn't I just discard the preferences, and use the mind that came up with them to generate entirely new preferences in the light of its new, improved world-model? If I'm asking myself, as if for the first time, the question, "if there are going to be a lot of me-like things, how many me-like things with how good lives would be how valuable?", then the answer my brain gives is that it wants to use empathy and population ethics-type reasoning to answer that question, and that it feels no need to ever refer to "unique next experience" thinking. Is it making a mistake?
