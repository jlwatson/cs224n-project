&gt;I would argue that anthropic considerations should not move us on such logical facts.

Unless you move fully to UDT (which you don’t seem willing to do, at least for the purposes of this post), such a rule will lead you astray. Consider this thought experiment:

Omega appears and says that a minute ago he generated a physically random number R between 10^9 and 10^10, and if the R-th bit of π is 1, made 100 copies of Earth and scattered them throughout the universe. (He’s appearing to you in all 100 copies if that’s the case.) A minute from now, he will reveal R to you, and then you’ll be given an opportunity to bet $100 on the R-th bit of π being 1 at 1:1 odds.

What do you want your future self to do? If you apply SSA/SIA now, you would conclude that you’re likely to live in a universe where Omega made 100 copies of Earth, in other words a universe where the number R that Omega generated is such that the R-th bit of π is 1. So you have a greater expected utility if your future self were to take the bet.

But once you learn R, and if you follow the proposed rule, you’d become indifferent between taking the bet and not taking it, because whatever R turns out to be, you’d think that the R-th bit of π being 1 has probability .5, since that’s a reasonable prior and you’re not willing to let anthropic considerations move you on that purely logical fact.
