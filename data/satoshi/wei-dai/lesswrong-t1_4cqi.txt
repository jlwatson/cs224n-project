No fact alone can imply anything: true and important.  For example, a description of my brain at the neuronal level does not imply that I'm awake.  To get the implication, we need to add a definition (or at least some rule) of "awake" in neuronal terms.  And this definition will **not** capture the **meaning** of "awake."  We could ask, "given that a brain is &lt;insert neuronal definition here&gt;, is it awake?" and intuition will tell us that it is an open question.

But that is beside the point, if what we want to know is whether the definition succeeds.  The definition does not have to capture the *meaning* of "awake".  It only needs to get the reference correct.

Reduction doesn't typically involve capturing the meaning of the reduced terms - Is the (meta)ethical case special?  If so, why and how?
