This seems reasonable, but I have to ask about "correctly describes". The statement

"want to eat an apple" *implies* being in brain state ABC or computational state DEF (or something of that nature) 

is plausible to me. I think the reverse implication, though raises a problem:

being in brain state ABC or computational state DEF (or something of that nature) implies "want to eat an apple"

But maybe neither of these is what you have in mind?
