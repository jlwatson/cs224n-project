Parent is right: I wanted to extract some sort of concession or token act of reciprocity from him because I have been feeling that my efforts on LW are unappreciated. I considered extracting a promise that he would email me not more than 3 months from now and not less than 4 weeks from now with a report on where his work on RSVP has led, but I settled on, "first answer my questions, and then I will answer yours".

I have an intellectual commitment to trying to be helpful to people who are trying to improve the world and who are not destructive or irresponsible about it (e.g., who are not trial-and-erroring AGI designs) but lately I have been having trouble summoning the actual short-term motivation to do so. Either upvotes or some indication from the person I am trying to help that he considers me more than just an information-supplying machine whould probably have provided that short-term motivation in the present case.

It is no big deal because this period during which I do not feel sufficiently good about myself and my status to continue to attempt small thankless good deeds on the internet will probably pass in a few months. Alternatively I will replace thankless good deeds on the net with some other way for me to try to improve the world.

Speaking of thanks, I hereby thank wedrifid for his analysis. In my defense, I knew [the downvoted comment](http://lesswrong.com/lw/8ak/what_are_the_best_ways_of_absorbing_and/568o) was unsatisfactory, and I was in the process of rewriting it from scratch when I noticed I had accidentally posted it. 

I have PMed jimrandomh the information he wanted. (800 words of it.)  He is sincerely trying to improve the world and is doing so in a responsible non-destructive way, so I want to help him for some value of "want".
