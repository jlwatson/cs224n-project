The part about computation doesn't change the fundamental structure of the theory.  It's true that it creates more room for superficial disagreement and fallibility (of similar status to disagreements and fallibility regarding the effective means to some shared terminal values), but I see this as an improvement in degree and not in kind.  It still doesn't allow for *fundamental* disagreement and fallibility, e.g. amongst logically omniscient agents.

(I take it to be a metaethical datum that even people with different terminal values, or different Eliezerian "computations", can share the concept of a normative reason, and sincerely disagree about which (if either) of their values/computations is correctly tracking the normative reasons.  Similarly, we can coherently doubt whether even our coherently-extrapolated volitions would be on the right track or not.)
