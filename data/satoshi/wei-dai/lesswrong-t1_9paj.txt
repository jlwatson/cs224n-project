&gt;My impression is Jonah may have gotten wrong impressions of Wiener's views.

I responded [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i5w/norbert_wiener_on_automation_and_unemployment/9pag). 

&gt;I also didn't see where Jonah talked about Wiener not having updated much in response to incoming evidence. (What evidence?) Did you see that in his post, or did he write about it elsewhere?

I wrote this in our [full email exchange](http://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Can-we-know-what-to-do-about-AI.docx) and didn't provide justification. I no longer remember what I had in mind, and I may not have had good reasons for saying that. 

My best guess is that I was thinking something along the lines of "he didn't investigate sufficiently thoroughly to solicit and understand other people's opinions on the subject," but this is coming primarily from a general strong prior that people don't solicit other perspectives and try to understand them, rather than anything specific to Wiener, and I recognize that there's room for disagreement as to what prior is appropriate.
