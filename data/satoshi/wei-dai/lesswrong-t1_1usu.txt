I've written a reply to [Bayesian Flame](http://lesswrong.com/lw/147/bayesian_flame/), one of cousin_it's posts from last year. It's titled [Frequentist Magic vs. Bayesian Magic](http://blog.weidai.com/2010/04/this-is-belated-reply-to-cousinits-2009.html). I'd appreciate some review and comments before I post it here. Mainly I'm concerned about whether I've correctly captured the spirit of frequentism, and whether I've treated it fairly.

BTW, I wish there is a "public drafts" feature on LessWrong, where I can make a draft accessible to others by URL, but not show up in recent posts, so I don't have to post a draft elsewhere to get feedback before I officially publish it.
