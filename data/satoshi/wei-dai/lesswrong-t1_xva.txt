Suppose I put in a nerve block to artificially paralyze my left arm, and I notice that my left arm is indeed paralyzed. I then remove the nerve block and notice that my left arm is no longer paralyzed. Would that be sufficient to prove (to myself) that I don't have left-arm paralysis with anosognosia?

BTW, I'm not sure I understand the current fascination on this blog about anosognosia. Where is this train of thought going?
