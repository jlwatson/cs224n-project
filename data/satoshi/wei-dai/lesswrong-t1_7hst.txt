&gt; There are lots of words that I don't know how to taboo, because I only have a partial and largely intuitive understanding of the concepts I'm referring to by them, and can't fully explain those concepts. Examples: "exist", "truth", "correct"

Well, apparently TheOtherDave is bold enough to give a [meaningful definition](http://lesswrong.com/lw/e95/the_worst_argument_in_the_world/7fsp) of "exist". Would you agree with it? If not, what would be a counterexample?
