These are really interesting points. Just in case you haven't seen the developments on the thread, check out the whole thing [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2ft/open_thread_july_2010_part_2/2o1v?c=1).

I'm not sure that blackmail is a good name to use when thinking about my commitment, as it has negative connotations and usually implies a non-public, selfish nature.

I'm also pretty sure it's irrational to ignore such things when making decisions. Perhaps not in a game theory sense, but absolutely in the practical life-theory sense.

As an example, *our entire legal system is based on these sorts of credible threats*.

If EY feels differently I'm not sure what to say except that I think he's being foolish. I see the game theory he's pretending exempts him from considering others reactions to his actions, I just don't think it's rational to completely ignore new causal information.

But like I said earlier, I'm not saying he has to do anything, I'm just making sure we all know that an existential risk reduction of 0.0001% via LW censorship won't actually be a reduction of 0.0001%.

(and though you deleted the relevant part, I'd also be down to discuss what a sane moderation system should be like.)
