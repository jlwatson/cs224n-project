&gt; I think I do realize that this is a general argument that can be applied to all of our values. It doesn't seem to affect all of them equally though. Some values, such as wanting to be immortal, and wanting to understand the nature of reality, consciousness, etc., seem to survive the argument much better than others. :)

Honestly, I don't see what you're basing that conclusion on. What, according to you, determines which human values survive that argument and which not?
