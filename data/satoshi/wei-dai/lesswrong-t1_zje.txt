"In a way, the difficulty of group rationality makes sense. After all, rationality (or the potential for it) is almost a defining characteristic of individuality. If individuals from a certain group always acted for the good of the group, then what makes them individuals, rather than interchangeable parts of a single entity? For example, in Star Trek, don't we see a Borg cube as one individual precisely because it is too rational as a group? Since achieving perfect Borg-like group rationality presumably isn't what we want anyway, maybe settling for second best isn't so bad."

An intriguing statement.  However, you can extend it in the other direction, inside a person.  A group has different people with different values, which therefore fail to achieve optimal satisfaction of everyone's values.  An "individual" is composed of different subsystems trying to optimize different things, and the individual can't optimize them all.  This is an intrinsic property of life / optimizers / intelligence.  I don't think you can use it to define the level at which individuality exists.  (In fact, I think trying to define a single such level is hopelessly wrongheaded.)  If you did, I would not be an individual.
