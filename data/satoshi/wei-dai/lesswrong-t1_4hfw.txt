This may be stating the obvious, but the context often IS the informational content. Small talk especially has no surface level informational content so the goal of small talk isn't, obviously, to exchange surface level information.

This is another one of those situations where it's tempting (but wrong) to reason "Regular people like small talk. Small talk doesn't convey any information. Therefore small talk is pointless. Conclusion: regular people are insane and like to waste their time with pointless stuff". Funnily enough, when we try to figure out the behavior of other mammals we would never be so quick jump to the conclusion that they are idiots.
