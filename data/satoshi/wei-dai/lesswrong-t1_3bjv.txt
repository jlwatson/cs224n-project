&gt; The above seems fairly obvious, but the details of some of these heuristics are still puzzling. For example, why does payment or other form of obligation reduce motivation?

Supply and demand.  If you have a skill that's has worth a lot in trade, evolution doesn't want you lowering the price by doing it for free.  Conversely, if something isn't worth a lot in trade, but gets you friends/allies (i.e. you get smiles and small praise), then you're motivated to do it more.

It's only paradoxical until you imagine what would happen in a small community if the motivation scale was reversed.
