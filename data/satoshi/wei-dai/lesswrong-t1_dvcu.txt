I found a user named [chron](http://lesswrong.com/user/chron/overview/) whose posts are all banned for no apparently reason. (If you use this link you can see their comments, but while looking at a post or comment they replied to, chron's comment will show as "deleted".) This user also shows up in the list of [banned users](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/about/banned). But there seems to be nothing wrong with this user's posts/comments that I can see. I tried searching for a comment explaining why this user was banned but couldn't find one. Is there a place that records the reason why each banned user was banned? If so, could someone please link it to the [wiki page about moderation](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Moderation_tools_and_policies)?
