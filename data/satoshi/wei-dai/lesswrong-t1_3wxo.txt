The fear of public embarrassment can be a strong motivation to think more carefully about one's ideas. Without it, I think I will more often be tempted to make a comment or post without thinking through possible ways that I could be wrong. I'd like to preserve that motivation for myself as well as others, so let's not make the cost of publicly making a mistake *too* low.
