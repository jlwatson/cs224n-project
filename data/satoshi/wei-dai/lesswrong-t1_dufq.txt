&gt;I would describe this more generally as real-world achievement, which is a lot clearer than a label like "physical cognition"

There you go [again](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ol4/are_we_running_out_of_new_musicmoviesart_from_a/dn6p), compulsively trying to round concepts off to something else!

"Real-world achievement" is considerably *less* clear as a way of pointing to what I am trying to point to than "physical cognition". It evokes all kinds of distracting side-issues about what constitutes the "real world". (Is pure mathematics "real-world achievement"? *et cetera*, *et* ***cetera***). 

I can't tell what the point of your second paragraph is. Is it just an attempt to provide reassurance (to whom?) about the value of humanities academia, in the face of what you took to be a "boo humanities academia!" from me (in my comment on *Otium*)? Or are you seeking to dispute my contention that physical cognition is underpracticed and undervalued there (in which case it would tend to look like your proposal to substitute "real-world achievement" for "physical cognition" was an attempt to muddy the waters in preparation for an equivocation)?

All this notwithstanding, I'm grateful for the pointer to the Eric Raymond essay, as it is relevant to what I was talking about with respect to Maslow and so forth. (In particular, it serves as anecdotal information about, and confirmation of, the distinction between Levels 4 and 5.)
