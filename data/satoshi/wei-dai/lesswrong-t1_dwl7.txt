It doesn't look like a subset of fields to me. More like a subset of steps in each field that need to be done by outsiders, while both preceding and following steps can be done by academia. That's what I'm seeing with decision theory: academia worked out many prerequisites but got stuck, then LW got the chance to make a key step, but it didn't feed back into academia so we've stagnated since then.
