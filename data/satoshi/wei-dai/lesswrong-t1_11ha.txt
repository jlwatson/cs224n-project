Being in a transitionary period from [sputtering nonsense](http://causalityrelay.wordpress.com/2009/08/10/leveling-up/) to thinking in math, I don't feel right to write anything up (publicly) until I understand it well enough. But I can't help making occasional comments. Well, maybe that's a wrong mode as well.
