Nothing particularly riveting... Submitted it to a large numbers of philosophy journals in sequence, got either rejections or please modify and resubmit, did re-writings, and these were all eventually rejected. A few times it looked like it might get accepted, but then it was borderline rejected. Basically, they felt it was either not important enough, or they were committed to a probability view of anthropics, and didn't like the decision based approach.

Or that I was explaining it badly, but the reviewers were not consistent as to what was bad about the explanations.
