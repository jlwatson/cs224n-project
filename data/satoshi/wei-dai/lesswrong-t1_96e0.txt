(General reminder:  While it is possible that some hidden justification exists here, the default assumption is that "People are crazy, the world is mad" and the Gates Foundation has not happened to be an unusual exception.  Failure to optimize is a human default and it is not particularly probable that GiveWell is doing anything wrong.)
