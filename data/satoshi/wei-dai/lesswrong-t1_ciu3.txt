But then I'm allowed to ask "why?", and if the answer is "because I say so", then I feel pretty confident to dismiss the expert.

But that's not even the stage I'm at. A book is not an interactive medium, so the act has gone like this:

- book: Cross-validation!
- me: "Gaaaak! That sounds like totally wrong! Is there anyone that can explain me either why this is right or, if it's actually wrong, what is the correct approach?"

I'm still searching for an answer...
