Interesting. I think the [other](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2l2/what_a_reduction_of_could_could_look_like/) [approach](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9mq/rational_vs_real_utilities_in_the_cousin_itnesov/) that cousin\_it and Karl wrote about is more elegant (*) anyway, but cousin\_it was [dissatisfied](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9mq/rational_vs_real_utilities_in_the_cousin_itnesov/5sk7) with it because it involved an arbitrary time limit. Here's an idea for making it less arbitrary. Suppose instead of a halting oracle, we had an oracle for [General Turing Machines](http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/node6.html) that (in one cycle) outputs the final output of a given GTM if it converges. Then we can use it to look through all theorems of the form A()=a =&gt; U()&gt;=u, and return the action with the highest u, or an error ("break down and cry") if no such action exists.

(*) More elegant because 1) it doesn't require the "play chicken" step and 2) it doesn't require that the set of possible actions be finite.
