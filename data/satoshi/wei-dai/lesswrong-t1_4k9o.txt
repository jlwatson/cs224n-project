Eliezer's [justification](http://lesswrong.com/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/) for extending the "complexity of evolved motivation" to the "complexity of reflective equilibrium value", as far as I can tell, is that he knows or strongly suspects that the relevant reflective equilibrium involves people leading good lives, with the word "good" to be filled in by fun theory along the lines of what he's posted in the fun theory sequence, which in turn refers back to complex evolved motivation. That seems plausible enough to me, but I agree the aforementioned extension isn't an automatic step.
