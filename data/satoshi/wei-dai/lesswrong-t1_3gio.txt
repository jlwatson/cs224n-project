When we're trying to reduce intuitions, there's no helping starting from informal ideas. Another question is that it's not proper to stop there, but Richard doesn't exactly suggest that. 

A more salient to me question is, What are suggestions about redefining this "rational" intuitive idea good for, if it's supposed to be the source material? Such question even explains how the idea of considering, say, "consciousness", in a more precise sense is methodologically a step in the wrong direction: when words are the data you work with, you should be careful to assign new words to new ideas used for analyzing them.
