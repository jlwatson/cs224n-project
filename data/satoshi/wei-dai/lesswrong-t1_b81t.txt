From what I've seen in terms of word use, the "rationality" is mentioned when picking one of several explicitly listed choices. Whereas behaviours commonly described as "intelligent" usually involve actions from a very large number of potential choices. Hardly anyone says it is irrational to not invent something (but it certainly is unintelligent to be unable to invent something simple).
