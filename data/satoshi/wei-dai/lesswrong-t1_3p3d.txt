This is only tangentially related, but when I was in school I often wished that the curriculum included an outline of what is known and *not* known, instead of only teaching what is known with little sense of the big picture of human knowledge.

Actually, maybe it's not so tangential - teachers probably can do a lot to encourage admissions of ignorance if they had a habit of regularly admitting ignorance themselves.
