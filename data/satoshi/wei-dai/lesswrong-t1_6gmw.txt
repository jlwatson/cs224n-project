OK, I see what Paul probably meant. Let's say "utility value", not "utility function", since that's what we mean. I don't think we should be talking about "running utility value", because utility might be something given by an abstract definition, not state of execution of any program. As I discussed in the grandparent, the distinction I'm making is between the outer AGI controlling utility value (which it does) and outer AGI controlling the simulated researchers that prepare the definition of utility value (which it shouldn't be allowed to for AI safety reasons). There is a map/territory distinction between the *definition* of utility value prepared by the initial program and the utility value itself optimized by the outer AGI.
