&gt;It's less well appreciated, but I think true (though fuzzy), that many fields manage to circumvent the effects of diagonalization a bit further by considering objects that in some sense live on multiple levels of the hierarchy at the same time. I'd call that "the parametric polymorphism trick", perhaps.

Was the PA_K trick invented by you, and if not where can I learn more about it? Can you also give some references for other instances of this "parametric polymorphism trick"?
