Vladimir, I really do appreciate corrections. As you've seen, I update posts in response to them.

It's just that if you say 100 negative things to me in a row without saying a single positive thing, I start to get the impression that you think everything I write is bad, and I should stop writing. (If you doubt my impression, scroll through your last 100 comments that were replies to me.)

That's why I hope to gain an *accurate* impression of people's reaction to my work - so I can decide whether to keep writing.

If I get nothing but negative feedback from people or from a particular person, then I have to take guesses as to whether this is because (1) the vocalized feedback presents an accurate picture of their assessment of my work, or whether it's because (2) their vocalized feedback does *not* present an accurate impression of their assessment of my work (that is, they generally *appreciate* my writing), but they decide to only vocalize negative comments and never (or rarely) vocalize positive comments.

Does that make sense?
