What's ambiguous with the definition? For example, unsatisfiable statements will get about as big plausibility as the valid ones, and for theories that are not finitely axiomatizable, plausibility is not defined (so you can't ask about plausibility of some models, unless there is a categorical finite theory defining them). How to use this in decision-making is a special case of a more general open problem in ambient control.
