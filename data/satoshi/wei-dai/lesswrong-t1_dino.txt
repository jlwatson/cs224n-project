&gt;I also expect Facebook and similar products to move gradually in this direction over the coming decade. If they don’t, I think that’s probably a bad sign.

How do you expect this to happen? Facebook actually wanting to be a better global citizen instead of maximizing profits? Government regulation? Some sort of market-based solution (Facebook offering a user-aligned paid option that most people will then opt for, or competition from other social networks)? I'd be quite surprised if any of these happened. Am I missing something?

And why isn't it a bad sign that Facebook hasn't already done what you suggested in your post?
