The most stupid/incompetent part of LW AI belief cluster is it not understanding that 'the number of paperclips in the territory as far as you know' will require some sort of mathematical definition of paperclip in the territory, along with a lot of other stuff so far only defined in words (map territory distinction, and I don't mean the distinction between number of paperclips in the world model and number of paperclips in the real world, I mean the fuzzy idiocy that arises from the people whom are babbling about map and territory themselves not actually implementing the map territory distinction and not understanding that real world 'paperclips' can only be in some sort of map of the real world because the real world haven't got any high level object called 'paperclip' ). [Or not understanding how involved such a definition would be]

And then again, the AI is trying to maximize number of this mathematical definition of paperclip in the mathematical definition of territory, which, the way applied math is, would have other solutions than those matching English technobabble.

I don't see how UDT gets you anywhere closer (and if I seen that it would, I would be even more against SI because this is precisely the research for creating the dangerous AI, set up by a philosopher who has been given access to funds to hire qualified people to do something that's entirely pointless and only creates risk where there was none)

edit: to clarify on the map territory distinction. Understanding the distinction does not change the fact that multiple world states *are* mapped to one goal state, in the goal-definition itself, and are not distinguished by the goal-definition.

From what I can see, there's thorough confusion between 'understanding map-territory distinction' in the sense of understanding the logic of map and territory being distinct and the mapping being lossy, and the 'understanding map-territory distinction' in the loose sense like 'understanding how to drive a car', i.e. in the sense of somehow distinguishing the real world states that are mapped to same map state, and preferring across them.
