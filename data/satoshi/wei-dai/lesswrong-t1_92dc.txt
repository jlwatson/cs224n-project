There's an overview of the "quantum mind" debate among academics (whether quantum effects play an important role in the function of the brain) in FHI's [Whole Brain Emulation Roadmap](http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/3853/brain-emulation-roadmap-report.pdf) (page 37). This isn't quite the same question you're asking (since even if the brain uses quantum computing, an AI may be able to avoid it through some kind of algorithmic workaround), but I'd guess that most supporters of the "quantum mind" hypotheses would also answer "yes" to your question.
