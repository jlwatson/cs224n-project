[This](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/staff/richard_joyce/acrobat/joyce_accidental.error.theorist.pdf) article by Joyce doesn't cite Finlay, but its central topic is 'concessive strategies' for responding to Mackie, and Finlay is a leading figure in concessive strategies for responding to Mackie. Joyce also doesn't cite Finlay [here](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/staff/richard_joyce/acrobat/joyce_metaethical.pluralism.pdf), but it discusses how two people who accept that Mackie's suspect properties fail to refer might nevertheless speak two different languages about whether moral properties exist (as Joyce and Finlay do).

One way of expressing the central debate between them is to say that they are arguing over whether certain features (like moral 'absolutism' or 'objectivity') are 'essential' to moral concepts. (Without the assumption of absolutism, is X a 'moral' concept?) Another way to say that is to say that they are arguing over the boundaries of moral concepts; whether people can be said to share the 'same' concept of morality but disagree on some of its features, or whether this disagreement means they have 'different' concepts of morality.

But really, I'm just trying to get clear on what you might mean by saying that people have the 'same' concept of morality while disagreeing on fundamental features, and what you think the implications are. I'm sorry my pointers to the literature weren't too helpful.
