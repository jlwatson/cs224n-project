&gt; I disagree. I think you probably have a bias in how you interpret voting patterns, and the situation is not as politicized as you think.

I gave a specific example near the context of this quote and that comment is actually representative of the *specific subset* of rhetorical questioning that I hold in contempt. If you are right and I am incorrect about the merits of such comments then I would consider myself so fundamentally confused when reasoning about the quality of comments like those that anything I have to say about that topic really is almost worthless. There is a corollary there as well.

&gt; It seems to me that rhetorical questions are more of a dark arts technique when you're making a speech and can use them to lead your audience to a desired conclusion. In a debate 

Debates are roughly equivalent to (or a subset of) speeches when it comes to rhetoric use. Discussions are different. Note that if rhetorical questions of the [kind david describes](http://lesswrong.com/lw/9c/mandatory_secret_identities/7jfu) (where the speaker believes the recipient almost certainly disagrees with the implied answer but the speaker wants to persuaded the audience) and this is done in the context of "discussion" then the speaker is being disingenuous and *it is really a debate or speech to the audience*. 

&gt; which seems like a pretty reasonable use.

Yes. You should note that most of the grandparent consisted of saying that rhetorical questions *per se* aren't something I oppose.

(Note that I do believe it is unwise for me to continue this conversation. While I succumbed to the temptation to respond to textual stimulus with this comment you may consider me weakly-to-moderately precommitted to not responding further.)
