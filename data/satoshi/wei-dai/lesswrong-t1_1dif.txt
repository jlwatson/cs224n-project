I have difficulty treating this metaphor as a metaphor.  As a thought experiment in which I run into these definitely non-human aliens, and I happen to have a positional advantage with respect to them, and I want to "help" them and must now decide what "help" means... then it feels to me like I want more detail.

Is it literally true that the slave is conscious and the master unconscious?

What happens when I tell the slave about the master and ask it what should be done?

Is it the case that the slave might want to help me if it had a positional advantage over me, while the master would simply use me or disassemble me?
