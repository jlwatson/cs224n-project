My understanding is that Bitcoin involves one major innovation (approximate solution to the Byzantine Generals problem) and the rest is existing tech.  Granted, one probably should consider the precise balancing of incentives in the more arbitrary characteristics of BTC to be an innovation, but I'm not sure to what degree that required active management and changes (I have not examined the first version of the source code).

Presumably FAI still has many innovations to go, and as they are publicly solved the chances of a basement project solving the remainder increases.

On an unrelated note: Do you have an opinion on the fact that BTC does not include a proof of stake system in figuring out who to trust WRT to forks in the blockchain?  It seems like the only major flaw in the protocol.  The lead dev Andresen has discussed potentially instituting a proof of stake system for weighting votes in case of another emergency like the fork caused by the client update recently.  I was surprised such things were not included in the original protocol given how well thought out the rest was.  If someone is smart enough to think about proof-of-work systems it seems unlikely they wouldn't have been aware of proof-of-stake as a means of establishing trust.
