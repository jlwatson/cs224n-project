I don't understand the objection to the universal prior.  Definition and computation are not the same thing.  Yes, definition is subject to Berry's Paradox if you don't differentiate between definition, meta-definition, etc; but computation is not.  In particular, what you list as "a short description" is only computable if P is, which a univeral prior won't be.  (I would think the non-computability in itself would be more of a problem!)
