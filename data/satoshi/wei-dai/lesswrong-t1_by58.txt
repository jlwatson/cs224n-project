This seems similar to an idea that I described (informally) in a [previous comment](http://lesswrong.com/lw/nc/newcombs_problem_and_regret_of_rationality/1265). There are some comments about it from Eliezer in that thread, which (if my understanding is correct) apply here as well. 

I'm not sure that using Solomonoff measure is good enough for our purpose here. It seems to me that you at least need something that assigns positive measure to uncomputable universes/histories. For example if you replace the universal Turing machine in the Solomonoff measure with oracle machines, then you could get the agent to care about some of the mathematical structures that exist higher on the arithmetical hierarchy. But I don't know how to get a UDT agent to care about all possible mathematical structures.
