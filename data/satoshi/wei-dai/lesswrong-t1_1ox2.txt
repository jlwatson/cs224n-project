&gt;One handy debiasing technique: http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/write-your-hypothetical-apostasy.html

&gt;You are suggesting I do this? Have you done it yourself, did it work?

Yes, I've used it with respect to several scientific and ideological issues where I had significant incentives or potential biases favoring one view or another. It helps to bring issues into sharp focus that were previously not salient. In psych experiments it's one of the only immediately effective debiasing techniques.
