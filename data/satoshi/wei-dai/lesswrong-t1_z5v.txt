* After the truth destroyed everything it could, the only thing left was Eliezer Yudkowsky.
* In his free time, Eliezer Yudkowsky likes to help the Halting Oracle answer especially difficult queries.
* Eliezer Yudkowsky actually happens to be the pinnacle of Intelligent Design. He only claims to be the product of evolution to remain approachable to the rest of us.
* Omega did its Ph.D. thesis on Eliezer Yudkowsky. Needless to say, it's too long to be published in this world. Omega is now doing post-doctoral research, tentatively titled "Causality vs. Eliezer Yudkowsky - An Indistinguishability Argument".
