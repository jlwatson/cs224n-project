This seems to be a variation on my pet peeve of people simply [ignoring](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1gg/agree_retort_or_ignore_a_post_from_the_future/) their opponents' arguments and walking away (virtually) from a debate. I guess you're seeing this version more often because of your higher status, and/or because you debate people more in real life, so your opponents can't afford to just act as if they didn't hear what you said, or as if your arguments aren't worth responding to.
