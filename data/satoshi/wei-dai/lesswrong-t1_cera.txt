I'm going on the [one learning algorithm hypothesis](http://www.wired.com/2013/05/neuro-artificial-intelligence/) that's become popular in parts of the neuroscience community, together with my subjective impressions. Intuitively, it seems parsimonious to suppose that evolution hijacked the algorithms used for sensory processing for general intelligence. I don't think that the algorithms are *the same*, but I would guess that they're relatives.
