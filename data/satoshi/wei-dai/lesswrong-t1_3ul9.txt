&gt;"Hey, we have cryptanalytic methods that can infer any cipher, key, or plaintext unless you intelligently destroy as many patterns in the ciphertext as you can."

Where did you get this? In modern cryptanalysis, it's counted as a win for the cryptanalyst if he or she can find *any* pattern in the ciphertext (i.e., give an algorithm that can distinguish a ciphertext from a random string with probability &gt; .5). But even when this is true, it's usually not the case that one can then go on to infer the full key or plaintext.
