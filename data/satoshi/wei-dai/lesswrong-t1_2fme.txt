As someone who thought the OP was of poor quality, and who has had a very high opinion of SIAI and EY for a long time (and still has), I'll say that that "Eliezer Yudkowsky facts" was indeed a lot worse. It was the most embarrassing thing I've ever read on this site. Most of those jokes aren't even good.
