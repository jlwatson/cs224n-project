So far as I can see, your mistake was assuming "symmetry", and dropping probabilities. There is no symmetry, only one of the possibilities is what will actually happen, and the other (which I'm back to believing since the last post on DT list) is inconsistent, though you are unlikely to be able to actually prove any such inconsistency. You can't say that since (S(1)=A =&gt; S(2)=B) therefore (S(1)=B =&gt; S(2)=A). One of the counterfactuals is inconsistent, so if S(1) is in fact A, then S(1)=B implies anything. But what you are dealing with are probabilities of these statements (which possibly means proof search schemes trying to prove these statements and making a certain number of elementary assumptions, the number that works as the length of programs in universal probability distribution). These probabilities will paint a picture of what you expect the other copy to do, depending on what you do, and this doesn't at all have to be symmetric.
