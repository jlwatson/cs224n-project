The last step doesn't look valid to me. After updating on the evidence, you have a human who thinks they've seen a halting oracle, and a Solomonoff agent who thinks he's seen a highly improbable event that doesn't involve a halting oracle. The fact that the human assigns a higher probability to the observations is unconvincing, because he could've just been extraordinarily lucky.

Also, there are entities that are impossible to distinguish from halting oracles using all the computational resources in the universe, which are not actually halting oracles. For example, a "can be proven to halt using a proof shorter than 3^^^3 bits" oracle has nonzero probability under the Solomonoff prior.
