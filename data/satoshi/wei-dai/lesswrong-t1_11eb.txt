Oh, 'ello. Glad to see somebody still remembers the proximity argument. But it's adapted to our world where you generally cannot kill a million distant people to make one close relative happy. If we move to a world where Omegas regularly ask people difficult questions, a lot of people adopting proximity reasoning will cause a huge tragedy of the commons.

About Eliezer's question, I'd exchange my life for a reliable 0.001 chance of healing reality, because I can't imagine living meaningfully after being offered such a wager and refusing it. Can't imagine how I'd look other LW users in the eye, that's for sure.
