&gt; I don't see how life can be exterminated once it has spread that far.

You may be right.  It takes a long time to become a multi-galaxy super-civilization.  IIRC our galaxy is 100,000 light-years across, and the nearest galaxy is about 2 million light-years away.  We might make it in time.  It depends a lot on how far time-compression goes, and on how correlated apocalypses are.

 &gt; "liberate much of the energy in the black hole at the center of our galaxy in a giant explosion" does not make sense, since a black hole is not considered a store of energy that can be liberated.

Wrong.  Google 'black hole explosions'.

&gt; I argue that the amount of physics left to be discovered is finite, and therefore the likelihood that a galaxy/universe killer can be built in the future does not approach arbitrarily close to 1 as time goes to infinity.

That's my hope as well.
