Intuition seems to be one of the least studied areas of cognitive science, at least until very recently. The Wikipedia entry on cognitive sciences that the post links to has no mention of "intuition", and one paper I found said that the 1999 MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Sciences doesn't even have a single index entry for it (while "logic" has almost 100 references).

After a bit more searching, I found a 2007 book titled [Intuition in Judgment and Decision Making](http://www.amazon.com/Intuition-Judgment-Decision-Henning-Plessner/dp/0805857419), which apparently represents the current state of the art in understanding the nature of intuition.
