&gt;For example, when discussing gender-related problems, it seems inevitable that some proposed solutions will generally be better for men, and other solutions will generally be better for women.

Even this is too simplistic. Polygyny is better for high status men and most women, and bad for low status men and high status women. (And this is before you get to the evolutionary effects, which are both positive and negative and thus hard to judge!)
