&gt; To those who say they don't want to be wireheaded, how do you really know that, when you haven't tried wireheading? 

But it's not because I think there's some downside to the experience that I don't want it.  The experience is as good as can possibly be.  I want to continue to be someone who thinks things and does stuff, even at a cost in happiness.
