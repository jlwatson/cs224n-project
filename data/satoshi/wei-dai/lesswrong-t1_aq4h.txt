Thanks. I have some followup questions :)

1. What projects are you currently working on?/What confusing questions are you attempting to answer?
2. Do you think that most people should be very uncertain about their values, e.g. altruism?
3. Do you think that your views about the path to FAI are contrarian (amongst people working on FAI/AGI, e.g. you believing most of the problems are philosophical in nature)? If so, why?
4. Where do you hang out online these days? Anywhere other than LW?

Please correct me if I've misrepresented your views.
