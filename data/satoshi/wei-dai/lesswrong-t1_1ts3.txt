&gt; After step one, you have a 50% chance of finding yourself the original; there is nothing controversial about this much. 

That's not the way my subjective anticipation works, so the assertion of uncontroversialness is premature. I anticipate that after step one I have a 100% chance of being the copy, and a 100% chance of being the original. (Which is to say, both of those individuals will remember my anticipation.)
