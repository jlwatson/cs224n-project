I see, maybe I should have been more clear. The point of my post is that SIAI members should not express controversial views *without substantiating them with abundant evidence*. If SIAI provided compelling evidence that Eliezer's work has higher expected value to humanity than what virtually everybody else is doing, then I would think Eliezer's comment appropriate. 

As things stand SIAI has not provided such evidence. Eliezer himself may have such evidence, but if so he's either unwilling or unable to share it.
