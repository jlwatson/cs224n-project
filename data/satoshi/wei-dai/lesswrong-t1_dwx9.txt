Some ideas:

* Open up MIRI's internal discussions about strategy as they happen.
* Open up MIRI's workshops as they happen, let people participate remotely.
* Prizes, like Quantified Health or Paul's recent offer of funding for AI alignment research.
* Post drafts of papers before publishing them.
* Summarize and discuss ideas from Arbital.
* Summarize and discuss Paul's work.
* Guest posts / debates / AMAs with high profile non-LW people. Think someone like Nick Bostrom ideally.
* Merge IAFF and the MIRI news blog into LW 2.0.
