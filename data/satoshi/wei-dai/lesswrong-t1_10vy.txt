Omega offers you the healing of all the rest of Reality; every other sentient being will be preserved at what would otherwise be death and allowed to live and grow forever, and all unbearable suffering not already in your causal past will be prevented.  You alone will die.

You wouldn't take a trustworthy 0.001 probability of that reward and a 0.999 probability of death, over the status quo?  I would go for it so fast that there'd be speed lines on my quarks.

Really, this whole debate is just about people being told "X utilons" and interpreting utility as having diminishing marginal utility - I don't see any reason to suppose there's more to it than that.
