For what it's worth, I have a strong injunction *against* taking ideas seriously. I always seem to want better proofs than are available. This doesn't look like a double standard from inside: I disbelieve in the Singularity only slightly more than I disbelieve in space elevators and fusion power in the near future.

I wonder why you take Tegmark's multiverse seriously. It seems to be the odd one out on your list, an obviously wrong idea. Have they found a workaround for the problem of teacups turning into pheasants?
