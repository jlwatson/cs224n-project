Yeah, I hear that claim a lot.  It seems to apply to some other world than this one.  At some point one must notice when an idealistic belief is failing to accumulate evidence in favor of itself.

We'll see whether publishing this outline yields any criticisms or suggestions over and above what Nesov and Dai already managed to say based on merely "I have a timeless decision theory".  I'm not holding my breath.  This outline actually is enough that someone versed in Newcomblike problems *and* causality ought to be able to make out what I'm talking about, and with a bit of intelligence work out on their own just how many classical dilemmas it solves.  Nonetheless I fully expect this post to drop into the void and never be heard from again.

That's not because of an evil conspiracy, of course.  It's just the default course of events in academia.
