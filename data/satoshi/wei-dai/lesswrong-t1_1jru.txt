&gt;Morality is about how to save babies, not eat them, everyone knows that and they happen to be right. If we could get past difficulties of the translation, the babyeaters would agree with us about what is moral, we would agree with them about what is babyeating, and we would agree about the physical fact that we find different sorts of logical facts to be compelling.

This simply pushes the problem back one level, by making the word "morality" descriptive instead of normative.  Morality is X and babyeating is Y.  But how should one choose between morality and babyeating?  Now, instead of a moral anti-realist, I'm a moral realist, a babyeating realist, and normative judgement anti-realist.
