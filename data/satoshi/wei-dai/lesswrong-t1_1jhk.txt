These all sound to me like logical questions where you don't have conscious access to the premises you're using, and can only try to figure out the premises by looking at what seem like good or bad conclusions.  But with respect to the general question of whether we are talking about (a) the way events are or (b) which conclusions follow from which premises, it sounds like we're doing the latter.  Other "philosophical" questions (like 'What's up with the Born probabilities?' or 'How should I compute anthropic probabilities?') may actually be about (a).
