I agree this is one of the really central problems in rationality. There was some previous discussion on this topic at http://lesswrong.com/lw/f9/a_request_for_open_problems/bun including links to some books/articles on the topic, but unfortunately none of it goes very far towards solving the problem. I think the lack of further discussion on logical/mathematical uncertainty isn't due to lack of interest, but instead due to lack of new ideas.
