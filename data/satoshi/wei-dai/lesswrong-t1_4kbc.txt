There are many, but unfortunately I only have enough motivation to list a few:

- If talking to someone with strange beliefs in person, legitimately trying to engage with their ideas is an easy way to signal all kinds of positive things. (Maturity, charity, epistemic seriousness, openness to new experiences or ideas, and things like that, as opposed to common alternatives like abrasiveness, superficiality, pedantry, and the like.)
- Reading things by smart folk who believe things that at least initially appear to be obviously false is a way to understand how exactly humans tend to fail at epistemic reasoning. For example, when I read *Surprised by Joy* by C. S. Lewis---not to learn about his religion, but to read about *sehnsucht*, something I often experience---it was very revealing how he described his conversion from unreflective atheism to idealist monadology-esque-ness/deism-ness to theism to Christianity. Basically, he did some basically sound metaphysical reasoning---though of course not the kind that constrains anticipations---which led him all the way nigh-deism. 'We are all part of a unified universe, our responsibility is to experience as much of the universe as possible so it can understand itself' or something like that. All of a sudden he's thinking 'Well I already believe in this vague abstract force thingy, and the philosophers who talk about that are obviously getting their memes from earlier philosophers who said the same thing about God, and this force thingy is kinda like God in some ways, so I might as well consider myself a theist.' Then he learns that Jesus Christ probably actually existed in an off-the-cuff conversation with an atheist friend and scholar, and then he gets very vague and talks about how he suddenly doesn't remember much and oh yeah all of a sudden he's on his way to the zoo and realizes he's a Christian. It's not really clear what this entails in terms of anticipations, though he might've talked about his argument from *sehnsucht* for the existence of heaven. Anyway, it's clear from what he wrote that he just felt uncomfortable and somewhere along the line stopped caring as much about *reasons*, and started just, ya know, going with what seemed to be the trend of his philosophical speculations, which might I remind you never paid rent in anticipated experience up until that very last, very vague step. I found it to be a memorable cautionary tale, reading the guy's own words about his fall into the entropy of insanity. Whether or not Christianity is correct, whatever that means, it is clear that he had stopped caring about reasons, and it is clear that this was natural and easy and non-extraordinary. As someone who does a fair bit of metaphysical reasoning that doesn't *quite* pay rent in anticipated experience, or doesn't pay very much rent anyway, I think it is good to have Lewis's example in mind.
- Building the skill of *actually paying attention to what people actually say*. This is perhaps the most important benefit. Less Wrong folk are *much* better at this than most persons, and this skill itself goes a long, long way. The default for humans is of course to figure out which side the other person is arguing for and then either spout a plausibly-related counterargument for your chosen side if it is the opposite, or nod in agreement or the like if they're on your team. Despite doing it much less than most humans, it still appears to be par for the course for aspiring rationalists. (But there may be some personal selection bias 'cuz people pattern match what I (Will_Newsome) say to some other stupid thing and address the stupid generator of that stupid thing while bypassing whatever I actually said, either because I am bad at communication or because I've been justifiably classified as a person who is a priori likely to be stupid.) It is worth noting that sometimes this is a well-intentioned strategy to help resolve others' confusions by jumping immediately to suggesting fixes for the confusion-generator, but most often it's the result of sloppy reading. Anyway, by looking carefully at what smart people say that disagrees with what you believe or value, you train yourself to generally not throw away possibly countervailing evidence. It may be that what was written was complete tosh, but you won't know unless you actually check from time to time, and even if it's all tosh it's still excellent training material.
- Practice learning new concepts and languages. This is a minor benefit as generally it would be best to learn a directly useful new conceptual language, e.g. category theory.
- Cultural sophistication, being able to signal cultural sophistication. Though this can easily implicitly endorse negative sum signalling games and I personally don't see it as a good reason if done for signalling. That said, human culture is rich and complex, and I personally am afraid of being held in contempt as unsophisticated by someone like Douglas Hofstadter for not having read enough Dostoyevsky or listened to enough Chopin, so I read Dostoyevsky and listen to Chopin (and generally try to be perfect, whatever that means). Truly understanding *spirituality* and to a lesser extent religion is basically a large part of understanding humans and human culture. Though this is best done experientially, just like reading and listening to music, it really helps, especially for nerds, to have a decent theoretical understanding of what spiritualists and religionists might or might not be actually talking about.
- Related to the above, a whole bunch of people assert that various seemingly-absurd ideas are incredibly important for some reason. I find this an object of intrinsic curiosity and perhaps others would too. In order to learn more it is really quite important to figure out what those various seemingly-absurd ideas actually are.
- I could probably go on for a while. I would estimate that I missed one or two big reasons, five mildly persuasive reasons, and a whole bunch of 'considerations'. Opportunity costs are of course *not* taken into account in this analysis.
