&gt;Tulips objectively exist as a fuzzy cluster in configuration space, and if an AI were to list all facts about the world, this would be one of them. 

I was being a bit ambiguous: I mean to talk about concrete individual tulips, not the species. Even given the framework in 'The Cluster Structure...", each actual tulip is a point in thingspace, not a cluster.
