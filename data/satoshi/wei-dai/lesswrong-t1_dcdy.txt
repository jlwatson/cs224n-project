Yes. But I guess that there is a large class of interesting property protocols that can't be implemented with bitcoins. Like the variants of 'two-phase commit' that are part of many step by step property transactions ('concurrent' in financial jargon). I wonder whether there is a non-turing complete set of primitives that suffices for more current legal transactions. Probably a lot can be learned by asking a notary with programming experience...
