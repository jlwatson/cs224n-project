Please, please, please, I beg you:

**Learn to touch-type. Learn to type with ten fingers.**

Computer programs and websites to do this abound. If you find one that's horrible to use, find another. But *persist* until you do.

I am appalled at how many people I know who use computers typing for hours a day, and never learned *how to drive a keyboard*. They insist they're just as fast as they would be touch-typing (they're not), and *then* complain of sore fingers from doing weird stuff to adapt to their *inability to type properly*.

Anyone reading this site uses computers enough they should know how to type. I would estimate (based on my geeky friends I've seen at a keyboard) less than 20% of you can touch-type properly.

Set up your desk, chair etc per the handy how-to-avoid-RSI diagrams that one can hardly get away from in any setting. Then **LEARN HOW TO TYPE.** And don't make an excuse for why you're a special snowflake who doesn't need to.

By the way, when I discovered IRC big time (1996), it took my speed from 60wpm to 90wpm. Complete sentences, they're your friend.

My daughter is three and a half. She is already more skilled with the computers at nursery than the staff are. (Can get from the CBeebies games to watching Octonauts on the iPlayer in the blink of an eye!) I'm going to make sure she learns to type properly as soon as possible after she learns to read, dexterity allowing.
