Given that there is a nontrivial chance that the policy won't be implemented reliably, and partially because of that the other side will fail to fear it properly, the expected utility of trying to implement this policy seems hideously negative (that is, there is a good chance a city will be nuked as a result, after which the policy crumbles under the public pressure, and after that everyone develops the technology).
