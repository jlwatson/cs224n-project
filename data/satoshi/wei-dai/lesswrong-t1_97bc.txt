UDT doesn't handle non-base-level maximization vantage points (previously "epistemic vantage points") for blackmail - you can blackmail a UDT agent because it assumes your strategy is fixed, and doesn't realize you're only blackmailing it because you're simulating it being blackmailable.  As currently formulated UDT is also non-naturalistic and assumes the universe is divided into a not-you environment and a UDT algorithm in a Cartesian bubble, which is something TDT is supposed to be better at (though we don't actually have good fill-in for the general-logical-consequence algorithm TDT is supposed to call).

I expect the ultimate theory to look more like "TDT modded to handle UDT's class of problems and blackmail and anything else we end up throwing at it" than "UDT modded to be naturalistic and etc", but I could be wrong - others have different intuitions about this.
