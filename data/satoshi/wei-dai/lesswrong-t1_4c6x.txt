&gt; Belief that there's some Platonic ideal of "value" against which currencies should be measured 

I find it funny how fans of mainstream economics mock goldbugs about this, while at the same time basing a large part of their own theories on a far more extreme Platonic concept of "real" values calculated using price indexes.
