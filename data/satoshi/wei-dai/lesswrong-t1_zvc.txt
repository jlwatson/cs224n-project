&gt;Actually, why doesn't the Hero's world have a Counter-Force? Shouldn't every world have something like it? How many times have our world escaped from the brink of nuclear annihilation, for example?

It's not a question of how many times we've come dangerously close to annihilation, but of how obviously we've done so. 

In Aerhien's world, it's obvious because, yes, it's happened many times, but especially because it's happened in such a way that they've *noticed* it every time, thanks to the Dust's habit of gradual conquest and oppression.

In our world, however... well, you ask how many times we've "escaped from the brink of nuclear annihilation". We don't know, exactly, and we don't know how close we really got to annihilation. It's not obvious that we really got that lucky, so we had no reason to dream up a Counter-Force.
