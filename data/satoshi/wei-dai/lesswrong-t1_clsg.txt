As the efficiency of a logically irreversible computer approaches the Landauer limit, its speed must approach zero, for the same reason why as the efficiency of a heat engine approaches the Carnot limit its speed must approach zero.

I don't have an equation at hand, but I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out that biological neurons operate close to the physical limit for their speed.

EDIT:

I found [this](http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/59316/human-as-a-heat-engine/59367#59367) Physics Stack Exchange answer about the thermodynamic efficiency of human muscles.
