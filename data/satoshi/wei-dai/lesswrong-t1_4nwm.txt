As far as I can tell, in this comment you present an analogy between moral judgements and empirical judgements. You then provide arguments against a specific claim saying "these two situations don't share a [deep cause](http://lesswrong.com/lw/rj/surface_analogies_and_deep_causes/)". But you don't seem to have provided arguments *for* the judgements sharing a deep cause in the first place. It seems like a surface analogy to me.
