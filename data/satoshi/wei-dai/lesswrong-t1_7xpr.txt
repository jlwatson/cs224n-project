I was responding to the sentence:
"If you look at the most interesting recent advances in philosophy, it seems that most of them were made by non-philosophers."

..which does not mention "advances in philosophy useful to FAI".

&gt;Do you disagree, or have a alternative definition?

None of them have been much discussed by phils. (except possibly Bostrom, the Diane Hsieh of LessWrongism).
