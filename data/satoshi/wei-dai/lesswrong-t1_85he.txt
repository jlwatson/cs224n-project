The *practice* of moral philosophy doesn't much resemble the practice of mathematics. Mainly because in moral philosophy we don't know exactly what we're talking about when we talk about morality. In mathematics, particularly since the 20th century, we can eventually precisely specify what we mean by a mathematical object, in terms of sets.

"Morality is logic" means that when we talk about morality we are talking about a mathematical object. The fact that the only place in our mind the reference to this object is stored is our intuition is what makes moral philosophy so difficult and non-logicy. In practice you can't write down a complete syntactic description of morality, so in general¹ neither can you write syntactic proofs of theorems about morality. This is not to say that such descriptions or proofs do not exist!

In practice moral philosophy proceeds by a kind of probabilistic reasoning, which might be analogized to the thinking that leads one to conjecture that P≠NP, except with even less rigor. I'd expect that things like the order of moral arguments mattering come down to framing effects and other biases which are always involved regardless of the subject, but don't show up in mathematics so much because proofs leave little wiggle room.

¹ Of course, you may be able to write proofs that only use simple properties that you can be fairly sure hold of morality without knowing its full description, but such properties are usually either quite boring or not widely agreed upon or don't lead to interesting proofs due to being too specific. eg. "It's wrong to kill someone without their permission when there's nothing to be gained by it."
