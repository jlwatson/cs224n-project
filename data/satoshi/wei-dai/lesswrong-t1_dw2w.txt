If we want a measure of rationality that's orthogonal to intelligence, maybe we could try testing the ability to overcome motivated reasoning? Set up a conflict between emotion and reason, and see how the person reacts. The [marshmallow test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment) is an example of that. Are there other such tests, preferably ones that would work on adults? Which emotions would be easiest?
