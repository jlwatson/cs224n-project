In metaethics, there are typically very good arguments against all known views, and only relatively weak arguments for each of them. For anything in philosophy, a good first stop is the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/). Here are some articles on the topic at SEP:

- [Moral Anti-Realism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/)
- [Moral Realism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/)
- [Metaethics](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaethics/)
- [Moral Cognitivism vs Non-cognitivism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-cognitivism/)

I think the best book to read on metaethics is:

- [An Introduction to Contemporary Metaethics](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Contemporary-Metaethics-Alex-Miller/dp/074562345X)
