Even more than an explanation, I would appreciate an explanation on the [LessWrong Wiki](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Updateless_decision_theory) because there currently isn't one! I've just reread through the LW posts I could find about UDT and I guess I should let them stew for awhile. I might also ask people at the current MIRI workshop for their thoughts in person. 

&gt; Another thing to keep in mind is that UDT is currently formulated mainly for AI rather than human use (whereas you seem to be thinking mostly in human terms).

Only as an intuition pump; when it's time to get down to brass tacks I'm much happier to talk about a well-specified program than a poorly-specified human.
