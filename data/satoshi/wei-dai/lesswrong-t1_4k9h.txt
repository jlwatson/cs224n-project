In other words, it sounds like you're saying human values are complex because *all* values are complex. But that doesn't by itself prove that human values are much *more* complex than those of a pleasure maximizer, which is a claim that I take to be included in the "value is complex"/"thou art godshatter" idea.

ETA: Though your point may well be sufficient to support the particular implication that we're unlikely to get the values right by hard-coding them or having them randomly emerge.
