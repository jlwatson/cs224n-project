By "current morality" I mean that the current version of you may dislike some outcomes of your future moral deliberations if Omega shows them to you in advance. It's quite possible that you have a psychological disposition to eventually construct a moral system that the current version of you will find abhorrent. For an extreme test case, imagine that your long-term "psychological dispositions" are actually coming from a random number generator; that doesn't mean you cannot make any moral judgments today.
