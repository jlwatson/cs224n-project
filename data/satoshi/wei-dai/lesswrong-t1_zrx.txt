One obvious "upgrade" to any decision theory that has such problems is to discard all of your knowledge (data, observations) before making any decisions (save for some structural knowledge to leave the decision algorithm nontrivial). For each decision that you make (using given decision algorithm) while knowing X, you can make a conditional decision (using the same decision algorithm) that says "If X, then A else B", and then recall whether X is actually true. This, for example, mends the particular failure of not being able to precommit (you remember that you are on the losing branch only after you've made the decision to do a certain disadvantageous action if you are on the losing branch).
