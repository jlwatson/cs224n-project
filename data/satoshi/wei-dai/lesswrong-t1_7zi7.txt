As a synthetic biologist, I justify the lack of regulation of my work by saying "I don't do that kind of synthetic biology." Saying "synthetic biology" could lead to a super-plague is like saying "computer science" could lead to an uFAI. Sure, but the majority of the work is harmless. The VAST majority. The only real safety measures I can think of that would work at this point would be censorship of disease research.
