Do you have to the same meaning if you have the same referent?

For example "that beaker of water" to five year old means something wet, fluid and drinkable in a glass container whereas to a chemistry student it means a fluid made of hydrogen and oxygen, that can be used to dilute solutions. Yet they are both talking about the same thing.
