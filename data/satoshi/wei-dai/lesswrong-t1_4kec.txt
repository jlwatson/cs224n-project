This should've been obvious from the start, but your comment has forced me to realize it only now: if we understand reflective equilibrium as the end result of unrestricted iterated self-modification, then it's very sensitive to starting conditions. You and I could end up having very different value systems because I'd begin my self-modification by strengthening my safeguards against simplification of values, while you'd begin by weakening yours. And a stupid person doing unrestricted iterated self-modification will just end up someplace stupid. So this interpretation of "reflective equilibrium" is almost useless, right?
