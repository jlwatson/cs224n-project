You say you have stacked assumptions in favor of project B, but then you make two quite bizarre assumptions:

1. A singleton has a one in 5 billion chance of giving you control of the entire visible universe,

2. In the non-singleton scenario, there is zero probability that any of the universe outside the solar system will have any utility.

To make these assumptions is essentially to prejudge the matter in favor of project A, for obvious reasons; but that says nothing about what the outcome would be given more plausible assumptions.
