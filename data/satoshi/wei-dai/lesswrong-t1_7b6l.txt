Well, look at your own links.

1. In the first link, for *three* papers, there's exactly one substantive comment on a paper
2. The second link has roughly 3 or 4 comment threads which revolve around a specific point which seemed to cause changes in the paper, with the rest of the comments being relatively unrelated.
3. The third link contains some interesting comments *about* the paper on a meta level, but nothing that could be useful to the author, IMO.

As for my own feedback, I keep a public list in http://www.gwern.net/Links#fn2 Going backwards through the last 3:

1. the power post's few comments are dominated by citation format, matriarchy and why anyone cares. None of these were useful to me except maybe the format carping.
2. the Sobel post has maybe 2 or 3 comments of value
3. the intelligence failures link garnered 1 comment of value
