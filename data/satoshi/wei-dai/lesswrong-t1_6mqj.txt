This comment was written 3 days before the [post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/55r/meta_how_should_lw_account_deletion_work/) komponisto linked to, which discussed the issue of account deletion feature having been broken at that time (Apr 2011); the comment was probably the cause of that post. I don't see where it indicates the state of this feature around summer 2010. Since "nothing happens" behavior was indicated as an error (in Apr 2011), account deletion probably did something else before it stopped working.
