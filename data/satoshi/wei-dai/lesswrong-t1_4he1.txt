&gt; Have you tried having others who are metaethically confused play Taboo in real life, and if so, did it help?

Yes. The most common result is that people come to realize they don't know what they mean by 'morally good', unless they are theists.

&gt; People like Eliezer and Drescher, von Neumann and Savage, have been able to make clear progress in understanding the nature of rationality, and the methods they used did not involve much (if any) neuroscience. On "morality" we don't have such past successes to guide us, but your focus on neuroscience still seems misguided according to my intuitions.

If it looks like I'm focusing on neuroscience, I think that's an accident of looking at work I've produced in a 4-month period rather than over a longer period (that hasn't occurred yet). I don't think neuroscience is as central to metaethics or rationality as my recent output might suggest. Humans with meat-brains are strange agents who will make up a tiny minority of rational and moral agents in the history of intelligent agents in our light-cone (unless we bring an end to intelligent agents in our light-cone).
