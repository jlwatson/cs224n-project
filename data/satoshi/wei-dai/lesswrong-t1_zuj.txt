As a practical matter, this would not have been possible. At the end of World War II, the U.S. didn't have *enough* nuclear weapons to do much more than threaten to blow up a city or two. Furthermore, intercontinental ballistic missiles didn't exist yet; the only way to get a nuclear bomb to its target was to put it in an airplane and hope the airplane doesn't get shot down before it gets to its destination.
