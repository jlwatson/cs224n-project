No problem. QI still does confuse me somewhat. If my reading of the situation is correct, then properly implemented quantum suicide really would win you the lottery, without you especially losing anything. (yes, in the branches where you lose, you no longer exist, but since I am branching at a rate of 10^10^2 or so splits per second, who cares about a factor of 10^6 here or there? Survival for just one extra second would make up for it - the number of "me's" is increasing so quickly that losing 99.999999% of them is negated by waiting a fraction of a second)
