Is Bitcoin's monetary policy really expected to be a problem?  If it were to reach a steady state adoption and usage level, I imagine Bitcoin's price would stabilize around some constant fraction of (the present value of) the market's expectation of future world GDP.  Is that not what you would predict?

Or is the problem that you don't think Bitcoin can reach widespread adoption without users reasonably being able to price goods in BTC?
