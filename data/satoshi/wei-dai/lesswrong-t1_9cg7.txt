I would have agreed with you until the very recent Snowden revelations.  Snowden seems to have revealed secrets that a huge number of people had access to (over a million?), showing its possible for a vast number of people to keep  secrets.  I have a much higher probability that 1,000 or so people could keep a really good secret than I did before.
