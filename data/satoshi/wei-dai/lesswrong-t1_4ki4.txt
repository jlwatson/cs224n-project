Retreating further along the line of Eliezer's reasoning to find the point where you start to disagree: how about AIs that don't take over the world? For example, I want an AI that I can ask for a cheeseburger, and it will produce a cheeseburger for me while respecting my implied wishes to not burn the world with molecular nanotech or kill the neighbor's dog for meat. Do you agree that such a device needs to have lots of specific knowledge about humans, and not just about cheeseburgers? If yes, then how is the goal of solving the world's problems (saving kids in Africa, stopping unfriendly AIs, etc) relevantly different from the goal of making a cheeseburger?
