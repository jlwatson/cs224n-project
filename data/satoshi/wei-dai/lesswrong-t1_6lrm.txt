&gt;Perhaps the paper would be stronger if it explained why philosophers might feel that convergence is probable. For example, in their experience, human philosophers / philosophies converge.

I'm deliberately avoiding that route. If I attack, or mention, moral realism in any form, philosophers are going to get defensive. I'm hoping to skirt the issue by narrowing the connotations of the terms (efficiency rather than intelligence and, especially, rationality).
