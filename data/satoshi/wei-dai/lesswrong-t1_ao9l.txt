There is truth to this sentiment, but you should keep in mind results like [this one](http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/agree-econ.pdf) by Scott Aaronson, that the amount of info that people actually have to transmit is independent of the amount of evidence that they have (even given computational limitations).

It seems like doubting each other's rationality is a perfectly fine explanation. I don't think most people around here are perfectly rational, nor that they think I'm perfectly rational, and definitely not that they all think that I think they are perfectly rational. So I doubt that they've updated enough on the fact that my views haven't converged towards theirs, and they may be right that I haven’t updated enough on the fact that their views haven’t converged towards mine.

In practice we live in a world where many pairs of people disagree, and you have to disagree with a lot of people. I don’t think the failure to have common knowledge is much of a vice, either of me or my interlocutor. It’s just a really hard condition.
