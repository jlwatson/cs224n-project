Wei Dai,

I would prefer to hear the source of your skepticism now, if possible. I anticipate not *actually* disagreeing. I anticipate that we will argue it out and discover that we agree but that my way of expressing my position was not clear to you at first. And then I anticipate using this information to improve the clarity of my future posts.
