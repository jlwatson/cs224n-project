&gt; Minute-by-minute, your thinking and actions are the product of *the matter and energy that is you* moving around and interacting. Specifically, your biochemicals and electricity in your brain have a *huge* impact on your thoughts and actions.

This is an entirely wrong metaphor, for the reasons described in [Explaining vs. Explaining Away](http://lesswrong.com/lw/oo/explaining_vs_explaining_away/) and [Angry Atoms](http://lesswrong.com/lw/p3/angry_atoms/). The fact that you consist of atoms or cells or ants or telepathic dogs doesn't tell *anything* about the amount of control you have over your decisions, minute-by-minute or in the long term.
