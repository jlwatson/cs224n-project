&gt;Please explain.

Chess teaches you to carefully consider the consequences of your available actions and choose the action with the best consequences. Becoming a grand master involves increasing your ability to do this in the domain of chess when you should be generalizing the skill to other applications.

&gt;I wonder if I'm missing something important by not playing chess.

I expect that you in particular managed to learn this skill from other sources.
