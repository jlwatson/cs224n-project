I have a problem with calling this a "semi-open FAI problem", because even if Eliezer's proposed solution turns out to be correct, it's still a wide open problem to develop arguments that can allow us to be confident enough in it to incorporate it into an FAI design. This would be true even if nobody can see any holes in it or have any better ideas, and doubly true given that [some FAI researchers](http://lesswrong.com/lw/h8k/pascals_muggle_infinitesimal_priors_and_strong/8x6z) consider a different approach (which assumes that there is no such thing as "reality-fluid", that everything in the multiverse just exists and as a matter of preference we do not / can not care about all parts of it in equal measure, #4 in [this post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1iy/what_are_probabilities_anyway/)) to be at least as plausible as Eliezer's current approach.
