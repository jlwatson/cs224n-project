A few unrelated points:

1. I tend to agree with you on the first section, but I think I'm less confident about it than you are. :)
2. What is a genuinely utilitarian lifestyle? Is there someone you can cite as living such a lifestyle?
3. I'm not sure what you're talking about in the last sentence. Prevent what from happening to Eliezer? Failing to lose hope when he should? (He wrote a [post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/gx/just_lose_hope_already/) about that, BTW.)
