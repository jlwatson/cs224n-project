Letting a bunch of AIs with given values resolve their disagreement is not the best way to merge values, just like letting the humanity go on as it is is not the best way to preserve human values. As extraction of preference shouldn't depend on the actual "power" or even stability of the given system, merging of preference could also possibly be done directly and more fairly when specific implementations and their "bargaining power" are abstracted away. Such implementation-independent composition/interaction of preference may turn out to be a central idea for the structure of preference.
