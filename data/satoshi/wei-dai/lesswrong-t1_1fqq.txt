This is a traditional objection to the "behaviorism" of philosophers such as Carnap. I recall arguing in an undergraduate term paper that this was a misunderstanding of behaviorism: there is no reason that "behavior" should not encompass e.g. the behavior of neurons, which are in principle just as publicly observable as a subject's verbal behavior. So the question is whether any being could have a brain observably identical to yours and yet have different experiences.
