I don't think it is; you can't even frame it as 'the beginning of the end' because the market doesn't seem perturbed at all - the current *MtGox* rate is $132!

However, this is a good excuse to post an interesting excerpt I found recently as any. On [11 January 2009](http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10152.html), Hal Finney wrote:

&gt; As an amusing thought experiment, imagine that Bitcoin is successful and
becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world.  Then the
total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all
the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household
wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With
20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million. So the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute
time may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million
to 1! Even if the odds of Bitcoin succeeding to this degree are slim,
are they really 100 million to one against? Something to think about...

If Bitcoin goes to $10m per coin, does that mean we get an anti-anti-Pascal's-mugging rhetorical weapon where we can say '100m to one payoffs do exist in the real world, look at Bitcoin!'?
