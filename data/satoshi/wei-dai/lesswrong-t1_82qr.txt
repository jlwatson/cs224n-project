&gt; Do we have any examples of humans successfully navigating an ontological crisis?

I bet a number of LW regulars have done so. I commented earlier (and rather too often) of how my ontology shifted from realism to instrumentalism after the standard definitions of terms "reality" and "existence" proved unsatisfactory for me. Certainly being exposed to the stuff discussed on this forum ought to have had a profound impact at least on some others, as well.
