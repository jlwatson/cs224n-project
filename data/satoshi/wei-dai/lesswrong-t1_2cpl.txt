Why do you want to change minds? Is there any chance that you could abandon that value? Because I believe, paradoxically, that it would help you achieve that same value :-)

I'm probably better than you at general social skills, but the first drafts of my comments sometimes sound disturbingly like yours. Then I notice that excessive subconscious desire to change minds interfered with my clarity of thought, and rethink/rewrite the comment. I want the "ideal commenter me" to never care who said what, who's right and who's wrong, etc. My perfect comment should make a clear, correct, context-free statement that improves the discussion, and do absolutely nothing else. I consciously try to avoid saying things like "you're wrong", saying instead "the statement you propose doesn't work because..." or even better "such-and-such idea doesn't work because...".

Ironically, people do often change their minds when talking to me about topics I understand well. But I'm not setting out to do it. Actually I have an explicit moral system, worked out from painful experience, that says it's immoral for me to try to convince anyone of anything. I try to think correct thoughts and express them clearly, and let other people make conclusions for themselves.
