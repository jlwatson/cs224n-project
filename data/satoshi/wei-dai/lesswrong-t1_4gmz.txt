Your just-so story is more complicated than you seem to think.  It involves an equilibrium of at least two memes: an evangelical utilitarianism which damages the host but propagates the meme, plus a cryptic egoism which presumably benefits the host but can't successfully propagate (it repeatedly arises by spontaneous generation, presumably).  

I could critique your story on grounds of plausibility (which strategy do crypto-egoists suggest to their own children?) but instead I will ask why someone infected by the evangelical utilitarianism meme would argue as you suggested in the great-grandparent:

&gt; "Evolution (memetic evolution, that is) has instilled in me the idea of that I should linearly value the welfare of others regardless of kinship, regardless of what instincts I got from my genes."

Isn't it more likely that someone realizing that they have been subverted by a selfish meme would be trying to self-modify?
