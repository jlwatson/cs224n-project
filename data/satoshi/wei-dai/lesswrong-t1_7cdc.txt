&gt; which fails to credit the importance of strategic contributions

Sorry if that was unclear; I mean to identify the strategists as "philosophers", like [this](http://www.nickbostrom.com/old/predict.html). As you say, I went on to include a large section on strategy.

I certainly agree on the importance of strategy. Most of the research SI and FHI have done is strategic, after all â€” and most of the work in progress is strategic, too. 

I do tend to talk a lot about "hero mathematicians," though. Maybe that's because "hero mathematician" is more concrete (to me) than "hero strategist."

Anyway, it seems like we may be failing to disagree on anything, here.
