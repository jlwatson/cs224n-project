If the definition of "future selves" will not be used to determine who to care about and how much, then it has no consequences on one's decisions, so you might as well say that there is no such thing as future selves, that there is only how much we care about various person-moments, which is essentially arbitrary.

This position seems analogous to position 4 in [What Are Probabilities, Anyway?](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1iy/what_are_probabilities_anyway/), which says there is no such thing as "reality fluid" or "measure" in an objective sense, that there's only how much we care about various universes.

But what if there is such a thing as future selves, or reality fluid? It seems to me in that case we probably want to care more about our future selves, and about universes that have more reality fluid. Shouldn't we keep these questions open until we have better arguments one way or another?
