There are people who know me in person and thus share background knowledge with me, who are able to understand what I am saying. They are the thinkers I admire most and the people I care most about influencing. I have a hypothesis which may just be wrong that people who are particularly good thinkers would notice that I wasn't just insane-in-a-relevant-way and be able to fill in the gaps that would let them understand what I am saying. I have this hypothesis because I think that I have that skill to a large extent, as I believe do others like Michael Vassar or Peter de Blanc or Steve Rayhawk or generally people who bother to train that skill.

I notice that some people who I think are good thinkers, such as yourself, seem to have a low overall estimate of the worthwhileness of my words. However I have accumulated a fair amount of evidence that you do not have the skill of reading (or choose not to exercise the skill of reading), that is, that you err on the side of calling bullshit when I know for certain that something is not bullshit, and rarely err in the opposite direction. If you had to choose a side to be biased towards then that would of course be the correct one, but it isn't clear that such a choice is necessary to be a strong rationalist, as I think is evidenced by Steve Rayhawk, Peter de Blanc, and Michael Vassar (three major influences on my thinking, in descending order of influence.) Thus I do not consider your low estimate of my rationality to be overwhelming evidence that it is in fact impossible to understand what I am trying to say even without sharing much background knowledge with me. I suspect that e.g. Wei Dai has a lowish estimate of my rationality w.r.t. things he is interested in; my model of Wei Dai has him as less curious than you are about things that I yammer about, so my wild guess at his thoughts on the matter are particularly little evidence compared to your thoughts. I plan on getting more information about this in time.
