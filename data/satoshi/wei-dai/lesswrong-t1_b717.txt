I would characterize Eliezer's metaethics slightly differently; I'd say he believes that 'moral facts' as conceived of by humans are a human-specific notion with no relevance to any other type of mind, but that they exist, and that he would place it between 2 and 3. Or more specifically, he'd endorse 3 with the caveat that if you restrict the domain of 'everyone' to humans, 2 would also be true.

I'd tentatively agree but don't feel informed enough to have a strong opinion or motivated to form one.
