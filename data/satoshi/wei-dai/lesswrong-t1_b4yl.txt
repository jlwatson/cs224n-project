$100,000 is a very small amount of money for smart people in finance, certainly not something they would spend a lot of time trying to get.  It's certainly possible that if you are very smart, have a bit of specialized information on some topic, have smart associates willing to give you advice, and are willing to devote, say, 100 hours you could find a $100k bill on the ground.
