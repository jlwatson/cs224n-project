Wei Dai's wording makes it sound like identity formation is something LW is placing special emphasis on, which doesn't appear to me to be the case. Forming identities based on the places you spend time is just what people do by default, and I am pessimistic about the possibilities for preventing this. Maybe everyone should read [Keep Your Identity Small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) every morning. Also, it might not be a bad idea for us to stop using the word "rationalist."
