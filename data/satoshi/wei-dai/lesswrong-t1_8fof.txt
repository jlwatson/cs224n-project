The conclusion is that the effects of progress are small compared with anything that has an appreciable effect on the future (for someone with aggregative, time-insensitive values). If we break down an action as the sum of two changes---one parallel to progress, one orthogonal to it---the effects of the orthogonal part are typically going to be much larger than the effects of the parallel part.

Originally I ended with a discussion of x-risk reduction, but it became unwieldy and I didn't want to put time in. Perhaps I should end with a link to some discussion of future-shaping elsewhere.
