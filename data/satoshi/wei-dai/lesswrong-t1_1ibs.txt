That's not necessarily true. We might still have to build a sturdy bridge to cross a river, it's just that nobody dies if we mess up. 

Likewise, if one's mind is too advanced for bridge building to not be boring, then there will be other more complex organizations we would want, which the FAI is under no obligation to hand us. 

I think we can have a huge set of real problems to solve, even after FAI solves all the *needed* ones.
