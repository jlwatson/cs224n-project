I find it difficult to see any trace of the idea in Euclid. Circles and straight lines, yes, but any abstract idea of shape in general, if it can be read into geometry at all, would only be in the modern axiomatisation. And done by mathematicians finding actual theorems, not by philosophers assuming there is an actual thing behind our use of the word, that it is their task to discover.
