I use "I think X" to indicate more uncertainty than just "X" all the time, and so does Eliezer. I just checked his recent comments, and on the first page, he used "I think" two times to indicate uncertainty, and one time to indicate that others may not share his belief. The statement "Consider the following deflations, all of which convey essentially the same information about your own opinions" just seems plain wrong.
