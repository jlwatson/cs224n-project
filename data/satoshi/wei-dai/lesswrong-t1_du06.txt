How does value scale with brain size? For example, if we had enough atoms to build 10 human-like brains, is it better to do that or to build a giant brain that can have much more complex thoughts and experiences? Are there experiences that we can't imagine today that are many times more valuable than what we can imagine, without even using more atoms? Also consider questions like population ethics and egoism vs altruism, e.g., should we use the rest of the universe to create more lives (if so how many), or to extend/improve the lives of existing people?

For something to count as a utopia for me, it would have to allow me to become smarter, answer these questions, then have the answers make a meaningful difference in the world. Otherwise, it could still be an AI disaster relative to the potential of the universe.
