So you're saying that my AI (with infinite computational power) would never discover the existence of tulips?

&gt;(On a different note, "Are tulips in the territory?" sounds like a question about definitions.

I don't intend it to be. I think tulips exist, unlike shmulips (similar to tulips, except they have golf balls instead of flowers), which don't. I don't think I have a firm grip on the map-territory distinction, but I was trying to use it in the way Wei was using it. 

Anyway, here's the basis of my question: tulips do exist. They're real, mind independent things and they are part of the furniture of the universe. Any god or AI who came into our universe would have an incomplete understanding of this universe if they failed to include tulips in their story.

That said, is the complete story of our universe derivable from a complete story of the ontological primitives (plus whatever logic you wish to avail yourself of)? I'm not totally sure that's a well formed question, mind you.
