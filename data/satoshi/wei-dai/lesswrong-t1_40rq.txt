I doubt RichardKennaway believes Wei_Dai is unfit for inclusion in the human race. What he was saying, and what he received upvotes for, is that anyone who's blandly willing to murder millions of non-combatants of a friendly power in peacetime because they do not accede to empire-building is unfit for inclusion in the human race - and he's right, that sort of person *should not* be fit for inclusion in the human race. A comment on LW *is not* the same as that bland willingness to slaughter, and you do yourself no favours by incorrectly paraphrasing it as such.
