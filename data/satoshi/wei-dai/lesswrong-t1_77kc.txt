&gt; Wedrifid, I really don't like getting into these exchanges with you. 

I don't recall having any significant exchanges with you---I don't doubt that it could have happened. 

It may be useful for you to consider that this exchange is *yours*. You took the podium at the forum (in the traditional sense) and made a speech denouncing your enemies, supporting your allies and advocating a certain ideas. Then many people (in this case myself among them) replied with their own denunciations, support or advocacy. A good rule of thumb is that when you tell a group of people not to do what they have chosen to do you will get some replies, unless for some reason you have the power to suppress dissent. You don't have to reply to them. You don't even have to read them---you are not the primary audience and nobody really expects to convince the original speaker that they are wrong. But the replies will (and should) be made nonetheless.

&gt; You seem to have more time for it

I sincerely wish I did. There is a lot going on in the dynamics of this situation that relates to and [threatens](http://lesswrong.com/lw/nb/something_to_protect/) virtues and ideals that I value and---at least on lesswrong where it is usually safe to do so---hold sacred. If I wanted to protect those ideals effectively I would of course have to go ahead and write my own post but for me writing eloquent posts takes a lot of time and initiative. 

&gt; You seem to think that you can deliberately mislead people and still be honest.

That is one way to be sure I remember you. The misleading usage of out of context quotes. I tend to recall all those who use this particular interpersonal tactic, whether against myself or others. Call it a pet peeve. Sometimes I've even provided an iterating counter. In this case I *completely endorse* the [comment you link to](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2r/really_extreme_altruism/43ao). It is a straightforward renunciation of [inflationary use of terms](http://lesswrong.com/lw/coo/avoid_inflationary_use_of_terms/). 

&gt; So, I stand by my assertion that it is worth engaging with 80K by providing them with questions we would like them to answer

Nobody (that I have noticed) has said anything to the contrary. I stand by Eliezer's [exhortation](http://lesswrong.com/lw/c1/wellkept_gardens_die_by_pacifism/):
