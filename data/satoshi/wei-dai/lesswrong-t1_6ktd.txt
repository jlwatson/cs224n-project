Huh.  I had never explicitly noticed that one could acquire [side loading](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/03/egans-zendegi.html) data in the present.  Nor have I seen an information theoretic analysis of brain contents that was so plausible and so low.  This seems like it might be important but I'll have to ponder implications for a while.  Thank you for posting this :-)
