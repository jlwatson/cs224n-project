Not sure if this is the crux of the issue, but if the lottery fails to pay off, you lose the interest on the $100 in addition to the $100 itself, and in order to get to $1 million, you'd have to make up for it by working more than 1.1 hour at the end of 5.5 years. Is there a way to change the numbers to make your argument work out even after taking this into account?
