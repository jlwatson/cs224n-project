While searching for literature on "intuition", I came upon a book chapter that gives "the state of the art in moral psychology from a social-psychological perspective". This is the best summary I've seen of how morality actually works in human beings.

The authors gives out the chapter for free by email request, but to avoid that [trivial inconvenience](http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/), I've put up a [mirror](http://www.ibiblio.org/weidai/temp/haidt.kesebir.2010.morality.handbook-of-social-psych.pub077.pdf) of it.
