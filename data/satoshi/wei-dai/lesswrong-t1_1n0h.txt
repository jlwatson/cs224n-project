I think part of the point of what you call "moral anti-realism" is that it frees up words like "evil" so that they can refer to people who have particular kinds of "should function", since there's nothing cosmic that the word could be busy referring to instead.

If I had to offer a demonology, I guess I might loosely divide evil minds into: 1) those capable of serious moral reflection but avoiding it, e.g. because they're busy wallowing in negative other-directed emotion, 2) those engaging in serious moral reflection but making cognitive mistakes in doing so, 3) those whose moral reflection genuinely outputs behavior that strongly conflicts with (the extension of) one's own values. I think 1 comes closest to what's traditionally meant by "evil", with 2 being more "misguided" and 3 being more "Lovecraftian". As I understand it, CEV is problematic if most people are "Lovecraftian" but less so if they're merely "evil" or "misguided", and I think you may in general be too quick to assume Lovecraftianity. (ETA: one main reason why I think this is that I don't see many people actually retaining values associated with wrong belief systems when they abandon those belief systems; do you know of many atheists who think atheists or even Christians should burn in hell?)
