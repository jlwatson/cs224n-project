I certainly didn't say that would be risk-free, but it interacts with other drag factors on very high estimates of risk. In the full-length discussion of it, I pair it with discussion of historical lags in tech development between leader and follower in technological arms races (longer than one month) and factors relative to corporate and international espionage, raise the possibility of global coordination (or at least between the leader and next closest follower), and so on.

It also interacts with technical achievements in producing 'domesticity' short of exact unity of will.

When strategy A to a large extent can capture the impacts of strategy B.
