It seems essential to the idea of "a coherent direction for steering the world" or "preferences" that the ordering between choices does not depend on what choices are actually available. But in [standard cooperative multi-agent decision procedures](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2x8/lets_split_the_cake_lengthwise_upwise_and/), the ordering *does* depend on the set of choices available. How to make sense of this? Does it mean that a group of more than one agent can't be said to have a coherent direction for steering the world? What is it that they do have then? And if a human should be viewed as a group of sub-agents representing different values and/or moral theories, does it mean a human also doesn't have such a coherent direction?
