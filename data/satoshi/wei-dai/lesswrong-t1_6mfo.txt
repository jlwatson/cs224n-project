It still looks to me like arguing about a wrong question. We use words to communicate with each other, which requires that by and large we learn to use the same words in similar ways.  There are interesting questions to ask about how we do this, but questions of a sort that require doing real work to discover answers. To philosophically ask, "Ah, but what what *sort of thing* is a meaning? What are meanings? What is the process of referring?" is nugatory.

It is as if one were to look at the shapes that crystals grow into and ask not, "What mechanisms produce these shapes?" (a question answered in the laboratory, not the armchair, by discovering that atoms bind to each other in ways that form orderly lattices), but "What is a shape?"
