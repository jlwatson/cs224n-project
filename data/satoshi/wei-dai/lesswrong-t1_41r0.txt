Mine says the same thing. But I guess it's due to insufficient imagination, not insufficient understanding of (meta-)morality. A village girl coming to New York for the first time may have a vague preconceived idea of what kind of awesome dresses she's gonna buy, but before she buys one, she needs to do some actual shopping :-) It doesn't take a genius to imagine some pretty good outcomes for humanity. But finding the best one requires imagination.
