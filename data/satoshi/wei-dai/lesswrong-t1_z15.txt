I'm reminded of the medieval "point of honor" that nobles were entitled to and commoners weren't. Perceiving an offense and successfully thwarting it is a karma mint, so seeking out offense makes sense, especially if other people will likely support you. Not without its harms, of course, because social status is much like a zero-sum game - especially in conflict situations.

Not convinced at all that "offense" is meaningfully different from "righteous anger". It's pretty clear that one of those concepts is meant to be pigeonholed as good and the other as bad, and people are trying to invent a reasonable-sounding definition that would facilitate such pigeonholing; but that's already reason enough for me to discount the whole discussion.
