Need to use complexity theory to try and see how powerful the super-intelligence has to be. It may end up that it will need to be substantially bigger than Jupiter Brain (cubed, squared, to 100th power?) to construct anything relevant to self preservation, from such a coarse data set. As intuition pump, and I said that before, a computing system that is to mankind as mankind is to 1 amoeba should be expected to predict the weather for about two times longer than mankind can - that's given perfect information - given limited information the gain may be quite small and entirely unimportant. For the coarse brain scans to detailed brain state, one has to somehow run simulation in reverse (or worse yet, bruteforce the state), which I think explodes even worse than forward butterfly effect. I'd say we don't know enough about brain to be able to tell what it takes to do this kind of thing, but what we do know about chaotic non-linear systems in general, does not inspire optimism.

The jump that if might be possible in principle, it would therefore be doable by super-intelligence, only works if you think theological thoughts about AI.
