And I can apologize again if that helps!

Actually I often feel kinda bad about people upvoting my comments when they contain subtle mistakes I can see in hindsight. I felt this way about my comments in the previous thread even before I saw lucidfox's current post... Anything that drives away a thoughtful user certainly counts as a mistake and I'll try to update my sentence generators to avoid repeating it.
