&gt; It's not clear to me that these attributes are strongly (or even positively) correlated with willingness to "stick up" for a conversation partner, since typically this behavioral tendency has more to do with whether a person is socially aggressive or timid. So by doing that, you're mostly signaling that you're not timid

This model of the world does an injustice to a class of people I hold in high esteem (those who are willing to defend others against certain types of social aggression even at cost to themselves) and doesn't seem to be a very accurate description of reality. A lot of information - and information I consider important at that - can be gained about a person simply by seeing who they choose to defend in which circumstances. Sure, excessive 'timidity' can serve to suppress this kind of behavior and so information can be gleaned about social confidence and assertiveness by seeing how freely they intervene. But to take this to the extreme of saying you are mostly signalling that you're not timid seems to be a mistake.

In my own experience - from back when I was timid in the extreme - the sort of "sticking up for", jumping to the defense against (unfair or undesirable) aggression is one thing that could break me out of my shell. To say that my defiance of my nature at that time was really just me being not timid after all would be to make a lie of the battle of rather significant opposing forces within the mind of that former self.

&gt; (This is the impression I have of wedrifid, for example.)

Merely that I am bold and that my behavioral tendencies and strategies in this kind of area are just signals of that boldness? Dave's model seems far more accurate and useful in this case.
