There are gains from cooperating with as many others as possible. Maybe these and other factors outweigh the risk or maybe they don't; the lower the probability and extent of Lovecraftianity, the more likely it is that they do.

Anyway, I'm not making any claims about what to do, I'm just saying people probably aren't as Lovecraftian as Roko thinks, which I conclude both from introspection and from the statistics of what moral change we actually see in humans.
