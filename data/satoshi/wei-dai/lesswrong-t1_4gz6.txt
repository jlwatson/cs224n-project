A utilitarian might well be indifferent to the self-serving nature of the the meme.  But, as I recall, you brought up the question in response to my suggestion that my own (genetic) instincts derive a kind of nobility from their origin in the biological process of natural selection for organism fitness.  Would our hypothetical utilitarian be proud of the origin of his meme in the cultural process of selection for meme self-promotion?
