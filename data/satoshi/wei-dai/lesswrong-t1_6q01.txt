I've only read your comment, not anything by Peterson, so I'm just asking for clarification on what he claims to do:

In your first quote of him, he claims to derive utilities from a certain kind of subjective probability.  But does he also claim to make the converse derivation?  That is, does he also claim to derive those same subjective probabilities from utilities as you do in your final paragraph?  It's not clear to me that your first quote of him commits him to doing this.
