&gt;If I were a professional philosopher working in anthropic reasoning, I don't see how I can justify not taking a paper about anthropic reasoning seriously 

Depends on how many cranks there are in anthropic reasoning (lots) and how many semi-serious people post ideas that have already been addressed or refuted in papers already (in philosophy in general, this is huge; in anthropic reasoning, I'm not sure).
