The main relevant aspect of the real problem not captured by quining is the continuity of self-replacement with environmental action.  All the quining approaches Marcello and I considered, involved differently treating the decisions to "modify self" and "do something in environment".  This means you can't use actions to construct an environmental copy of yourself out of transistors, because the environmental copy wouldn't get the privileged-special-case treatment.  More generally, it seems to imply an arbitrary Cartesian boundary with different levels of mathematical trust for physical processes inside and outside the boundary.  And that you can't just frame desirable actions in terms of their predicted consequences.

Edit:  This doesn't mean quining approaches aren't worth exploring.  They might get us closer to a solution than contemplating, say, approaches that *don't* quine.
