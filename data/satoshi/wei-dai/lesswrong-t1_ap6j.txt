With humans like this, we don't need the Unfriendly AI:

[Could we condemn criminals to suffer for hundreds of years? Biotechnology could let us extend convicts' lives 'indefinitely'](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2580828/Could-soon-create-hell-EARTH-Biotechnology-let-extend-criminals-lives-makes-suffering-HUNDREDS-years.html)

&gt; Last year, a team of scientists led by Rebecca Roache began exploring technologies that could keep prisoners in an artificial hell. Turning to human engineering as a possible solutions, Dr Roache looks at the idea of life span enhancements so that a life sentence in prison could last hundreds of years. Another scenario being explored by the group is uploading the criminal's mind to a digital realm to speed up the 1,000 year sentence.

She teaches [ethics, bioethics](http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/staff/staff/research_fellows/rebecca_roache), and [rationality](http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/members/archive/rebecca_roache). Perhaps she could write for us a new Sequence on Hell Theory.
