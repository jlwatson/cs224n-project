Agreed, but what I'm mostly griping about is when people who *know* that utility functions are a really inaccurate model still go ahead and use it, even if prefaced by some number of standard caveats. "Goal system", for example, conveys a similar abstract idea without all of the questionable and misleading technical baggage (let alone associations with "utilitarianism"), and is more amenable to case-specific caveats. I don't think we should downvote people for talking about utility functions, especially if they're newcomers, but there's a point at which we have to adopt generally higher standards for which concepts we give low K complexity in our language. 

I have a vested interested in this. All of the most interesting meta-ethics and related decision theory I've seen thus far has come from people associated with SingInst or Less Wrong. If we are to continue to be a gathering place for that kind of mind we can't let our standards degenerate, and ideally we should be aiming for improvement. From far away it would be way easy to dismiss Less Wrong as full of naive nerds completely ignorant of both philosophy and psychology. From up close it would be easy to dismiss Less Wrong as overly confident in a suspiciously homogeneous set of philosophically questionable meta-ethical beliefs, e.g. some form of utilitarianism. The effects of such appearances are hard to calculate and I think larger than most might intuit. (The extent to which well-meaning folk of an ideology very influenced by Kurzweil have poisoned the well for epistemic-hygienic or technical discussion of technological singularity scenarios, for instance, seems both very large and very saddening.)
