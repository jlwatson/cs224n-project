&gt;To those who say they don't want to be wireheaded, how do you really know that, when you haven't tried wireheading?

Same reason I don't try heroin. Wireheading (as generally conceived) imposes a predictable change on the user's utility function; huge and irreversible. Gathering this information is not without cost.
