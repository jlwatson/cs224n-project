&gt; This topic probably deserves more thought than I've put into it, but it seems to me that you can tell what things are ontologically primitive in in reality by looking at what objects the fundamental laws of physics keep track of and directly operate upon. For example in Newtonian physics these would be individual particles, and in Quantum Mechanics it would just be the wavefunction.

The problem is that different equivalent formulations will make different things ontologically primitive.

&gt; (Of course at this point we don't know what the fundamental laws of physics actually are so we can't say what things are ontologically primitive yet, but it seems pretty clear that it can't be human beings.)

How do you know there is a fundamental level, as opposed something like a [void cathedral](http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/47576afe8e770)?
