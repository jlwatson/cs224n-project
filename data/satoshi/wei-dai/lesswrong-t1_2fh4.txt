That would feel a bit like hijacking. The obvious candidates for writing such a post are Eliezer, Gary Drescher, or Wei Dai. I don't know why they aren't doing that, probably they feel that surveying the existing literature is quite enough to make yourself confused. I'll think about your suggestion, though. If I find an honest and accessible angle, I'll write a post.
