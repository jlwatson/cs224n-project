One thing that bothers me about LW is that comments and discussion posts had their karma divided by ten (rather than some more moderate number). Surely that has to have taken away too much of the incentive to post good comments, as well as made karma less informative as the measure of general quality of thought that [some](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/5ro/what_bothers_you_about_less_wrong/47j7) are taking it for.
