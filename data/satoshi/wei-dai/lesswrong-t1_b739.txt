I'm not getting the essential difference between (3) and (4).  It seems like (4) is just a special case of (3), in that (4)'s "process of reflection [that] is convergent at the individual level" could just be (3)'s "how to translate non-preferences ... into preferences".

Is the difference that, if (3) held, then there could be only *one* correct "process of reflection" of the kind described in (4), so that this one process would be the only correct path for all pre-rational intelligent agents to take to become rational?
