&gt;But I'd prefer to look at another assumption: the idea that a general intelligence will really be formidable in multiple domains, and that one of the best ways of accomplishing a goal in a particular domain is to construct a general intelligence and let it specialise.

This assumption explains why evolution hasn't already filled all the economic and ecological niches with species of specialized intelligence, that humans are able to specialize into. If the assumption is false, then there would have to be another explanation for this fact. Are there any proposals on the table?
