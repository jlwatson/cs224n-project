&gt; other "educational gimmicks" are simply misguided - including many attempts at "gamification".

A typical example of "gamification" seems to be too much about external rewards: points, awards, visual effects and music. That may be a nice bonus, but it does not address the essence.

I think the correct approach is to explore the [zone of proximal development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development) using a playful [setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setting_(narrative\)). For example, you could teach addition by talking about dinosaurs walking in a forest, how groups of dinosaurs meet, and they need to know how many dinosaurs are now in the joined group. The child gets hooked on the dinosaur narrative, but you are still doing perfectly valid math.

These two things are about as different as a slot machine and a role-playing game. They may seem similar to someone who doesn't understand the details and merely learned "make it more fun" as an aplause light.
