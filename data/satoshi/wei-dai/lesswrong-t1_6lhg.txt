Yes, to deny it requires more meta-philosophical knowledge than we currently possess. But to affirm it as likely requires more meta-philosophical knowledge than we currently possess. My purpose is to show that it's very unlikely, not that it's impossible.

Do you feel I didn't make that point? Should I have addressed "moral realism" explicitly? I didn't want to put down the words, because it raises defensive hackles if I start criticising a position directly.
