&gt; "You're deciding the logical fact that the program-that-is-you makes a certain output."

There is no need to focus on these concepts. That the fact of decision is "logical" doesn't usefully characterize it: if we talk about the "physical" fact of making a decision, then everything else remains the same, you'd just need to see what this physical event implies about decisions made by your near-copies elsewhere (among the normal consequences). Likewise, pointing to a physical event doesn't require conceptualizing a "program" or even an "agent" that computes the state of this event, you could just specify coordinates in spacetime and work on figuring out what's there (roughly speaking).

(It's of course convenient to work with abstractly defined structures, in particular decisions generated by programs (rather than abstractly defined in a more general way), and at least with mathematical structuralism in mind working with abstract structures looks like the right way of describing things in general.)
