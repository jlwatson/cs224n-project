&gt;  It would take a lot of time to inform everyone and change my registrations on various shopping sites, etc., and I'll probably still lose a bunch of emails.

If they're willing to pay $100k, they're willing to forward emails for a few years.

&gt; Lots of links to my site from other sites, which I can't change easily or at all.

Linkrot is high enough on the Internet that in a few years, all the damage will be repaired. You also have few enough pages you may be able to arrange redirects for individual pages. (I've read through everything on the site - it's not *that* big.)

&gt; weidai.com has historically produced very high returns.

No, *having a site* has historically produced very high returns. Not having the exact domain name. (Unless you mean something like 'I made a fortune off someone who told me they randomly typed in the exact domain name 'weidai.com' and decided to name me in their will'.)

&gt; I do have an emotional attachment to the domain now that I've owned it for so many years

Can't argue with this one. On the other hand, I'd be thrilled to sell `gwern.net` for $100k; money makes an excellent salve for hurt feelings.

&gt; If it is a bias, overcoming it takes effort, which might be more productively directed towards other goals, like writing a LW post about looking for the next tech gold rush

How long does it take to sell a domain name and set up shop on `weidai.net` or whatever? Let's say 3 or 4 weeks of nonstop work. You really think you are currently producing ~$100k of value with your current lifestyle and work patterns each 4 weeks in which you ignore selling the domain?
