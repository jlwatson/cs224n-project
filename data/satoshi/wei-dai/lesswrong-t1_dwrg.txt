&gt; I guess that also includes you, who haven't followed your own advice?

Yeah. When I was working actively on MIRI math, I picked up the idea that getting stuff peer reviewed is nice but not necessary for progress. My opinion changed in the last couple years, when I was already mostly away. The strategy I'd suggest now is to try to join the academic conversation on their terms, as I did at the [Cambridge conference](https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/events/decision-theory-conf). Ideally, getting publications in journals should be part of that.

I haven't thought much about talking to funders, good to hear you're pursuing that.
