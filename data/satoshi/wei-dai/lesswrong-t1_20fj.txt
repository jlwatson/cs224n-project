Even if you don't like or care about social games, other things you may care about can depend on them, such as:

* Not getting bullied or pushed around by other people
* Finding mates outside a narrow nerdy minority of people
* Networking
* Business and job negotiation

For social games to truly not matter, you need to have a very narrow preference set where you not only don't care for social games, but you don't need or want anything that can be achieved by them. It would be like not caring about money, and also not caring about anything money can buy you. It's possible to have that preference set; it's just a tall order. 

A large amount of doors in neurotypical society are closed to you if you can't play social games at some level. I would speculate that for many people who think they don't care about silly things like social games, those very social games actually *do* impact other things they care about, and they are either unaware of that impact or in denial about it.
