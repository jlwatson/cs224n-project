I don't really think we want *major* publicity. A community can only absorb [so many people](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Eternal_September) at a time, especially when it's a huge vast sprawling mess of material like LW is. Ideally what we would get is a steady stream of low-level publicity in our natural recruiting grounds like _Wired_ - but not headliners.

(One of the worst things to ever happen to Wikipedia, [in my belief](http://www.gwern.net/In%20Defense%20Of%20Inclusionism), was getting headline publicity - as part of the [Seigenthaler affair](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia_biography_controversy).)
