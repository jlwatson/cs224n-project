Yes, *formalizing Friendliness* is not the sort of thing you'd want one person doing.  I agree.  I don't consider that "philosophy", and it's the sort of thing other FAI team members would have to be able to check.  We probably want at least one high-grade actual cryptographer.

Of the others, the nonperson predicate and the moral-progress parts are the main ones where it'd be unusually hard to solve and then tell that it had been solved correctly.  I would expect both of those to be factorable-out, though - that all or most of the solution could just be published outright.  (Albeit recent experience with trolls makes me think that no insight enabling conscious simulations should ever be published; people would write suffering conscious simulations and run them just to show off... how confident they were that the consciousness theory was wrong, or something.  I have a newfound understanding of the utter... do-anything-ness of trolls.  This potentially makes it hard to publicly check some parts of the reasoning behind a nonperson predicate.)  Anthropic reasoning / "reality fluid" is the sort of thing I'd expect to be really obvious in retrospect once solved.  R1 and R2 should be both obvious in retrospect, and publishable.

I have hopes that an upcoming post on the Lob Problem will offer a much more concrete picture of what some parts of the innards of FAI development and formalizing look like.
