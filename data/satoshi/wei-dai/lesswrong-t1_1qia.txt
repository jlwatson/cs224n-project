I'm staying out of this discussion mainly because I'm incredibly confused about acausal/timeless/counterfactual trade/blackmail. Eliezer gave a small presentation at the recent decision theory mini-workshop on his ideas but unlike Stuart I'm pretty sure I *don't* understand it. I've been told there are also some very rough notes/drafts on related ideas written by a couple of individuals floating around SIAI and FHI, but so far I have been unsuccessful in getting access to them.

ETA: I should mention that the workshop was very enjoyable and I greatly appreciate SIAI's efforts in setting it up, even though I came out more confused than I did going in. That just means I wasn't confused nearly enough previously. :)
