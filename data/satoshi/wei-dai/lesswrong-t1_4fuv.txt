I'm not sure what it means to say that people have the same concept of morality but disagree on many of its most fundamental properties. Do you know how to elucidate that?

I tried to explain some of the cause of persistent moral debate (as opposed to e.g. sound debate) in [this way](http://lesswrong.com/lw/5kn/conceptual_analysis_and_moral_theory/):

&gt; The problem may be worse for moral terms than for (say) art terms. Moral terms have more powerful connotations than art terms, and are thus a greater attractor for sneaking in connotations. Moral terms are used to persuade. "It's just wrong!" the moralist cries, "I don't care what definition you're using right now. It's just wrong: don't do it."

&gt; Moral discourse is rife with motivated cognition. This is part of why, I suspect, people resist dissolving moral debates even while they have no trouble dissolving the 'tree falling in a forest' debate.
