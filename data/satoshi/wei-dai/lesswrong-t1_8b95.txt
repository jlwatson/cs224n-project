I certainly intend to try that recruiting thing (Paul Christiano ain't half bad) but recruiting philosophy seems much less straightforward than recruiting mathematical talent.  If I have to resolve it all myself, I wouldn't flinch from trying.  It seems like that part should be less difficult in an absolute sense than the rest of the labor, though that might just be comparative advantage talking.  The resolutions to philosophical confusions usually seem relatively straightforward once you have them, in my experience so far.
