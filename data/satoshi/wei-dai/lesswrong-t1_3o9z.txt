Al always, I'm not sure if I completely understand your question, but here's a stab at an answer anyway.

Evolution made us care about allies and kin, and also about other humans because they could become allies, or because caring is sometimes good for your image. But first you need to determine what a human is. Right now it's a safe bet to say that the humans I interact with are all conscious. So if some entity has a chance of not being conscious, I begin to doubt it's really a human and if I should care about it. An analogy: if I encounter a blue banana, I'll have second thoughts about eating it, even though evolution didn't give me a hardcoded drive to desire yellow bananas only. Yellowness (or consciousness) is just empirically correlated with the things evolution wants me to care about.
