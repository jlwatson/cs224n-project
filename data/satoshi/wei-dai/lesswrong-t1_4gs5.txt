&gt;The problem here is with the second conjunct - wants (etc.) are not naturalistic.

Suppose I hear Bob say "I want to eat an apple." Am I justified in assigning a higher probability to "Bob wants to eat an apple" after I hear this than before (assuming I don't have some other evidence to the contrary, like someone is holding a gun to Bob's head)? Assuming the answer is yes, and given that "Bob said 'I want to eat an apple.'" is a naturalistic fact, how did I learn something non-naturalistic from that?
