Eliezer's metaethics might be clarified in terms of the distinctions between [sense, reference, and reference-fixing descriptions](http://www.philosophyetc.net/2004/09/naming-and-necessity.html).  I take it that Eliezer wants to use 'right' as a rigid designator to denote some particular set of terminal values, but this reference fact is fixed by means of a seemingly 'relative' procedure (namely, whatever terminal values the speaker happens to hold, on some appropriate [if somewhat mysterious] idealization).  Confusions arise when people mistakenly read this *metasemantic* subjectivism into the first-order semantics or *meaning* of 'right'.

**In summary:**

(i) 'Right' means, roughly, 'promotes external goods X, Y and Z'

(ii) claim i above is true *because* I desire X, Y, and Z.

Note that [Speakers Use Their Actual Language](http://www.philosophyetc.net/2006/09/speakers-use-their-actual-language.html), so murder would still be wrong even if I had the desires of a serial killer.  But if I had those violent terminal values, I would speak a slightly different language than I do right now, so that when KillerRichard asserts "Murder is right!" what he says is true.  We don't really disagree, but are instead merely talking past each other.

**Virtues of the theory:**

(a) By rigidifying on our actual, current desires (or idealizations thereupon), it avoids [Inducing Desire Satisfactions](http://www.philosophyetc.net/2008/07/inducing-desire-satisfactions.html).

(b) Shifting the subjectivity out to the metasemantic level leaves us with a first-order semantic proposal that at least does a better job than simple subjectivism at 'saving the phenomena'.  (It has echoes of Mark Schroeder's desire-based view of reasons, according to which the facts that give us reasons are the propositional *contents* of our desires, rather than the *desires* themselves. Or something like that.)

(c) It's naturalistic, if you find moral non-naturalism 'spooky'.  (Though I'd sooner recommend Mackie-style error theory for naturalists, since I don't think (b) above is *enough* to save the phenomena.) 

**Objections**

(1) It's incompatible with the datum that substantive, fundamental normative disagreement is in fact possible.  People may share the concept of a normative *reason*, even if they fundamentally disagree about which features of actions are the ones that give us reasons.

(2) The semantic tricks merely shift the lump under the rug, they don't get rid of it.  Standard worries about relativism re-emerge, e.g. an agent can know *a priori* that their own fundamental values are right, given how the meaning of the word 'right' is determined.  This kind of (even merely 'fundamental') infallibility seems implausible.

(3) Just as simple subjectivism is an implausible theory of what 'right' means, so Eliezer's meta-semantic subjectivism is an implausible theory of *why 'right' means promoting external goods X, Y, Z*.  An adequately objective metaethics shouldn't even give preferences a reference-fixing role.
