Well, not quite that old, but yes, not very recent. The [internet archive](http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090801000000*/http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/wiki/So_You_Want_To_Be_A_Seed_AI_Programmer) says the page was created at the end of 2009, but it was probably not done by EY himself. The earliest reference google gives is in 2007...

So, you're saying, now the party line is on single-level formal system-style architectures? But does it even make sense to try to define FAI-meaningful concepts in such architecture? Isn't it like trying to define 'love', 'freedom', and 'justice' in terms of atoms?

I remember EY saying somewhere (can't find where now) that AIXI design was very commendable in the sense that here finally is a full AGI design that can be clearly shown to kill you :)
