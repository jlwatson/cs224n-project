&gt;"I privately have better arguments but I can't share them because they would be too inflammatory".

I have privately discussed the arguments and found them convincing enough to move my position over the past year much more in his direction. 

The best course of action is perhaps a correspondence with assured privacy? The problem is that one to one correspondences are time consuming and have their own weaknesses as a means to approaching truth seeking. I tried to get more open discussion of such arguments on a mailing list but as your probably know most didn't participate or write enough material to make reasoning explicit in ways they do in regular correspondence. 

Also I felt this important enough to say to break my one month streak of staying off LW, I will now (hopefully) resume it.
