&gt;Over the coming weeks, I intend to write up a history of the different parts of the effective altruist movement and their interrelations.

I'd be interested to read that. I'm also curious about the relationship between EA and "traditional" charities and philanthropists. Given that for example the Gates Foundation gives out billions of dollars in grants per year while the top charities recommended by GiveWell only have room for funding in the low millions per year, what is stopping the Gates Foundation from maxing out their room for funding? Are they not aware of GiveWell? Do they disagree with its analyses, or its philosophy, if so how or why?
