If Holden believes that:    
A) reducing existential risk is valuable, and   
B) SI's effectiveness at reducing existential risk is a significant contributor to the future of existential risk, and   
C) SI is being less effective at reducing existential risk than they would be if they fixed some set of problems P, and  
D) withholding GiveWell's endorsement while pre-committing to re-evaluating that refusal if given evidence that P has been fixed increases the chances that SI will fix P...

...it seems to me that Holden should withhold GiveWell's endorsement while pre-committing to re-evaluating that refusal if given evidence that P has been fixed.   

Which seems to be what he's doing. (Of course, I don't know whether those are his reasons.)

What, on your view, ought he do instead, if he believes those things?
