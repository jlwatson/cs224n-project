That is interesting to me because finding out I am largely a status maximizer (and that others are as well) has been one of the most valuable bits of information I've learned from OB/LW. This was especially true at work, where I realized I needed to be maximizing my status explicitly as a goal and not feel bad about it, which allowed me to do so far more efficiently.
