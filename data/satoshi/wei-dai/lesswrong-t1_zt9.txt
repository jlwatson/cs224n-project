That was an answer for your question about what should you replace CDT with. If you won't be able to convince other agents that you now run on timeless CDT, you gain a little smaller advantage than otherwise, but that's a separate problem. If you know that your claims of precommitment won't be believed, you don't precommit, it's that easy. But sometimes, you'll find a better solution than if you only lived in a moment.

Also note that even if you do convince other agents about the abstract fact that your decision theory is now timeless, it won't help you very much, since it doesn't prove that you'll precommit in a specific situation. You only precommit in a given situation if you know that this action makes the situation better for you, which in case of cooperation means that the other side will be able to tell whether you actually precommited, and this is not at all the same as being able to tell what decision theory you use.

Since using a decision theory with precommitment is almost always an advantage, it's easy to assume that a sufficiently intelligent agent always uses something of the sort, but that doesn't allow you to know more about their actions -- in fact, you know less, since such agent has more options now.
