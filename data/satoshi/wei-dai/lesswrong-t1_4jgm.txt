Reflective equilibrium is [usually](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reflective-equilibrium/) described in terms of "considered judgments" or "intuitions". (Your own FAQ uses "intuitions".) Do we gain any new insights (or other benefits) from thinking about reflective equilibrium in terms of "tendencies" instead?
