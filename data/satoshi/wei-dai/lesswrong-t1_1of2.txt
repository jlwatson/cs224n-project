It is always possible to create ambiguity if ambiguity is what you seek - "they" is no richer a source of such than any other. I don't think either of us is going to convince the other to change their mode of speech (no flaunting of my particular preference intended).

Edit: How did you find out that Chris lost their money without finding out Chris's gender, anyway? I don't advocate singular-they in cases where you *know* the gender.
