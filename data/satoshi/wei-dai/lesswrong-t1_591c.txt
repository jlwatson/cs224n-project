Given enough computing power, humans can create a haphazardly smart jumble of wires by simulated evolution, or uploading small chunks of human brains and prodding them, or any number of other ways I didn't think of. In a certain sense these methods can be called "shallow". I see no reason why all such creatures would necessarily have an urge to stabilize their values.
