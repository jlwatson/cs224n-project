Indeed. As to why I find extreme consequences from general AI highly unlikely, [see here](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2011/01/singularity.html).   Alas, my main reason is partly buried in the comments (I really need to do a new post on this subject).  It can be summarized as follows: for basic reasons of economics and computer science, specialized algorithms are generally far superior to general ones. Specialized algorithms are what we should hope for or fear, and their positive and negative consequences occur a little at a time -- and have been occurring for a long time already, so we have many actual real-world observations to go by.  They can be addressed specifically, each passing tests 1-3, so that we can solve these problems and achieve these hopes one specialized task at a time, as well as induce general theories from these experiences (e.g. of security), without getting sucked into any of the near-infinity of Pascal scams one could dream up about the future of computing and robotics.
