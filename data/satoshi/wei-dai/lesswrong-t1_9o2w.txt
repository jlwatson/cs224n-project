Well, given what you seem to believe, you must either be more impressed with the alleged unsolvability of the problems than I am (implying that you think I would need more of a hero license than I think I would need to possess), or we agree about the problems being ultimately simple but you think it's unreasonable to try to solve some ultimately simple problems with the fate of the world at stake.  So it sounds like it's mostly the former fork; but possibly with a side order of you thinking that it's invalid for me to shrug and go 'Meh' at the fact that some other people taking completely different approaches failed to solve some ultimately simple problems, because the fact that they're all arguing with each other means I can't get into an epistemic state where I know I'm right, or something like that, whereas I don't particularly see them as being in my reference class one way or another - their ways of thinking, the way they talk, the way they approach the problem, etc., all seem completely unlike anything I do or would ever consider trying.

Let's say when I'd discovered Gary Drescher, he'd previously solved 'free will' the same way I had, but had spent decades using the same type of approaches I would intend to use on trying to produce a good nonperson predicate.  Then although it would be only N=1, and I do *kinda* intend to surpass Drescher, I would still be nervous on account of this *relevant* evidence.  The philosophers who can't agree on free will seem like entirely different sorts of creatures to me.
