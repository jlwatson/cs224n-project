&gt;When Anna tells me, "I'm worried that you don't seem very curious about this," there's this state of mind called 'curiosity' that we both agree is important - as a matter of rational process, on a meta-level above the particular issue at hand - and I know as a matter of process that when a respected fellow rationalist tells me that I need to become curious, I should pause and check my curiosity levels and try to increase them.

Having someone who would occasionally point out deficiencies in one's rational processes sounds awesome. Do you think it is possible for LWers to perform this service for each other on this forum, or does it require much closer interactions and/or intimate knowledge?

(It seems like the real meat of this post is in the second half, but a lot of people, including myself, got distracted by problems in the first half.)
