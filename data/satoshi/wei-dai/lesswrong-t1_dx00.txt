So what's the fix here?  If people think mailing lists work better than peer review, maybe an organization like OpenPhil should set up a mailing list for academics working on AI safety and award grants based on discussions on the mailing list?  Academia has a lot of momentum behind it, and it seems more efficient to redirect that momentum than try to set up something new from scratch.
