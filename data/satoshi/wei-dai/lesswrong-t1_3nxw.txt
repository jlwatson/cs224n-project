I endorse this but would modify this slightly: if you are someone who can use free time productively and who is unlikely to benefit from a community of intelligent and highly educated peers and mentors (for example, if your interests are narrow and not widely shared, or if you prefer to work on your own rather than consult others, or if you're so many sigmas out on the right side of the bell curve that other people just slow you down, etc.), then that's probably true.

If you're able to benefit from the community, it can be a pretty compelling factor though.
