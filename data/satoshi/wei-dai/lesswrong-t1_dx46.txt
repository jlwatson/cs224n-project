In some [recent](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1cn/why_i_think_the_foundational_research_institute/bha) [comments](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1cn/why_i_think_the_foundational_research_institute/bgz) over at the Effective Altruism Forum you talk about anti-realism about consciousness, saying in particular "the case for accepting anti-realism as the answer to the problem of consciousness seems pretty weak, at least as explained by Brian". I am wondering if you could elaborate more on this. Does the case for anti-realism about consciousness seem weak because of your [general uncertainty](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1cn/why_i_think_the_foundational_research_institute/bhp) on questions like this? Or is it more that you find the case for anti-realism specifically weak, and you hold some contrary position?

I am especially curious since I was under the impression that [many people on LessWrong hold essentially similar views](http://reducing-suffering.org/hard-problem-consciousness/#Examples_of_type-A_and_type-B_physicalists).
