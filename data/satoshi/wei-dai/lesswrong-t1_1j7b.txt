"rather there's a tendency to assume that complexity of value must lead to complexity of outcome"

The *main* problem I see here is the other way around: 

There's a tendency to assume that complexity of outcome *must* have been produced by complexity of value.

AFAICS, it is only members of this community that think this way.  Noboby else seems to have a problem with the idea of goals that can be concisely expressed - like: "trying to have as many offspring as possible" - leading to immense diversity and complexity.

This is a facet of an even more basic principle - that extremely simple rules can produce extremely complex outcomes - e.g. see the r-pentomino in the game of life.

You can see it clearly in the case of simple goals like "winning games of go".  The simple goal leads to an explosion of complexity - in the form of the resulting go-playing programs.
