I'm definitely interested in funding an existential risk organization. SIAI would have to be *a lot* more transparent than it is now right now for me to be interested in funding SIAI. For me personally, it wouldn't be enough for SIAI to *just* take measures to avoid poisoning the meme, I would need to see a lot more evidence that SIAI is systematically working to maximize its impact on existential risk reduction.

As things stand I prefer to hold out for a better organization. But if SIAI exhibited transparency and accountability of levels similar to those of GiveWell (welcoming and publically responding to criticism regularly, regularly posting detailed plans of action, seeking out feedback from subject matter specialists and making this public when possible, etc.) I would definitely fund SIAI and advocate that others do so as well.
