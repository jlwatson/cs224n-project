In b-money I had envisioned that a common type of contract would be one where all the participants, including a third-party arbitrator, deposit funds into an escrow account at the start, which can only be released at the end of the contract with the unanimous agreement of all the contracting parties. So the arbitrator would make judgments on performance and damages, and be incentivized to be fair in order to protect their reputation and not lose their own deposit, and the other parties would be incentivized to accept the arbitrator's judgments since that's the only way (short of direct account adjustment by everyone, aka forking) to get their escrow funds out. 

Not exactly the kind of "the code is the contract" smart contracts that some people are so excited about, and I have to say I don't quite understand the excitement. Without an AI that can live on the blockchain and replace human judgments, smart contracts are restricted to applications where such judgement are not required, and there doesn't seem to be many of these. Even when contracting for the production and delivery of digital goods, we still need human-like judgments when disputes arise regarding whether the goods delivered are the ones contracted for (except in rare cases where we can mathematically define what we want, like the prime factors of some integer).
