The interesting bit is that if you could actually use Solomonoff induction as prior, I'm pretty sure you'd be an irreparable aether believer and 'relativity sceptic', with confidence that has so many nines nothing would *ever* convince you. That's because the absolute-speed irreversible aether universes like 3d versions of Conway's game of life are so much more computationally compact than highly symmetric universe with many space-time symmetries (to the point of time and space intermixing in the equations) and the fully reversible fundamental laws of physics. Saying this to you as applied mathematician with experience actually implementing laws of physics in software.

The priors are only a free parameter if all you care for is not getting Dutch-booked on your bets about physics but do not give a damn to have any useful theories.
