Circular/anthropic arguments are seductive, but invariably turn out to be flawed because they predict less order and more narrowly-averted chaotic doom than we actually observe. Compared to our value system, which is genuinely a product of many evolutionary accidents, our concept of complexity is *too simple* because it can be captured (albeit imperfectly) by Turing machines. In other words, a creature using a randomly-evolved concept of "foobity" wouldn't be able to approach it with simple math, as we do.

I think i'ts a mistake to reach for the anthropic hammer whenever you see a confusing problem. The most extreme example was when Nesov produced a "proof" that particle physics is a Darwinian construct, after which (thankfully) the absurdity heuristic finally kicked in.
