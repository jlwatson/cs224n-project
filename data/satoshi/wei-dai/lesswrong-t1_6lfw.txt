Here's an attack on section 4.1. Consider the possibility that "philosophical ability" (something like the ability to solve confusing problems that can't be easily formalized) is needed to self-improve beyond some threshold of intelligence, and this same "philosophical ability" also reliably causes one to decide that some particular goal G is the right goal to have, and therefore beyond some threshold of intelligence all agents have goal G. To deny this possibility seems to require more meta-philosophical knowledge than we currently possess.
