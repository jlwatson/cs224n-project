Have you looked at some of the more recent papers in this literature (which generally have a lot more negative results than positive ones)? For example [Preference aggregation under uncertainty: Savage vs. Pareto](http://econ.ucsd.edu/~cpchambers/aggregate2.PDF)? I haven't paid too much attention to this literature myself yet, because the social aggregation results seem pretty sensitive to details of the assumed individual decision theory, which is still pretty unsettled. (Oh, I mentioned another paper [here](http://lesswrong.com/lw/12y/the_popularization_bias/zuc).)
