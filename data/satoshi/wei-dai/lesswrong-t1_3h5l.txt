So if an Idealized Aris (IA) knows the exact height of Everest, and the Base Aris doesn't, does that mean the only options are:

1. IA does not make use of the words "height" and "Everest".

2. IA makes use of the words and means the same thing as I do, so he can only know the height of Everest if I already know the height of Everest.

3. IA's referents for the words "height" and "Everest" are different from BA's. Therefore height and Everest doesn't mean what I think it means.

Somewhere your logic has holes in it.
