The thought experiments proposed in the post and the comments hint at at a strictly simpler problem that we need to solve before tackling consciousness anyway: what is "algorithmicness"? What constitutes a "causal implementation" of an algorithm and distinguishes it from a video feed replay? How can we remove the need for vague "bridging laws" between algorithmicness and physical reality?
