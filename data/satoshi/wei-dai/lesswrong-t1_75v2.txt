Robin talks about a class system where those running at higher speeds are in a higher social class. But given Robin's assumption that cost for emulation speed will be linear up to 1000000x, I don't see why anyone (except those with physical work, which Robin estimates at 20% of the population) wouldn't want to run at the top end of this range. In his scenario of a boss running at 21x the speed of the workers, why isn't the whole team being run at the higher speed? Does anyone understand his reasoning here?
