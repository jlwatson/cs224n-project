&gt;wedrifid, who is somehow capable of pleasant interaction while being a complete jerk

Regardless of whether or not this is compatible with being a "complete jerk" in your sense, I wish to point out that wedrifid is in many respects an *exemplary* Less Wrong commenter. There are few others I can think of who are simultaneously as (1)  *informative*, including about their own brain state, (2) *rational*, especially in the sense of being willing and able to disagree within factions/alliances and agree across them, and (3) *socially clueful*, in the sense of being aware of the unspoken interpersonal implications of all discourse and putting in the necessary work to manage these implications in a way compatible with one's other goals (naturally the methods used are community-specific but that is more than good enough).

In saying this, I don't know whether I'm expanding on your point or disagreeing with it.
