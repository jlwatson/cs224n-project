I find calling "allowing your other values to be edited by others" a value is a bit forced - it's a feature of human brains, but if I were to model my mind as an agent with values, I'm not sure I'd list that among the values.

Also, there are cases where everybody here (probably) agrees we don't want our values to be changed by others (advertisers trying to get us to value the awesome image of driving a Mercedes Benz!), and cases where most people here would agree we want our values to be flexible and may adopt new ones (say, when thinking about how to deal with completely new and weird cases that aren't covered by our pre-existing values or by Christian tradition, like brain uploads or duplication machines or encountering weird aliens). I think most of the discussion is where exactly to draw the line.
