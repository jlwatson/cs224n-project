&gt; What makes me trust Pei Wang more than Luke is the common-sense statements like "to make AGI safe, to control their experience will probably be the main approach (which is what “education” is all about), but even that cannot guarantee safety." and "unless you get a right idea about what AGI is and how it can be built, it is very unlikely for you to know how to make it safe". 

Um... but these are statements I *agreed* with.

I wish Pei had taken the time to read the articles I repeatedly linked to, for they were written precisely to explain why his position is misguided.
