&gt;For example, see this subthread where multiple users discuss how spectator sports are "banal" and "pointless". 

Although I didn't write those comments, I think from the context of that subthread, it was intended that spectator sports are  "banal" and "pointless" compared to philosophy or existential risk reduction, not arguing over whether Star Wars or Star Trek is superior. 

(BTW, I personally think it (arguing over ...) is just as banal and pointless as spectator sports. On the other hand, watching Star Wars or Star Trek is not pointless, since it lets you learn the possibility of things like AI and space travel, which you might not otherwise be aware of. I wrote a [post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1lw/fictional_evidence_vs_fictional_insight/) about this.)
