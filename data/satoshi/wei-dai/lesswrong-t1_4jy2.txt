I mean it depends a lot on what we mean by "smart people". I'm thinking of theists like a bright philosophy student on the dumber end of smart, C. S. Lewis in the middle, and geniuses like Leibniz on the smarter end. People whose ideas might actually be worth engaging with. E.g. if your friend or someone at a party is a bright philosophy student, it might be worth engaging with them, or if you have some free time it might be a good idea to check out the ideas of some smart Christians like C. S. Lewis, and everyone in the world should take the time to check out the genius of Leibniz considering he was a theist and also the father of computer science. Their ideas are often decently sophisticated, not just something that can be described and discarded as "ontologically fundamental mental states", and it's worth translating their ideas into a decent language where you can understand them a little better. And if it happens to give you okay ideas while doing so, all the better, but that's not really the point.
