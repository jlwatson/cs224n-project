Ben Goertzel's projects are knowably hopeless, so I didn't too strongly oppose Tyler Emerson's project from within SIAI's then-Board of Directors; it was being argued to have political benefits, and I saw no noticeable x-risk so I didn't expend my own political capital to veto it, just sighed.  Nowadays the Board would not vote for this.

And it is also true that, in the hypothetical counterfactual conditional where Goertzel's creations work, we all die.  I'd phrase the email message differently today to avoid any appearance of endorsing the probability, because today I understand better that most people have trouble mentally separating hypotheticals.  But the hypothetical is still true in that counterfactual universe, if not in this one.

There is no contradiction here.
