&gt; I think the natural way to classify that is to look at when the pure machine intelligences exceed the augmented humans.

So: by far the most important human augmentation in the future is going to involve preprocessing sensory inputs using machines, post-processing motor outputs by machines, and doing processing that bypasses the human brain entirely.  Not drugs, or eduction, or anything else.

In such scenarios, the machines won't ever really "overtake" the augmented humans, they will just catch up with them.  So, for instance, a human with a robot army is not functionally very much different from a robot army.  Eventually the human becomes unnecessary and becomes a small burden, but that hardly seems very significant.  So: the point that you are talking about seems to be far future, difficult to measure, and seems to me to be inappropriate as the basis of a classification scheme.
