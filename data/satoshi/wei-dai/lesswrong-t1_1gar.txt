&gt; But evidence of the "just believe me I'm special" variety won't.

Oh come on, no-one is arguing that this should convince you.  Obviously the outside view is the correct position in the absence of inside view evidence, no-one disputes that. The dispute is this: some people seem to believe that any effort to look into the details of the claim rather than taking the outside view is simply a self-serving effort to avoid the conclusions the outside view brings you to. Taken to extremes this leads to the position I'm mocking. If you agree that inside view evidence is worth examining, then we're on the same side in this discussion.
