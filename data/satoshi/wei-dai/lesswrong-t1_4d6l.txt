&gt; you ought to end up spending roughly half of your time/resources on what U1 says you should do, and half on what U2 says you should do

That can't be right. What if U1 says you ought to buy an Xbox, then U2 says you ought to throw it away? Looks like a waste of resources. To avoid such wastes, your behavior must be Bayesian-rational. That means it must be governed by a utility function U3. What U3 is defined by the parliamentary model? You say it's not averaging, but it has to be *some* function defined in terms of U1 and U2.

We've discussed a similar problem proposed by Stuart on the mailing list and I believe I gave a good argument (on Jan 21, 2011) that U3 must be some linear combination of U1 and U2 if you want to have nice things like Pareto-optimality. All bargaining should be collapsed into the initial moment, and output the coefficients of the linear combination which never change from that point on.
