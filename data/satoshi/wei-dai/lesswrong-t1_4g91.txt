&gt;What would you say to someone who does not share your intuition that such "objective" morality likely exists?

I'd say: be an error theorist!  If you don't think objective morality exists, then you don't think that *morality* exists.  That's a perfectly respectable position.  You can still agree with me about *what it would take* for morality to really exist.  You just don't think that our world actually has what it takes.
