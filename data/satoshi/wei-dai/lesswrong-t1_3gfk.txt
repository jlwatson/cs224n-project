I'm not sure. 

Projecting that answer onto my question I get something like "Because ethical systems in which "right" has an actual referent are better, for unspecified reasons, than ones in which it doesn't, and Wei Dai's current unextrapolated preferences involve an actual though unspecified referent for "right," so we can at the very least reject all systems where  "right" doesn't designate anything actual in favor of the system Wei Dai's current unextrapolated preferences implement, even if nothing better ever comes along."

Is that close enough to your answer?
