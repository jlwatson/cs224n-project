Intelligence amplification and artificial intelligence are listed as separate scenarios.

Today, we have *both* machine-amplified human intelligence and machine intelligence - and that situation is likely to persist until we have intelligent machines that are roughly as smart as humans.  Intelligence augmentation and machine intelligence are complementary - and are not in competition - as I explain [here](http://www.alife.co.uk/essays/intelligence_augmentation/). Both processes are significant, it seems.  Machines are built to compensate for our weaknesses.  Such scenarios are the ones we are going to get - and they do not seem to fit into the categorisation scheme very well.
