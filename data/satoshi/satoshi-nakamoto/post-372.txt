Thanks for finding that. We switched from ANSI in 0.2 to UTF-8 in version 0.3,
so it must be related to that.  
  
Just to confirm, if you log in with the non-latin character username, not
having an appdata/Bitcoin directory yet, and run Bitcoin and let it create the
database from scratch, does it work or not?
