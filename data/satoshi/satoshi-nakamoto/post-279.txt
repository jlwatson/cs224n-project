Please test 0.3.2.5 in preparation for the 0.3.3 release! This build is
looking good and should be the one that goes into 0.3.3. I encourage you to go
ahead and upgrade now if you're on Windows or Linux.  
  
New features:  
\- Gavin Andresen's HTTP authentication to secure JSON-RPC  
\- 5x faster initial block download, under 30 minutes
