This is now fixed in the SVN version.  
1) Menu bar default color.  
2) Balance bar not a different color.  
3) Background behind bitcoin address and balance now the same color as
toolbar.  
  
I checked all the standard themes and it seems reasonable with all of them.  
  
Ubuntu minimize,maximize,close buttons to the right:  
gconf-editor  
apps->metacity->general  
button_layout=menu:minimize,maximize,close  
  
They've got it awfully buried considering 9 out of 10 users are used to having
it on the right.
