It is also throwing the same std::string issue on the latest version of Ubuntu
Linux.  

Then it must be something you're doing differently with building or
configuring wxWidgets.  
  
What options did you use on the wxWidgets "configure" script? The options I
used are in build-unix.txt.  
  

One question: how do I enable the debug.log? I have tried stopping bitcoin and
touching ~/.bitcoin/debug.log and starting bitcoin again. It never seems to
write to the file. Am I missing something?  

Never heard of that happening. Is there anything in debug.log? If you touched
the file, that sounds like something is there. Does the program have write
access to the file?
