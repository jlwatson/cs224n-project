Then it must be something you're doing differently with building or
configuring wxWidgets.  
  
What options did you use on the wxWidgets "configure" script? The options I
used are in build-unix.txt.  
  
Never heard of that happening. Is there anything in debug.log? If you touched
the file, that sounds like something is there. Does the program have write
access to the file?
