That big of a difference in speed, by a factor of 4 or 6, feels like it's
likely to be some quirky weak spot or instruction that the old chip is slow
with. Unless it's a touted feature of the i5 that they made SSE2 six times
faster.  
  
A quick summary:  
Xeon Quad 41% slower  
Core 2 Duo 55% slower  
Core 2 Duo same (vess)  
Core 2 Quad 50% slower  
Core i5 200% faster (nelisky)  
Core i5 100% faster (vess)  
AMD Opteron 105% faster  
  
aceat64:  
My system went from ~7100 to ~4200.  
This particular system has dual Intel Xeon Quad-Core CPUs (E5335) @ 2.00GHz.  
  
impossible7:  
on an Intel Core 2 Duo T7300 running x86_64 linux it was 55% slower compared
to the stock version (r121)  
  
nelisky:  
My Core2Quad (Q6600) slowed down 50%,  
my i5 improved ~200%,  
  
impossible7:  
on an AMD Opteron 2374 HE running x86_64 linux I got a 105% improvement (!)
