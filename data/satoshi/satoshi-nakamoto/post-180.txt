0.3.10 has tcatm's 4-way SSE2 as an option switch.  
  
Use the switch "-4way" to turn it on. Without the switch you get Crypto++ ASM
SHA-256.  
  
I could only get this working with Linux.

Please report back your CPU and results! I think it's pretty clear that Core 2
and lower are slower, i5 faster. I don't think we've heard any i7 results yet.
We need to know about the different models of AMD or other less common CPUs.
