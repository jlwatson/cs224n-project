We don't really need pre-compiled header. It only makes it compile slightly
faster. I think I'll just get rid of it. Even still, you'd still need to
remember to "make -f makefile.unix clean" or delete headers.h.gch one more
time to get rid of the leftover file.  
  
Damn that GLIBC_2.11. I thought I'd been careful not to accept any of the
updates.
