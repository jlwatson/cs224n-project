Silently failing would look bad.  
  

Definitely needed. What rate are you thinking of? Ultimately, it's better to
rate limit it than to let it all drain out.  
  
That might work surprisingly well. If it works, it keeps them from hitting the
rate limit, but the rate limit is there as the last line of defence.  
  
Definitely time to lower it.
