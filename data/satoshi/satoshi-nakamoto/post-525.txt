That's true, with the send-to-IP option, you are sending to whoever answers
that IP. Sending to a bitcoin address doesn't have that problem.  
  
The plan is to implement an IP + bitcoin address option that would have the
benefits of both. It would still use a different address for each transaction,
but the receiver would sign the one-time-use address with the given bitcoin
address to prove it belongs to the intended receiver.
