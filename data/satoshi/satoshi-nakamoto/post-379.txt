OK, back to 0.3 then.  
  
Please download RC4 and check it over as soon as possible. I'd like to release
it soon.

Other than the version number change, which included changes in readme.txt and
setup.nsi, I reduced the maximum number of outbound connections from 15 to 8
so nodes that accept inbound don't get too many connections. 15 was a lot more
than needed. 8 is still plenty for redundancy.
