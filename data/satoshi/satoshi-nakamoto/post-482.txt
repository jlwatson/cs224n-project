2 seconds of latency in both directions should reduce your generation success
by less than 1%.  
  
Probably OK, but I'm not sure. The protocol is designed to resync to the next
message, and messages get re-requested from all the other nodes you're
connected to until received. If you miss a block, it'll also keep requesting
it every time another blocks comes in and it sees there's a gap. Before the
original release I did a test dropping 1 out of 4 random messages under heavy
load until I could run it overnight without any nodes getting stuck.
