ShadowOfHarbringer, is yours faster with -4way?  
  
If it is, then I'm thinking that any AMD that supports 64-bit has 128-bit
SSE2.  
  
The specialbuild version I posted here looks for model 4 or higher. If yours
is faster with -4way, then I should change it to always use SSE2 with any AMD
with 64-bit.
