Trying it without the DB_PRIVATE flag in rev 153.  We need to keep an eye on
what's different.  
  
On Windows at least, it creates six __db.001 - __db.006 files with sizes from
24K to 4MB.  It doesn't delete them on exit, it just leaves them behind.  
  
The docs say it uses memory mapped files.  I assume they have the same file
permissions as the database files, so the same user access restrictions apply.  
  
Tests on Windows private LAN download of 78500 blocks:  
with DB_PRIVATE  20 minutes 51 seconds  
without DB_PRIVATE  20 minutes 51 seconds  
  
I wasn't expecting them to come out exactly the same.
