It can be phased in, like:  
  
if (blocknumber > 115000)  
maxblocksize = largerlimit  
  
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block
number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already
obsolete.  
  
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to
make sure they know they have to upgrade.
