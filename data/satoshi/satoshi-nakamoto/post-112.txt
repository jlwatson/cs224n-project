The "About" dialog still shows 0.3.10.1 beta.  

What OS? I ran the Windows and 64-bit Linux version and checked the about
dialog.  
  
The Mac version is still 0.3.10.1.  
  

iirc, it is possible to specify -march on a per-function basis using some gcc
__attribute__. That way, only the function in question would be optimized, and
if the user doesn't specify -4way, everything else should be ok.  

I updated the first post to be more specific. Only the -4way code is compiled
this way.
