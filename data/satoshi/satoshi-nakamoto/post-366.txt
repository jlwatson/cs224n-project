However, if something happened and the signatures were compromised (perhaps
integer factorization is solved, quantum computers?), then even agreeing upon
the last valid block would be worthless.  

True, if it happened suddenly. If it happens gradually, we can still
transition to something stronger. When you run the upgraded software for the
first time, it would re-sign all your money with the new stronger signature
algorithm. (by creating a transaction sending the money to yourself with the
stronger sig)
