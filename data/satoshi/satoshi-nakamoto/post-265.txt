I replaced the last of the few wxBase dependencies in bitcoind.  
  
bitcoind now compiles without wxWidgets or wxBase in SVN rev 112.  
  
main(int argc, char* argv[]) is added to init.cpp. CMyApp and the Startup
folder stuff are moved to ui.cpp. ui.cpp and uibase.cpp aren't linked by
bitcoind.  
  
The makefiles have -DGUI to control whether the GUI is used.  
  
I test compiled MinGW, VC and Ubuntu. I don't know if I broke the Mac OSX
build, someone will need to check that.
