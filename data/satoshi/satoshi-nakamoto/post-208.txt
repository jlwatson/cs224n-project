That's a good point, I believe you could run with generation off if you don't
have SSE2.  
  
How about add to the top of cryptopp/config.h:  
  
#if !defined(_M_X64) && !defined(__x86_64__)  
#define CRYPTOPP_DISABLE_SSE2 1  
#endif  
  
that would disable SSE2 for 32-bit builds. (at least with GCC or MSVC)
