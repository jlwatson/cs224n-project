He was generating invalid blocks at difficulty 1.0. He must have a corrupted
entry in his blk0001.dat or blkindex.dat file. He just needs to delete
blk*.dat and let it redownload.  
  
The safety lockdown detected the problem and was displaying "WARNING:
Displayed transactions may not be correct!" because it saw a longer chain
existed that it was unable to accept. The safety lockdown cannot stop
generation or it would create an attack possibility.  
  
Good idea, I made a change to make sure it won't generate before checkpoint
block 74000.
