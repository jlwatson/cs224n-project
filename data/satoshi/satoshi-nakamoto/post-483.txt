I thought about that but there wasn't a practical way to do smaller
increments. The frequency of block generation is balanced between confirming
transactions as fast as possible and the latency of the network.  
  
The algorithm aims for an average of 6 blocks per hour. If it was 5 bc and 60
per hour, there would be 10 times as many blocks and the initial block
download would take 10 times as long. It wouldn't work anyway because that
would be only 1 minute average between blocks, too close to the broadcast
latency when the network gets larger.
