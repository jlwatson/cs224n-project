The transfer is immediate if you send by IP address. If you send by bitcoin
address and the recipient isn't online at the time, it might take 30 minutes
or more to see it.  
  
Also, the recipient needs to be synced up with the block chain before it'll
see the received transaction. That means the status bar at the bottom needs to
say at least 33000 blocks, like "x connections 33200 blocks x transactions".  
  

  
Would it be clearer if the status said "x confirmations", like:  
2/unconfirmed  
3/unconfirmed  
4/unconfirmed  
5/unconfirmed  
6 confirmations  
7 confirmations  
8 confirmations  
  
Each block essentially means another node has confirmed that it agrees with
all transactions up to that point.
