ArtForz is already running with no fees, and he has 20-30% of the network's
CPU power. The person who originally sent the broken transactions deleted his
wallet, though, and the network has forgotten these historical transactions,
so any transactions based on this won't confirm.  

Transactions aren't accepted or displayed as 0/unconfirmed until your node has
a path of transactions back to the block chain.  
  
Any transactions in your wallet also have bundled with them all unrecorded
transactions required to reach the block chain. If you have a transaction that
is displayed as 0/unconfirmed, then you have all the previous unrecorded
transactions it depends on and you will also rebroadcast those transactions
when you rebroadcast yours.  
  
If a no-fee block has already been generated and hasn't helped, then I need to
look at what's wrong. It's a part of code that doesn't get much use. They
should be recorded in the wallets of everyone who has a transaction depending
on them.  
  

The person who originally sent the broken transactions deleted his wallet  

Sigh... why delete a wallet instead of moving it aside and keeping the old
copy just in case? You should never delete a wallet.  
  

It's running. Should find a block within 3 hours.  

It may take a while to collect re-broadcast transactions. It'll help if you
can accept inbound connections so you'll be listening to more nodes. Even if
you find a block in 3 hours, keep it running continuously for a few days at
least.
