I think that you should add something about this:
http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=259.0  
There must be a label on the client that show a warning message if needed  
Now everyone have always to check the website, and I think that this is bad.  

Agree, wanted to do that for a long time, haven't had time to do it.  
  
For now, you could also subscribe to the bitcoin-list mailing list. It rarely
gets used except for announcements like this and major new versions.
