Many big ISPs give you a new IP every time you connect, usually in the same
class B (a.b.?.?).  Maybe you should have a minimum time between payments per
class-B.  
  
If you can't solve the problem, you can always keep lowering the amount of
bitcoins given until it's manageable, and always require captcha.
