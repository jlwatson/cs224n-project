I just did a quick survey of 20 .conf files in /etc on my debian system, and
found:  
1 file used "key value"  
5 used "key=value"  

Thanks for that survey!  
  
I find "key value" a little unnatural. There ought to be a more definite
separator between key and value that suggests assignment. The space people may
just be getting lazy using their language's split function.  
key=some full sentence with spaces in it. # seems more clear  
key some full sentence with spaces in it. # than this  
  
Allright then, lets go with self-parsed mapConfig, syntax:  
# comment  
key=value  
  
file extension .conf. What's the filename, is it ~/.bitcoin/settings.conf or
~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf or what?  
  
I think we better strip whitespace at the beginning and end of the key and the
value.  
# user who likes column formatted  
k = value  
key = value  
longerkey = this sentence would be this # "this sentence would be this"  
key = value # guess this is ok too  
nextkey = value  
right = justified  
  
The normal syntax should be "key=value", but you can't blame people for the
occasional "key = value".
