You should use at least some priority in case a flood comes along before the
next block.  
  
As long as all dependencies have at least 1 conf, if the transaction doesn't
have enough priority at first, the dependencies will age until it does.  
  
Or managing how much priority you spend on a transaction. The software would
have to know your future plans to know whether to spend your priority now or
save it for later. I don't think we'll need to get into that much detail
though. There's a wide enough difference between normal users and flooders.  
  
Priority doesn't have to do everything. Once you know there's a flood, you can
add -paytxfee=0.01. Hopefully with priority, your transactions before that
should be at worst slow, not stuck.
