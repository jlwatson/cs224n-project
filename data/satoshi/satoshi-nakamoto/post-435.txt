This is on my list. I will soon make the "Your Bitcoin Address:" window
automatically change whenever you receive anything to the address displayed.  
  
I'm also recommending this approach for the implementation of web apps. I just
posted some sample code showing a suggested way of implementing this.  
  
Versions on SVN since 0.2.4 already have a "New..." button next to the address
bar to encourage changing it manually too.  
  
@theymos: If nothing else, we can fall back on that solution in the future.
