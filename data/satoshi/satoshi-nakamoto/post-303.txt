That's what I thought too.  
  
Now I'm hearing a report that it IS possible for javascript to do a cross-
domain POST request to 127.0.0.1. Not other domains, but just specifically to
that one. Great...  
  
If this is the case, then do not use the -server switch or bitcoind on a
system where you do web browsing.  
  
I'll get started on adding the password field.
