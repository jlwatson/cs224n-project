When I run bitcoin it becomes very sluggish, almost unusable. When I stop
bitcoin everything goes ok again. Its running Ubuntu desktop 10.04 amd64 using
ia32libs and the binary in bitcoin 0.20 tarball.  

0.3.1 fixes that, sets the generate threads to the lowest priority. Download
links are on the homepage now.
