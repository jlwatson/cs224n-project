If you haven't already, try aligning thash.  It might matter.  Couldn't hurt.

Looks like we're triggering a compiler bug in the tree optimizer. Can you try
to compile it -O0?  

No help from -O0, same error.  
  
MinGW is GCC 3.4.5. Probably the problem.  
  
I'll see if I can get a newer version of MinGW.
