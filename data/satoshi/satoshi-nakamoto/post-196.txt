Are you back to talking about the existing Bitcoin system here?  
  
I was talking about in the hypothetical system I was describing, if the
network doesn't know the values and lineage of the transactions, then it can't
verify them and vouch for them, so the clients would have to keep the history
all the way back.  
  
If a client wasn't present until recently, the two ways to convince it that a
transaction has a valid past is:  
1) Show it the entire history back to the original generated coin.  
2) Show it a history back to a thoroughly deep block, then trust that if so
many nodes all said the history up to then was correct then it must be true.  
  
But if the network didn't know all the values and lineage of the transactions,
it couldn't do 2), I don't think.
