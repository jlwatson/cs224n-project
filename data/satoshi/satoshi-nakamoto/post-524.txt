Right, the SVN has the almost-release-candidate 0.2 source, which can also be
built and run on Linux. It hasn't been tested on FreeBSD.  
  

That would be a big help. TOR users wouldn't have to worry about how to get
seeded, and we wouldn't depend on IRC.  
  
It can be run in a few simple modes without access to the UI if you don't mind
a minimized window on the desktop. (0.1.5 doesn't have -min so it would be an
open window)  
  
To only run a seed:  
bitcoin -min -gen=0  
  
You could sort of monitor it by looking at debug.log. To stop it, kill the
process, the database won't mind.  
  
To generate:  
bitcoin -min -gen  
  
To get the generated bitcoins, you'd have to copy wallet.dat (with version
0.2) to a machine with a UI, swap in the wallet.dat, run bitcoin and transfer
the coins to your main account. (With version 0.1.5 you'd have to copy the
whole "%appdata%/Bitcoin" directory.) There is one caveat about copying
wallet.dat: if you happened to kill the program at the exact moment that it
generated a coin or received a payment, wallet.dat might not work by itself
and you'd have to copy the whole directory.  
  
I see, that would happen with multiple nodes using the same NAT or VPN or some
ISP that funnels everyone through a few proxy servers. I just committed a fix
to SVN for this. If it gets "433" name already in use (it was error 433,
right?), it'll retry with a non-address random username.  
  
That's great, any help is really appreciated!
