There is this piece of code in headers.h:  
`  
#ifdef __WXMAC_OSX__  
#define __WXMAC__ 1  
#define __WXOSX__ 1  
#define __BSD__ 1  
#endif  
#endif  
`  

That code was a bad idea anyway, I'm deleting it. Any Mac code should only use
__WXMAC_OSX__, not __WXMAC__ or __WXOSX__, and we should stop using __BSD__.  
  

`  
#if (defined(__unix__) || defined(unix)) && !defined(USG)  
#include <sys/param.h>  
#endif  
`  

Will that definitely cause BSD to be defined on Mac?
