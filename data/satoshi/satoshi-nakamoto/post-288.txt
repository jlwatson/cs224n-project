Question for everybody: should I add a section to the wiki page describing, in
detail, how to do HTTP Basic authentication? PHP and Python make is really
easy-- just use the http://user:pass@host:port/ URL syntax.  

Yes, I think that would be really good so each dev doesn't have to figure it
out themselves. We need a simple example for each of Python, PHP and Java
importing the json-rpc library and using it to do a getinfo or something,
including doing the http authentication part.
