New transaction templates can be added as needed. Within a few days, there
will be plenty of GPU power that accepts and works on it. Network support will
be thorough _long before_ there'll be enough clients who understand how to
receive and interpret the new transaction.  
  
Timestamp hashes are still already possible:  
  
txin: 0.01  
txout: 0.00 <appid, hash> OP_CHECKSIG  
fee: 0.01  
  
If there's an actual application like BitDNS getting ready to actually start
inserting hashes, we can always add a specific transaction template for
timestamps.  
  
I like Hal Finney's idea for user-friendly timestamping. Convert the hash of a
file to a bitcoin address and send 0.01 to it:
