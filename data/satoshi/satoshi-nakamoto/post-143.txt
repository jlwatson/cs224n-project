wxWidgets 2.9 is their first UTF-8 version. We are UTF-8 on all platforms
including Windows.  
  
The distro packages of 2.8 are UTF-16, so they just trip people up. People had
endless build problems with 2.8 and its wxString UTF-16/ANSI conditional build
options until we standardized on 2.9. Also, to use 2.8, we were using ANSI,
which was just a temporary stopgap until wxWidgets supported UTF-8.  
  
This is a problem that will solve itself. With time, 2.9 will become a more
mainline release.
