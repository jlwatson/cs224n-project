creighto: I agree with that idea. After a few hours, it should be possible for
the client to notice if the flow of blocks has dropped off by more than would
be likely just by chance. It could tell if it's not hearing the hum of the
world anymore.  
  

In practice, splits are likely to be very asymmetrical. It would be hard to
split the world down the middle. More likely it would be a single country vs
the rest of the world, lets say a 1:10 split. In that case, it would take the
minority fork 10 times as long to generate 100 blocks, so about 7 days. Also
it would be super easy for the client to realize it's hearing way too few
blocks and something must be wrong.  
  
There's no time limit. Assuming you weren't spending coins generated in the
minority fork, or spending someone's double-spends you received, your
transactions can get into the other chain at any time later.
