Fault Module Name: mingwm10.dll  

This is the important clue.  I believe it's saying it crashed in that.  Maybe
there are other versions of it to try. mingwm10.dll is just a simple
placeholder thing that satisfies some callback requirement for multithreaded
apps.  
  
Is anyone else running OK on Windows 64-bit?
