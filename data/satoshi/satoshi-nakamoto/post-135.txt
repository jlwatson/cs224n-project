Thanks for clearing that up. I read the link someone posted about AMD making
that change around 2007, but I didn't know what the story was for Intel.  
  
There's no hope for Core/Core2 then. They only have half the SSE2 hardware.  
  
Strange that Intel has 3 128bit units, but AMD with 2 128bit units is the
faster one.
