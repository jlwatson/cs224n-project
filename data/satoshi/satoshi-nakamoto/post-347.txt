I need to give an updated .po file.  
  
OK, this must be a problem somewhere, I'll have to take a look at it or one of
the other devs can.  
  
Many of the strings are in code automatically generated from uiproject.fbp
where nothing can be done about these things. I have a program I use to find
all the spacing inconsistencies at the beginning and ending of strings in your
.po file and manually fix them up before I upload them to SVN.
