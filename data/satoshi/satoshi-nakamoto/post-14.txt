I came to agree with Gavin about whitelisting when I realized how quickly new
transaction types can be added.  
  

That's already possible. <pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG. <pubkey> can be 33 to 120
bytes.  
  
I also support a third transaction type for timestamp hash sized arbitrary
data. There's no point not having one since you can already do it anyway. It
would tell nodes they don't need to bother to index it.
