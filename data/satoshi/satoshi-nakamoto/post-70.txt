Forgot to say, I suspected the detect might not work on 64-bit AMD. I found it
hard to believe but AMD reports a different model number in 64-bit mode.  
  
Could you grep CPUID your debug.log and tell me what it says? (and anyone else
with 64-bit AMD) And what AMD chip do you have?  
  
Do all AMDs that support 64-bit have the better SSE2 hardware also?
