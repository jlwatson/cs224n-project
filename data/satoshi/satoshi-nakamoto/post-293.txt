Still need to know what's the most typical settings file format on Linux. Is
there a standard file extension? I've never seen a settings file using JSON,
and it doesn't look very human friendly with everything required to be in
quotes. I think what I usually see is like:  
# comment  
setting=value  
  
Is there a settings file thing in Boost?  
  
When you're using bitcoind to issue commands from the command line as a
client, can we have it get the password from the settings file then too?  
  
Gavin pointed out I forgot to increment the column of numbers in
CommandLineRPC, so the current -rpcpw= implementation doesn't work right from
the command line with non-string parameters. (JSON-RPC is fine) Still under
construction.
