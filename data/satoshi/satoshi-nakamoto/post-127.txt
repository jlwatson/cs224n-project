WRT the alert system, who cares? The most the key can do is temporarily
disable six json-rpc commands until the site owners either add the
-disablesafemode switch or upgrade. All nodes keep running and generating, the
network stays up. If I'm not available, any script kiddie can figure out how
to add two characters and make a new version that disables the alert system.
It would be a temporary inconvenience only.  
  
This is what makes me think the people objecting don't know what they're
talking about. It can't "shut down the complete network".
