Repeating myself here, but there is open source software for that, so it would
just be a matter of bolting on a Bitcoin payment mechanism. One good one I
found was Mihalism Multi Host. It's designed as a free host, so it would just
need a few tweaks to loosen up restrictions consistent with paid use.
