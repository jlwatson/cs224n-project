Did you try -4way?  
  
AMD Phenom (I think 4-core) CPUs are doing about 11,000khps with -4way, about
100% speedup. 24 cores should get 66,000khps. AMD is the best choice because
it has the best SSE2 implementation. (or maybe because tcatm had an AMD and
optimised his code for that)  
  
There's been so much else to do that I haven't had time to make -4way
automatic. For now you still have to do it manually.
