At the moment, it always assumes the incoming port is 8333, so it would tell
other bitcoin nodes to connect to router:8333 even if you're redirecting from
another port number.  
  
I'm not in a big hurry to fix this because I can't think of any benefit to
having more than one incoming connection port. If you're providing one
incoming port, then you've done your bit to help the network. Having two
incoming ports to the same person doesn't help redundancy.  
  
If you have many computers, then using the -connect switch on most of them to
connect locally makes more sense.
