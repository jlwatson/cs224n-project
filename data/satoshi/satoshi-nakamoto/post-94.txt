 ~~Also, does Bitcoin open the BerkeleyDB as exclusive, precluding the need
for a file lock?~~ It does not -- did my own tests.  

Is there a way to open BerkeleyDB exclusive?  
  
DB_PRIVATE is the worst of both worlds. DB_PRIVATE is not exclusive, but it
does make it get screwed up if another process tries to access it at the same
time.  
  
I've dropped the DB_PRIVATE flag in rev 153.
