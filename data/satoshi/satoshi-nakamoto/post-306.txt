Version 0.3 was supposed to reduce the number of outgoing connections on non-
port forwarded clients from 15 to 8, but I don't think it really happened. I'm
not positive if this is the case. Correct me if I'm wrong.  

In 0.3.0, the change to 8 only ended up in the Windows version, the other
versions still had 15.  
  
Please upgrade to 0.3.2, it's available now.
