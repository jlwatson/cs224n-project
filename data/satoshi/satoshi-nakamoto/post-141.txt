That's the first I've heard anyone say i5 was slower. Everyone else has said
4way was faster on i5. Moreso with hyperthreading enabled.  
  
Good, so I take it that's a confirmation that it's working on Mac as well?  
  
Laszlo told me he did compile in the -4way stuff on Mac, so the -4way switch
is also available to try on Mac. I don't think makefile.osx on SVN has it yet,
just the built version.
