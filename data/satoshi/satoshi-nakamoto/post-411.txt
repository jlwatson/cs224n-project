I integrated the hashmeter idea into the SVN version. It displays khash/s in
the left section of the status bar.  
  
Two new log messages:  
21/06/2010 01:23 hashmeter 2 CPUs 799 khash/s  
21/06/2010 01:23 generated 50.00  
  
grep your debug.log for "generated" to see what you've generated, and grep for
"hashmeter" to see the performance. On windows, use:  
findstr "hashmeter generated" "%appdata%\bitcoin\debug.log"  
  
I have the hashmeter messages once an hour. How often do you think it should
be?
