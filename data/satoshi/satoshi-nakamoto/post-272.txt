You would still have to sign it with public key 654321. You need to find a
collision using a public key for which you know the private key.  
  
When you claim a Bitcoin Address transaction, you give your public key that
matches the hash, then you must sign it with that key.  
  
Red's point is that it's easy to quickly generate insecure public keys which
you could break and find the private key after you find a collision.  
  
He points out that if the public key was required to be a secure one, one
which must have required significant work to find the prime numbers, that
would increase the strength above that of the hash function alone. Someone
trying to brute force would have to take time generating a key for each
attempt.
