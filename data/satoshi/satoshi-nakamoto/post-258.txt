Was that the only thing I broke in the OSX build?! Does it actually work after
just that one change?  
  
I had to do that for makefile.vc also. It compiled, but SHA-256 didn't work
correctly; it returned the same incorrect hash each time.  
  
We'll disable it now, and if anyone figures out how to fix it, we can re-
enable it then. It's still 1.7x faster from the midstate optimisation.  
  
The Crypto++ ASM SHA-256 works with GCC on Linux and Windows (MinGW).  
  
I uploaded this makefile.osx change to SVN. (let me know if that compiles now)
