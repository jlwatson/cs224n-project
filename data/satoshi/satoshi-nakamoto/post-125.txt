So, theoretical this is a first control system where <some goverment> can
arrest satoshi and demand  
that he hands over his key (or get it from his computer) and shut down the
complete network?  
  
Or is that not possible? How far would <some goverment> get?  

This is what makes me think the people objecting don't know what they're
talking about. It can't "shut down the complete network".  

I've never objected this change/idea, just asking if this was possible and to
what extent.  
What's wrong with getting informed?  

My apologies, your post was indeed a question not a statement.
