MinGW GCC 4.5.0:  
Crypto++ doesn't work, X86_SHA256_HashBlocks() never returns  
I only got 4-way working with test.cpp but not when called by BitcoinMiner  
  
MinGW GCC 4.4.1:  
Crypto++ works  
4-way SIGSEGV  
  
GCC is definitely not aligning __m128i.  
  
Even if we align our own __m128i variables, the compiler may decide to use a
__m128i behind the scenes as a temporary variable.  
  
By making our __m128i variables aligned and changing these inlines to defines,
I was able to get it to work on 4.4.1 with -O0 only:  
#define Ch(b, c, d) ((b & c) ^ (~b & d))  
#define Maj(b, c, d) ((b & c) ^ (b & d) ^ (c & d))  
#define ROTR(x, n) (_mm_srli_epi32(x, n) | _mm_slli_epi32(x, 32 - n))  
#define SHR(x, n) _mm_srli_epi32(x, n)  
  
But that's with -O0.
