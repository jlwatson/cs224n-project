Are generated bitcoins encrypted with whichever address is currently displayed
in the main Bitcoin window?  

No, each generated transaction uses a new, single-use address.  
  
Nothing uses the address in the main window, it's just there for convenience
for you to copy. 0.2.5 has a "New..." button next to it to make it easy to
change each time you use it.
