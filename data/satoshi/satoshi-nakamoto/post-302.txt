The change list is basically encompassed by what's listed in the first
message.  Everyone should upgrade to get the important security improvements.  
  
Minimizing to tray had at least 3 different glitches and bugs on Linux,
including a crash one, so I disabled it again. You can still re-enable the
option with "-minimizetotray" if you want to use it anyway. The bugs/glitches
are somewhere in wxWidgets or GTK or Gnome and I don't know how to fix them.
Sorry, I just don't know what else to do, it's just too glitchy and buggy to
have as a mainline feature.
