I can't understand why you're having so much pain. I just followed the
instructions in build-unix.txt. I made a couple little corrections for Boost
1.37, which I'll put on SVN the next time I update it, noted below:  
  
Dependencies  
\------------  
sudo apt-get install build-essential  
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev  
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev  
sudo apt-get install libdb4.7-dev  
sudo apt-get install libdb4.7++-dev  
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev (or libboost1.37-dev)  
  
wxWidgets  
\---------  
cd /usr/local  
tar -xzvf wxWidgets-2.9.0.tar.gz  
cd /usr/local/wxWidgets-2.9.0  
mkdir buildgtk  
cd buildgtk  
../configure --with-gtk --enable-debug --disable-shared --enable-monolithic  
make  
sudo su  
make install  
ldconfig  
  
  
added a comment in makefile.unix:  
  
# for boost 1.37, add -mt to the boost libraries  
LIBS= \  
-Wl,-Bstatic \  
-l boost_system \  
-l boost_filesystem \  
-l boost_program_options \  
-l boost_thread \  
-l db_cxx \  
-l crypto \  
-Wl,-Bdynamic \
