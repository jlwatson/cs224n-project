Don't use the -server or -daemon switch or run bitcoind on a machine where you
use a web browser. It opens port 8332 on 127.0.0.1, the local loopback
address, and you wouldn't think that web browsers could cross-site access it,
but it is possible.  
  
We're working on a release soon that puts a password on the JSON-RPC
interface, but until then, avoid using the -server switch, and don't web
browse on the same machine where bitcoind is running.  
  
Update:  
The JSON-RPC HTTP authentication feature in 0.3.3 solves this problem.
