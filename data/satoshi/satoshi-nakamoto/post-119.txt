I doubt there's an mmap(2) on Windows. I'd rather call an existing file copy
function than make and test my own.  
  

But if you are already using features from boost::filesystem you can use
copy_file from that. I just think that, if not already required for something
else, it's a tad overkill.  

Thanks. I thought it would be in there somewhere.  
  
We already use boost::filesystem in a dozen places. It's not a new added
dependency. It gives us a lot of portable stuff that we would otherwise have
to have a #ifdef for each OS and test everywhere.
