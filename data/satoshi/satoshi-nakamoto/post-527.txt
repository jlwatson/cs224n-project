That's a good approach for mobile. Programmatic API used by PHP (any language)
to present a web UI covers remote admin, mobile and any other client that
can't be online all the time with a static IP. It would be like webmail. It
would be easier for new users to get started if they only need to create an
account on a website, not install software.  
  
Yeah, we can phase out IRC when there are enough static nodes to preprogram a
seed list. Once you get seeded, you don't need IRC.  
  
There were some issues in 0.1.5 where the initial block download could get
bogged down. 0.2 has code to make sure it goes smoothly. It ought to take less
than an hour, I think. I need to hurry up and get 0.2 out the door.  
  
The blocks increase linearly, it'll be decades before it's millions. In
theory, the block download time should top out 8 months from now when Moore's
Law will be growing faster than the block chain.  
  
It's SVN on sourceforge. PM or e-mail me your sourceforge account and I'll
give you access.  
  
That's great because that's where I have less expertise. For instance, I
haven't researched the best way to do the "Start Bitcoin on system startup"
feature on Linux. On Windows, the option adds/removes an icon in the Startup
folder.
