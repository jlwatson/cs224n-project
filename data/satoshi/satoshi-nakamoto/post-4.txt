@dtvan: all 3 excellent points.  
1) IP records don't need to be in the chain, just do registrar function not
DNS. And CA problem solved, neat.  
2) Pick one TLD, .web +1.  
3) Expiration and significant renewal costs, very important.  
  

Avoiding CPU power fragmentation is no longer a reason. Independent
networks/chains can share CPU power without sharing much else. See:
