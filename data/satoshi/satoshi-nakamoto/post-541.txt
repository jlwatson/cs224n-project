Could be. They're talking about the old Chaumian central mint stuff, but maybe
only because that was the only thing available. Maybe they would be interested
in going in a new direction.  
  
A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of
all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's obvious it was
only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I
think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based
system.
