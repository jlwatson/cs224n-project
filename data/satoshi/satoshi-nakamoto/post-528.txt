Helpful suggestions, thanks.  
  

That's a good idea. The side accepting the connection just needs to withhold
from sending anything until it receives a valid handshake. Any portscan would
only get a dead connection that doesn't volunteer to identify itself.  
  
I have thought about eventually SSLing all the connections. I assume anything
short of SSL would be pointless against DPI. Maybe a better more immediate
solution is to connect through TOR, which will be possible with 0.2.  
  
That's one of the main things on the agenda after 0.2.  
  
Yeah, the other stealth stuff would be kinda pointless if it's always the same
port number.  
  
I'm looking forward to trying UPnP. Do most P2P clients typically have UPnP
enabled by default?  
  
I'm still thinking about how best to structure the management interface. Maybe
command line commands to communicate with the background daemon to query
transactions received and initiate sending transfers. That would be more
automation friendly. Or what about an http interface on some port other than
80 to manage it with a browser?
