My fear is too many programmers would latch onto that for checking for
received payments. It can never be reliable that way. The
list/getreceivedbyaddress/label functions are the only way to do it reliably.  
  
We shouldn't delay forever until every possible feature is done. There's
always going to be one more thing to do.
