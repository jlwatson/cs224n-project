Here's some pseudocode of how you would use the account based commands. It
sure makes website integration a lot easier.  
  
print "send to " + getaccountaddress(username) + " to fund your account"  
print "balance: " + getbalance(username, 0)  
print "available balance: " + getbalance(username, 6)  
  
// if you make a sale, move the money out of their account  
move(username, "", amount, 6)  
  
// withdrawal  
sendfrom(username, bitcoinaddress, amount, 6)
