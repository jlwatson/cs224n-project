EXCEPTION: 22DbRunRecoveryException  
DBENv::open: DB_RUNRECOVERY: Fatal error, run database recovery  
C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin.exe in OnInit()  

What operating system?  
  
Normally when it does that it's because the directory where the data directory
should go doesn't exist. See if the "%appdata%" directory exists.  
  
Do you get that error with 0.2 also? It's hard to see how you could get that
with 0.3 and not with 0.2 since there's nothing different in that regard.
