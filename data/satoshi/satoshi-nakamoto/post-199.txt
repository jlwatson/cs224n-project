It doesn't have to be such a breaking change. New nodes could accept old
transactions for a long time until most nodes have already upgraded before
starting to refuse transactions without PoW. Or, they could always accept old
transactions, but only a limited number per time period.  
  
I've thought about PoW on transactions many times, but usually I end up
thinking a 0.01 transaction fee is essentially similar and better. 0.01 is
basically a proof of work, but not wasted. But if the problem is validating
loads of transactions, then PoW could be checked faster.  
  
A more general umbrella partial solution would be to implement the idea where
an unlikely dropoff in blocks received is detected. Then an attacker would
still need a substantial portion of the network's power to benefit from a DoS
attack.  
  

Bitcoin's p2p network is subject to various kinds of denial of service
attacks.  
  
There, I said it.

Any demonstration tests at this point would only show what we already know,
and divert dev time from strengthening the system to operational fire
fighting.
