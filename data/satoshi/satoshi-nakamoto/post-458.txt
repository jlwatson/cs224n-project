I don't know how to do SVG, but I did the original very large, over 500 pixels
across, so it can be scaled down. I'll give the original when I'm finished.  
  
I had to custom tweak each icon size so the vertical lines land square on
their pixels, otherwise they're ugly blurry and inconsistent. Such is the
challenge of making icons. The original will be good for scaling to custom
sizes between 48 and 500 but not smaller.
