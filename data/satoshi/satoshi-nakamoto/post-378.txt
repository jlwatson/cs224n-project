I reduced max outbound connections from 15 to 8 in RC4.  
  
15 was way more than we needed for redundancy.  8 is still plenty of
redundancy.  
  
As the nodes upgrade to this version, this will cut in half the number of
connections that inbound accepting nodes get.  
  
If anyone wants more than 8 connections, they can open port 8333 on their
firewall.
