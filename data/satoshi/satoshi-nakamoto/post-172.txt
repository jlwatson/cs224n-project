Patch is uploaded to SVN rev 132!  
  
For now, recommended steps:  
1) Shut down.  
2) Download knightmb's blk files. (replace your blk0001.dat and blkindex.dat
files)  
3) Upgrade.  
4) It should start out with less than 74000 blocks. Let it redownload the
rest.  
  
If you don't want to use knightmb's files, you could just delete your blk*.dat
files, but it's going to be a lot of load on the network if everyone is
downloading the whole block index at once.  
  
I'll build releases shortly.
