If you're so paranoid that you're getting hysterical over this, then surely
you're paranoid enough that if a warning message displays on the status bar,
you'll check the website and forum.  
  
I think if another bug like the overflow bug occurs, it's important that
automated websites stop trading until their admins can check out what's going
on and decide what to do.  If you decide it's a false alarm and want to take
your chances, you can use the "-disablesafemode" switch.
