GCC 4.3.3 doesn't support -march=amdfamk10. I get:  
sha256.cpp:1: error: bad value (amdfamk10) for -march= switch  
  
  
Hey, you may be onto something!  
  
hyperthreading didn't help before because all the work was in the arithmetic
and logic units, which the hyperthreads share.  
  
tcatm's SSE2 code must be a mix of normal x86 instructions and SSE2
instructions, so while one is doing x86 code, the other can do SSE2.  
  
How much of an improvement do you get with hyperthreading?  
  
Some numbers? What CPU is that?
