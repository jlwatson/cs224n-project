After it initially tries incorrectly to set itself to the lowest priority, the
generate thread only changes its priority again temporarily when it finds a
block. When you've found a block, you should want it to hurry up and broadcast
it as soon a possible before someone else finds one and makes yours invalid.
The generate thread only changes to higher priority for less than a second
every few days.  
  
There should be a 0.3.1 release for this soon. There are a few other issues we
need to look at fixing in 0.3.1 before making a release.  
  

That's interesting. I know the minimize to tray on Ubuntu is very clunky, but
I didn't know it had a CPU peg problem too. Anyone else able to reproduce this
problem? We had this feature disabled on Linux before, but then it seemed
better to have the imperfect UI than to lose the feature entirely. I'm
thinking we should disable it again on Linux.
