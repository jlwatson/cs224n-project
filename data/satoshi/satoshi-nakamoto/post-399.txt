Here's RC1 for linux for testing:  
(link removed, see below)  
  
It contains both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries.  
  
Recent changes:  
  
build-unix.txt:  
\- Added instructions for building wxBase, which is needed to compile
bitcoind.  
\- The package libboost-dev doesn't install anything anymore, you need to get
libboost-all-dev.  
\- Updated version numbers.  
  
makefile.unix:  
\- The libboost libraries have removed the "-mt" from their filenames in 1.40.
If you're compiling with Boost 1.38 or lower, like on Ubuntu Karmic, you would
need to change it back to boost_system-mt and boost_filesystem-mt.
