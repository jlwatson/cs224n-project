The order matters not to the program, but it matters to me maintaining it. If
it jumbles the order of the .po file then I can't diff for changes. I have to
update all 7 translation files when I change the English text in the program,
and it's easier when they're all in the same order.  
  
I can still put it back into normal order by making poedit rescan it.  
  
It is normal that untranslated strings are shown on top.  
  

I know, but not easily without complicating the sourcecode.
