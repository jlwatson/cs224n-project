Yeah, that actually is what it is. getallreceived 0 should do what you want.
(now it's renamed to listreceivedbyaddress 0) The default is 1 confirmation,
but I think in reality most digital goods and services can be 0 confirmations.
Like you say, if you need more than 0 confirmations, you could show two
numbers, unconfirmed and available balance, so they immediately see their
transaction went through.  
  
listreceivedbyaddress [minconf=1] [includeempty=false]  
[minconf] is the minimum number of confirmations before payments are included.  
[includeempty] whether to include addresses that haven't received any
payments.  
Returns an array of objects containing:  
"address" : receiving address  
"label" : the label of the receiving address  
"amount" : total amount received by the address  
"confirmations" : number of confirmations of the most recent transaction
included  
  
or listreceivedbylabel if you're labelling addresses with their username.  
  
So far I've concentrated on functions for web merchants, not so much on stuff
for remote management of headless coin generators yet.
