So you drop a settings file in the ~/.bitcoin directory, that sounds better.
In the "no password is set" warning, it could tell you where the file is and
what to do.  
  
What is the most popular and common settings file format?  
  
HTTP basic authentication should be considered. In actual practice though,
it's more work for web developers to figure out how to specify the password
through some extra parameter in the HTTP or JSON-RPC wrapper than to just
stick an extra parameter at the beginning of the parameter list. What do you
think? Does HTTP basic authentication get us any additional benefits? Moving
it off the parameter list but then you still have to specific it in a more
esoteric place I'm not sure is a net win.  
  

You're also confusing me, what do you mean? Did I do something unintended?
