So that was responsible for keeping blocks from downloading?  
  
The link: "Win32 CPU Cycles vs 'Live Protection' Engines"  
  
For BitcoinFX, Live Protection was keeping it from getting CPU for generating
coins. You said your friend was getting 1400-1600 khash/s, so it was getting
CPU. I guess Live Protection must have been blocking some other part of the
program then?
