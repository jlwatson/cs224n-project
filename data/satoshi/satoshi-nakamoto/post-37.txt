Thanks m0mchil for keeping up on the updates!  
  
GPU miners, please upgrade as soon as possible to shut down the free
transaction abuse! This version has the new priority-based limit on free
transaction spam.  
  
Before SVN 184, compiling transactions into a block used an n^2 algorithm. The
new efficient single-pass algorithm is orders of magnitude quicker. (O(n) vs
O(n^2)/2 algorithm, n=200 maybe 10 to 100 times quicker)
