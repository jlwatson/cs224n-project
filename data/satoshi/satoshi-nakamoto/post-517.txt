That's good, is it running fine on FreeBSD?  
  
I committed the changes to headers.h. For consistency, I used __BSD__. The
complete list of defines is at
http://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/wx_cppconst.html  
#ifdef __BSD__  
#include <netinet/in.h>  
#endif  
  
malloc.h is only needed on windows, I'll move that into the __WXMSW__ section
before it causes any more trouble.
