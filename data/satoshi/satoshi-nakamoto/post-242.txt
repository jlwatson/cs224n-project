So that last command should simply be  
 **sudo apt-get install libboost1.37-dev**  

Except that wouldn't work for boost 1.40+ (on Ubuntu 10.04), where you need to
get libboost-all-dev.  
  
Seems they changed everything around in Boost recently, "-mt" and all that,
makes it hard.  
  
BTW, I tried Boost 1.34 but it didn't have the boost.interprocess stuff.  
  
Mac OSX version is available now. See bitcoin.org or the SourceForge link.
