Mac support would be nice. wxWidgets really pays off for cross platform.  
  
Please don't try PPC. PPC is big-endian and Bitcoin is little-endian, there
would be endless endian bugs making it harder for me to debug the network if
there's a potentially byte-swapping node out there. PPC is on its way out
anyway.  
  
Considered autoconf. Autoconf is a necessity for large projects with a
quagmire makefile, but I think we're small enough that it's more optimal
without it. I'd rather keep the makefile simple as long as possible.  
  
My head hurts just thinking about that. Funnelling all the UI backend through
a TCP connection would make everything twice as hard. There's too much
bandwidth between the UI and the internal data structures in order to keep the
listview control updated, because of the way the listview control works.  
  
I'd rather have command line control, that would get us remote admin and batch
automation.
