It is my photo taken with my camera on a tripod in our
back yrd.  u can c tangerines (green) coming to fruition for
this Winter.  No doctoring.

In Soviet Union, I've read that sometimes, they painted
leaves n' fruits to make the surroundings nicer for the
hi level brass.  Perhaps, I should of painted the tree leaves
brown, fruits purple to throw you kids off.
