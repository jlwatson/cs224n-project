Fought with bureaucracy and their ineptitude based on complacency.  Contracting out (selling) most 
  important portion of services to private entities so we end up paying more for even a simple things
  they can do for us.  Same with our County health staff.

  Biking is my main enjoyment now.  As one biker said, it's refreshing.  Not like driving a car - dread
  with sitting low, getting frustered with too many cars even at 2:30PM (should be none rush hour)
  on our streets and freeways here in LA.  As soon as I get on the river path, I just feel free, enjoying the expanse.  Due to current heavy shower, there should be much more water flowing now too.
