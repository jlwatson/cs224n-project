Thx for your welcoming.

We should protect Bitcoin from take over by the few.  Its function should flow free as the Volga River 
despite the centuries of Tsars, Mongols, Vikings, Swedes, and the Communist regime rule.  We need to 
toss out any thinking of the apparent treasure in the boat over the the river as the Stenka Razin did to 
keep the boat rower and citizens free.  Keep the flow free and wide.

The Stenka's men were able to trust him to navigate the river and to support the poor.  In our case, 
Bitcoin does have a few generals to serve the crypto math, with many rowers (the open source 
programmers) to float in the river.  The concept of the Bitcoin is the captain of the ship.  Not a single or a group of people, which they may call themselves Oh, NO:

   A board of Directors

We need to preserve this structure.  No board of directors.  A few, governing many to navigate
in their own purpose, their own ports to deposit goods, ...  must not be allowed.

I see this happened to our great nation of USA.  535 legistrature governing 320 million of us making
us poor with their dealing with passing the measures put forth by another group of the few for
(subprime, derivatives, mortgage backed trust ...) and finally, the mandatory Obama care, making
e.g., drugs more expensive for the poor.

Same for the State, County, and down to the town/cities.  In our town, 5 counsel staff fooled us
to choke the already congested main street of Las Tunas by reducing the lane from 2 lane ea.
with diagnal parking, metering out our property money trickled down from the state to county
just to hand out contracts to more than one 'traffic study group and beautification firms' against
our citizen voices.  Same happening at our next door neighboring towns.  A few 5 counsels voting
themselves against 35K town citizens on allowing to build Monster houses as already done in our
town.  It's too late for me to understand the 'flow'.  The consel making this decision should of been stopped at the money flow.  As they say, follow the flow of $$.  From the State, County, then to
the town.  It should of stopped at higher level.  That Las Tunas drive portion belongs to my town
but it is a thoroughfare used by the thousands of commuters coming from the east side, like
Pomona, San Dimas, ... to downtown LA.  I've mentioned this in the counsel meeting but was ignored.
Call to the LA supervisor's office of Antonovitch was met by 'Oh, it doesn't belong to the county, it
belongs to your town'.  Yet, the county office metered out the $10 millions to do the diagonal parking.

I see the same for our corporate (capitalistic) structure.  A few, say 5 - 10 board of directors governing
the fate of all those who actually working day n' night, week after week with little pay and little
time off decide to send work out to Shanghi, laying off thousands of US workers while they get
millions in their salaries, compensations, bonuses, ... and more raises voting themselves.

Same for our Japanese American community, a microcosm level - Selling off Keiro Retirement Home complex by the few, the home's board of directors and the CEO.  They had no right to determine the fate 
of the all those senior residents, some in dire conditions and to their families and the seniors 
in waiting to get in by outright selling the facility without allowing the most important people to vote for 
no.  The proceed of $41 million was said to be used for educating about aging (huh?).  The $$ should be 
used to create new Retirement home without the board of selfish directors or CEOs.  Let the citizens make the laws and govern themselves without the greedy few.  Campigns, voting?  Elections?  do
these matter as the outcome of our citizens well being, both emotionally (promises), health and financial
security?  So goes for the global trade deals that US corporations thru our government and now every
other nations had gotten involved with the expense of our liveryhood.  Tell that to homeless here in LA.  The Globalization of trade as sought by the few (corporates pushing the representatives).

The concept of few governing many is wrong! 

No special interest or contractors thru the few counsel staff can corrupt 35K of town citizens or the few of 
industry money can corrupt 320 million of us citizens vs. 535 legislatures 

Protect Bitcoin from the few.  The banks can buy up all of the exchanges for instance.  The funding
for the Bitcoin development must be traced continuously and be protected from intrusions by the
few.  Always trace the $$.  Where to where, when to when, and mostly to whom to whom.

The few....
