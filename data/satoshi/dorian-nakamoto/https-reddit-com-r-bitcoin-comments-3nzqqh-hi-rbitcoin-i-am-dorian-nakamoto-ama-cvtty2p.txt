Yes, I enjoy a peddle cycle.  But also interested in motored
scooter some day to have a pretty lady sitting tight behind me.  Say an Italian classic Vespa or even an India made all metal Stella.
They both look classic.
Wished also to have my sons and daughters some day, one at a time to sit behind
me also to enjoy the ride to the CA beaches chasing the waves and
speeding clouds above.
