Yes, I still meet people in the groceries here, post office, and even at my fav., Carls Jr Hamberger
place as well as the IPS machineshop suppliers and adult class instructors both in El Monte as
well as at my local bank tellers.

Yes in I would like to see your town of Minneapolis.  I have a few friends from Danes of Minisota.
What's for lunch?  Thx.
