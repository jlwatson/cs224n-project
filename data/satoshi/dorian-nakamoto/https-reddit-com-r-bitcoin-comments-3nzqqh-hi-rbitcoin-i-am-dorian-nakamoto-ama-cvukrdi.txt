We can invent easier language - in grammar structure, EZ pronunciation* and writing
so anyone in this earth can learn it faster.  We remove excesses and unnecessary difficulties.
To start out, remove fem, masculine, and neuter assignments as in English.

*No hard pronunciation of words.  E.g., Remove words with no vowels between consonants.
  Remove long words but do not make them all monosyllable.  Else you'll end up with relying on
  tonnality to distinguish one mono from the other and to struggle to read the entire sentence
  as in some languages of the Far East.
