It's kind of strange about H0 (Half Zero scale though we call it
H Oh) loco need to have more weight so to pull more cars.
Weight must be placed on the driver wheels but also at the front
which would go up, off the rail during the initial stage of pull.

Same were done for the prototype Norfork & Western (N&W)'s
Y6b 2-8-8-2 locos.  Lead was added to pull more coal cars over 
their mountinous tracks

Ball bearings on the axles, motor shaft (if electric), and rods (if 0-scale or bigger) would also help to pull more cars.  So with the
real locos.

On the other hand, I've seen oil being purposely splashed/sprayed
over the rail top to increase efficiency on top of steel wheels on
steel rails for the prototype operations.  But not on a grade.
