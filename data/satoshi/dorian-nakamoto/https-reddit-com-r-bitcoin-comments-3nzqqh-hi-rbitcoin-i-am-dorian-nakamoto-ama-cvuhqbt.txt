Need to figure out how to ship such a volatile fuel 1st.  Like for instance, remove, or alter that volatile part and mix/alter back that 
component here when it arrives.  I bet any petroleum engineer can figure that out in a day.  Maybe it's even cheaper to ship in that
'just B4 it become fully functional gasoline' since that would be lighter than the dense crude.
