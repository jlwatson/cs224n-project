With 1.4 billion + 1.3 billion of the 3rd world nations all wanting
to buy cars, it's an illusion that the gas prices would be kept low
for long.  Here in LA, the supply (a glut of oil) from foreign and
now domestic didn't lower the price as in the other states.
The price is controlled by the few refineries (in particular, in
Torrance owned by Exxon, an oil company) with said supposed 
problem with refinary damage, workers strike, ...  The pump prices should be like $2.00/gal, not even $3/gal.  We should allow
gasoline itself imported from those OPECs directly to our gas pumps.  Or,have the OPECs construct more refineries here in So.
Cal to sell the gas directly.  That should bring the gas prices down
to $2/gal.  Won't allow monopoly.  Or, even the outer staters
have us import the fuel to LA.  But whoes controlling these
alternatives?  The few.  The very few.
