Dear Zoopz,

We're eagerly waiting for the young to change the world for the
better.  And hurrah for them in Hong Kong to whom are courageous young, all tank-men/tank women (Tinnamen Square). 
to protect their citizens and themselves against the tyranny of the
few.  Protect their future.  And to protect their entire nation's
progress for the betterment as a tiny but very significant sample of 
how wonderful their lives are as much freer citizens.  I wish to see
the same here from u in our nation, USA.  The government here
forced the Wall Street Occupiers, LA Occupiers, etc to shut down
with the stick welding police, protecting the 1% rich.  What's interesting is that the HK's parents too participated, recognizing their important roll.

Rock the boat!
