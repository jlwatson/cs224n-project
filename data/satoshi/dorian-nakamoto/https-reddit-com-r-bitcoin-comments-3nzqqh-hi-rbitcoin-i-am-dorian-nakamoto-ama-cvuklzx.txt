I doubt he had worked with me.  He was in the Academia as I understood.  If I was the creator, why or why should he use
his colleague's name?  That would be traceable esp. in that
environment of paper publications.  That environment of paper
production competition is fierce.  No respect or humor applicable
on naming.  

In my case, I just respect his creation.
