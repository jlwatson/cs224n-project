1.4B + 1.3B = ~3B.  That's 10x more than our .3B US population.
With just .3B, we're doing enough land, rivers, ocean, air, arctic
ice, our mountain ice, already with cars.  It's not just oil dig/frackting.  Its also mineral (Fe, Al, Cu, ...) dig destruction.  Now,
when the 1.4B + 1.3B wants same as US (2 - 3cars/family), the
polution and destruction of earth would be 10x as much.  We will be fearing not for global 'warming' but global 'heating' and global poisoning where there will be no reverse.

We need to get rid of individual ownership of cars to show it to the
world.
