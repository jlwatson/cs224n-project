Well, I appreciate the rocking you're creating here, all of you.  That figure was my defiant turtle face.  But my turtle shell
is too thin to match.  /u/cryptograffiti came to me last year, a gentleman within the Bitcoin community.  He had
donated time and energy to ward off the storm along with Andreas and all of you here.  He will soon auction the piece for my benefit.  The cut up credit card pieces signify the defiance to the nemesis along with the turtle.
My mother liked him very much.
