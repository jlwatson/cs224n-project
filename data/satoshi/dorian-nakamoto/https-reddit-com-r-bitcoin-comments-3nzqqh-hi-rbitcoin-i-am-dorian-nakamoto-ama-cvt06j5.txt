1. Ms. Goodman replaced my conditional:  "Even if I was involved ..."  and, I further explained that
I cannot disclose my work due to the engineer creed not to discuss employers sensitive information
which we signed before we are employed.  At the time, without knowing Bitcoin, I thought she was
asking about my work at Citibank.

2. Whether I am Satoshi Nakamoto of Bitcoin creator.  
This is what exactly happened.   Leah stalked me to come 
out and stayed ~45 minutes at my door steps which is later I've found not lawful.
Then she had disappeared. I saw her walking away from our driveway, around the
front sidewalk, turned abruptly back toward our house, looked like she was 
heading toward my side door.  So I called the sheriff.  She then re-appeared
with her car (which she parked away from my site when she knocked on my
door) while I was talking to the two officers on my driveway. 
I've told the two officers that I did not want to talk to the reporter.  But the 2nd sheriff
after talking to Leah came back to me (he went to talk to Leah in her car out on the
street) and advised me to talk to her else she won't  go away.  That sheriff supposed 
to be on my side.  I was not like a celebrity who would be badgered like this daily
and I gave in.
