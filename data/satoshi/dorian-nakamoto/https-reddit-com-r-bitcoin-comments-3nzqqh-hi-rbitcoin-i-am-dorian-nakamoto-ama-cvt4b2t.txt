 большое спасибо!  Thx very much.  That heavy shower here in our drought-ed LA as it started to
  pilt down helped my smile.  I've measured (inaccurately with a flat tub) it to be ~2 inches in
  about 1+ hour of that rain.  That is excellent for LA in 1 hr.  It only lasted ~1hr though.  Much
  heavier one came on mid last month for 6 hrs.

We in our household do conserve water, I think more than the neighbors.  We only water outside sparsely, with
sparse vegetation in the 1st place (let lawn be bare ground), flushing restrictions, use same dish and cup without
washing till end of the day, turn off shower while soaping, ...  No, I don't compensate my drinking water by buying
a cart full sized plastic bottled water as I've seen people coming out of the grocery stores.  Don't like plastic'ed
drinks anyway
