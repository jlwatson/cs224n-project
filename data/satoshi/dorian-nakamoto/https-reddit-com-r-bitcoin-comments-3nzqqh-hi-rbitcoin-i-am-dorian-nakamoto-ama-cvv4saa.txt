Dear muyuu n' ibtimes UK,

I like that Harry Potter left of me with his swift magic wand and 
glasses.

This was the scene just B4 I got into the AP reporter's car heading for the local sushi place.  Couldn't stay there due to the other 
reporters coming over to our table badgering.  So the Ap rptr got me back into his car (not Harry in the picture) and did the 
interview in his dwntwn LA office, evading his rivals.

Amazingly, when I decided to clear my case and shouted to the
flock of reporters outside from my front door saying whoever
provides free lunch I would give exclusive testimony, all came
rushing to my front door with their toad poles (the magic wands).

When I repeated my words, only one at the back of the flock
raised his hand.  That was the AP reporter I gave my testimony to.

Only 2 people other than the AP reporter and I along with the restaurant
employees would know the story after this scene photoed.  And all of my responses to you here
is of my name below.  Not the creator or anyone else.

I guarantee you.
