Hmm,  Spaghetti with clams, chicken and seafood cacciatore,
Kalamata olives, flank steaks, spicy ramen noodles; Chinese
shredded pork with bamboo, seaweed, and garlic sauce.
I think the Chinese cooking is the greatest for us, the пролетариат
class.

When I have some spare dough, toro sashimi.  But my rich cousins
take me to those restaurants.  And thank you AP (Associated Press)!

Frozen Claim Jumper's blue berry pie, cherry pie, peach pie (available at Ralph's and other grocery stores).  Jarlsberg and
Kerry Gold Dubliner chedder cheese (Norwegian n' Irish imports).
If it's an American cheese, it'll be Tillamook extra sharp chedder
from Oregon.  These are all available locally.
