tcatm's bitcoin-js-remote script gives you a "mybitcoin at home"
functionality. Run the Bitcoin client and his code on your home machine, open
up port 8338 incoming, and you can access your wallet remotely using your
mobile browser. It even creates and reads QR-codes for easy phone to phone
payments. You don't have to trust any third party service. Really this is such
a great concept, I don't know why it isn't better known.
