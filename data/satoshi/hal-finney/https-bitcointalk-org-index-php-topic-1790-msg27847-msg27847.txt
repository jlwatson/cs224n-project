My concern is that there would be a rush to grab hot domains. I would expect
that the first blocks generated with this system will all be maximum size and
filled with the equivalent of sex.com. These domain names are worth millions
of dollars, if the system succeeds. I suppose transaction fees would be
enormous, otherwise miners will just fill blocks with their own registrations.
Ordinary transactions would be crowded out, if this were part of Bitcoin.
