Here's what I would suggest. Create a new key pair in your code. Hash and sign
something like 'abc'. Then see if you can verify the signature. If it works,
publish the key and signature here. I can try to verify the sig with OpenSSL.
I was successful at verifying a Bitcoin signature, so this might reveal
differences in the two libraries.
