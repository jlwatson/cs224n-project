One thing I didn't follow about this was the supposed need to put the
private key onto the BBS in order to send encrypted mail.  This is not
necessary.  The private key is only used for signing messages.  For privacy
purposes in many cases encryption is sufficient.  PGP could be run on the
BBS to do encryption.
 
Of course, the local sysop could see your message as you compose it or
upload it to the BBS, but if you're then sending it through a BBS network it
can travel privately.
