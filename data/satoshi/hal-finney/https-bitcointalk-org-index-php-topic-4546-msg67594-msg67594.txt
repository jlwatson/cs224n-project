One case to consider is when you have addresses A and B in your wallet but
don't want them linked. Jollygreen's code will allow making sure you never
spend from A and B together, I think, so that's good.  
  
But suppose someone uses the multipay patch to send to both A and B together,
because they suspect that the addresses are linked. There are a few ways this
could go wrong. Suppose he told you he was sending 10 to A, but also includes
1 to B in the transaction. I'm not sure what the client would do, but it might
show you receiving 11. Then you'd be like, dude, you sent me 11 not 10. And
he'd be like, you're busted.  
  
Another way it could go wrong is that you could spend them together, and
again, you're busted. I think Jollygreen is protecting against this.  
  
Yet another failure mode would make it impossible to spend the funds, because
it would break the rules. So sipa's patch needs to be part of this, allowing
the outputs to be split.
