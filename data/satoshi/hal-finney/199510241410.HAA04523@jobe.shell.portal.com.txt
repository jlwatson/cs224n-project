The problem with this is that Bob and the bank can now collude to trace
Alice, since he sees what she sent to the bank.  This is not as bad as in
the forward traceability case of regular ecash, because it happens after
Alice has completed her bank transaction, rather than before, but it
would be better to be untraceable since that is the whole point of this
variation.
