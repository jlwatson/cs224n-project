Hi, I've just joined this list.

Interesting confusion about Mr. Squirrel.  That's one of the problems
with anonymity.  How do you know you're talking to the right person?

What you should do is to use a public key.  The pseudonym is not
really the name "Secret Squirrel"; anybody can use that.  The pseudonym
is the public key.  Any message signed by that particular key is from
that particular squirrel.  Any message you encrypt in Squirrel's public
key is readable only by him.  If Squirrel changes his key, he should
sign the message so you know it's really _that_ squirrel who's changing
his key (and not some other squirrel telling people to use a new key).

A pseudonym is a public key.


P.S. Here's my key, signed by PRZ:
