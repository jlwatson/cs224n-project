design/implement a secure DNS-like "map string to bitcoin address" system (so
I can send bitcoins to "gavin@acm.org")  

  
This might be nice but I don't see it as a prerequisite for 1.0.  
  
In the discussion on BitDNS, there was resistance to overloading the main
chain as a title registry. Another chain a la BitDNS could be used to map
general strings to btc addresses, as well as domain names.  
  
One issue is it pretty much has to be first come first served. Whoever grabs
gavin@acm.org first, gets it. There wouldn't be any way to verify ownership of
the address.
