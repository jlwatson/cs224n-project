Bill is referring to an announcement I made elsewhere about a bignum
package I am working on in Java.  Take a look at to play with a
little interactive "calculator" I made with it.  You need a Java enabled
browser to use it.

I think Bill's idea is a good one but I will discuss it further on
coderpunks since it gets into some technical aspects of Java that may not
be of general interest.
