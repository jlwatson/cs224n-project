The bottleneck is an elliptic curve multiply, which takes about 2 ms, for
500/sec. However if you just want to generate addresses as fast as possible,
you can repeatedly increment the private key while adding G to the public key.
I have a patch to Gavin's vanity-address search that does this. It should
speed it up by a factor of 300 or so. So that would be 150,000 addresses/sec
maybe.
