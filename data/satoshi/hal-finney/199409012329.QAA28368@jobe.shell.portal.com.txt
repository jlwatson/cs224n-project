(I have rearranged James' two paragraphs)


There are protocols to do essentially this, although they get
rather complicated.  It is necessary for each person in the chain
to have some knowledge of the person he is passing the money to,
so that he can confirm that that person is in fact revealing something
about himself that will incriminate him if he double-spends.  If all
parties in the transactions are totally anonymous then there is no
hope of tracking down a double-spender.


My reading of Chaum's paper "Transferred Cash Grows in Size" is that
if you have a system to satisfy the 1st paragraph, it cannot also satisfy
this.  It appears that if B, E and the bank collude, and B knows he gave
the cash to C and E knows that he got it from D, then they can tell that
C gave it to D.  Basically B recognizes the money E got from D, with
the bank's help.  Although Chaum wrote as though his results applied to
any conceivable transferrable double-spending-detecting cash system,
it wasn't clear to me how general his results really were.
