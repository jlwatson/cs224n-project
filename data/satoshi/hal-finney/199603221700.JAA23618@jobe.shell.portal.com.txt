PGP checks specifically for the case of keys whose IDs match but the
keys themselves differ.  It has always been obvious that keys can easily
be synthesized with given IDs.  I added this warning in version 2.0
about four years ago, in the keyadd code:

"\n\007Warning: Key ID %s matches key ID of key already on
key ring '%s', but the keys themselves differ.
This is highly suspicious.  This key will not be added to ring.
Acknowledge by pressing return: "


As you can see, it does in fact literally ring an alarm bell - the "\007"
above is the ASCII bell character.

Disclaimer: I have not worked on PGP since version 2.0 so possibly my
code has been changed or eliminated, but I think that is unlikely.
