I thought of a possible problem with all these proposals: front-running by
miners. This is where a miner sees an attempt to register a name, thinks it is
a good name, and registers it for himself instead. Since domain registration
fees are based on the value of average names, extra-good names wouldn't be
covered by the fees and might be stolen in this way. Some existing registrars
have been accused of a similar practice, registering names through agents
after people query for name availability.
