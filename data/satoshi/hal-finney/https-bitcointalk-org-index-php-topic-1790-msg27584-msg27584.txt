Actually I am concerned that transactions between BTC and DCC may not be
simple. Because both currencies tend to be anonymous, it is hard to make the
two transfers in a coordinated way. If Anne wants to sell Beth 1 DCC (allowing
1 domain to be created) for a certain number of Bitcoins, then Beth must send
Anne the Bitcoins via the Bitcoin block chain, while Anne sends Beth the DCC
on the DomainChain. If the two are anonymous to each other, it seems there
must be a trusted third party like a reputable exchange. It seems hard to do
peer to peer.
