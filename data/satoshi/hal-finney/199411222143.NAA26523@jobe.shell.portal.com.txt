It's kind of ironic, because on the one hand Borenstein is using
some nice technology which would lend itsef very well to crypto
protocols, electronic cash, and other privacy-protecting transactions.
But it is being used to facilitate VISA card payments and many people
have raised questions about the security of the system.

When you place an order, you get a safe-tcl style "enabled mail"
message (which Tim would hate!).  This is readable but if you have
safe-tcl running it will actually pop up a dialog box or something
which you can click on to confirm your payment.  I think this would
be a good thing for DigiCash to copy if/when they start supporting
email transactions.  It would be fun for Magic Money too.

Borenstein and First Virtual also have a whole set of MIME extensions
for electronic transactions which might also serve as a model for
more general types of payments.  Maybe Rich could ask whether they
are considering that.

In general, FV has a lot of good ideas IMO, but it's too bad they
are still tied to the old models of payment.
