I'd add speed, you shouldn't have to wait too long for a transaction to go
through. Bitcoin gets a B-, it's fast enough for a lot of things but too slow
for some.  
  
Scalability, could it be used for every transaction, everywhere in the world?
In its current form I'd say no, but possibly with the addition of lightweight
clients. So I'll say C, has potential but not there yet.
