Well, this is not necessarily the case.  A MITM may be signing my
messages for me, and then putting them back the way they were before I
am allowed to see them.  Granted, this would not be easy, and perhaps
the difficulty of this would be great enough that you will feel
comfortable using an unsigned key.  But if it were accomplished, then
your messages to me would actually be insecure.  No matter how
convinced you became of my sincerity and trustworthiness, actually our
conversations would be overheard by a third party despite both of our
efforts to the contrary.  Our use of encryption would be rendered
futile.  Doesn't this bother you?
