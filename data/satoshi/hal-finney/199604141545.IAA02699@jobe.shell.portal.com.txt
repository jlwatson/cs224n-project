Blowfish has not been broken in my opinion.  I wonder if Perry is
thinking of MacGuffin, the block cipher by Schneier and Matt Blaze
based on an asymmetrical Feistel network.  It was broken, and I think
it was at Eurocrypt.

Here is a message from sci.crypt a month ago where Bruce discusses the
status of Blowfish.  A weak key attack is known against a weakened
version, but I think the weak keys are rare.
