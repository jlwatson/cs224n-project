I finally got around to building my own client from source (on Ubuntu) and the
first thing I did was to add sound effects. I now hear a little pop whenever
there's a transaction, and a chime when there's a new block.  
  
It was easy, here's the diff for main.cpp, just 3 lines:  
  

Code:

diff --git a/main.cpp b/main.cpp

For snd_tx.wav I used http://www.series-of-articles.com/sfx/snd/pop.wav; for
snd_blk.wav I used http://www.series-of-articles.com/sfx/snd/bell.wav.  
  
A quick hack, but entertaining and informative.
