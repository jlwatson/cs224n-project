I really like Adam's very creative idea earlier in this thread to have a pure-
zerocoin system:  
  
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175156.msg2420768#msg2420768  
  
The zerocoin paper proposed a hybrid bitcoin-zerocoin system. Bitcoins would
be temporarily exchanged for zerocoins, and then exchanged back. Adam's idea
was that zerocoins would be exchanged directly for zerocoins. Zerocoins could
be mined directly, too. All this is a simple modification of the zerocoin
protocol. In fact, it would be simpler in terms of code size, because you
wouldn't have to support bitcoin transactions. No scripting language, no
bitcoin validation rules. Just pure zerocoin spend transactions.  
  
This would also free us from the forced assumption of bitcoin-zerocoin parity.
The heavy resource requirements of zerocoin might naturally break that parity.
(Admittedly, zerocoin would first be implemented as an extension to an alt, so
the value in terms of bitcoins would float. But the simplification is still a
win.)  
  
There are various proposals to do P2P exchanges between altcoin chains. I
don't know what the status is as far as Bitcoin support in the bitcoin-qt
client. You'd have to have a new client to do the P2P protocol. But even if we
had to rely on an exchange, it would be an interesting experiment.  
  
The last problem for a zerocoin implementation is the generation of an RSA
modulus for which no one knows the factorization. This is hard, and deserves
more analysis.
