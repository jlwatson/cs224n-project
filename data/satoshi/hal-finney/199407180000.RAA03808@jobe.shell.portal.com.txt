I suspect this protocol is covered by the Diffie-Hellman patent, which is
quite broad, covering many sorts of key exchanges.  Diffie-Hellman is now
owned by PKP, the sister company to RSA.  If so, Shamir has not undercut his
own financial interests by this work.  (Also, this does not obsolete PK
since it requires several exchanges before communication can occur, making
it inappropriate for high-latency communications, such as for most email.)
