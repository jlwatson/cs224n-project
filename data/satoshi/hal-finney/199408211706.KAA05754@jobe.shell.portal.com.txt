rah@shipwright.com (Robert Hettinga) writes (quotes are Eric Hughes):


One difference between ecash and bonds is that bonds generally pay interest
(to the bond holder, not to the lender!), while ecash may not.  I also
suspect that most ecash will have a fixed maximum lifetime beyond which it
is no good, due to technical problems in keeping lists of spent notes.  So
it would not necessarily be callable in theway Bob describes.



I think Eric is referring to how the notes are denominated, and the possibility
that they may bear interest.  A note could be marked as worth $1 + 6% per
year past 1994, expiring in 1998, for example.


Fair?  Who cares?  The question is, is it useful?  Sure it is.  I'd rather
use cash which bore interest than that which didn't!  Sure, it's a little
more complicated to buy something with notes which are worth $1.05 - $1.10
than $1.00, but that's what computers are for.  The value increase accrues
to whomever holds the note during the time they hold it.


Sure; just don't say "the solution is".  You issue non interest bearing
notes and live on the float; I issue interest notes and live off the
exchange fees.  Let the market decide.
