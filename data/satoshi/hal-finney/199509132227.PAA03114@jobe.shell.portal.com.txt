Yes, I think this was the idea of the original "software key escrow"
proposal, from TIS as I recall.  The sender would encode the session key
with a government public key but there was some trick by which the
receiver would verify that the session key was in fact encoded correctly
and refuse to operate if it was wrong.  So any attempt to corrupt or
remove the LEAF would be detected if you were talking to a compliant
receiver.

That is part of why Matt Blaze's Clipper attacks were so significant,
because they went to the heart of this requirement.  It was always clear
that you could superencrypt with Clipper, but Matt found a way in which
you could send a LEAF which would be accepted by a regular Clipper phone
but which had bogus data for law enforcement.  So this defeated the
requirement of not interoperating with rogues.
