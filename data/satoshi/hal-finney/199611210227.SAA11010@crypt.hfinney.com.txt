I take a slightly different moral.  Baker (former NSA attorney) writes:


What I see this as is a call to come up with architectures that will allow
transparent phase-in of government key access (so-called "key recovery")
technology.  The current HP proposal fits in very well with this model.
The appear to be planning on using standard API's so that applications
will be able to switch to using key escrow software without changing the
applications themselves, just the OS.  Maybe there could be a transition
period where both the old and new crypto would both be accepted, then
after a period of time the old wouldn't work any more.

As Baker goes on to say:


This suggests to me that we need to be vigilant in watching for systems that
will allow for easy "drop in" of key escrow.
