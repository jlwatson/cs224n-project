179c7kVKJNxJN1TJ8EqcFhzXDAkrMqr2uB will not even see my transaction in their
client because they don't know how to read that modified transaction. It will
still be in the block chain, though.  

  
Ah, thanks. Is this just a UI issue with display of transactions, or do the
clients not recognize the transfer of value at all? If that address
179c7kVKJNxJN1TJ8EqcFhzXDAkrMqr2uB goes on to spend its value (supposing its
client was patched to allow it), would the transaction be accepted as valid?
