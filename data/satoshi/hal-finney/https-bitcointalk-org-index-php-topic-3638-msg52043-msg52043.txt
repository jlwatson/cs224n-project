Congratulations Mike! That was fast, you got the bitcoins only two blocks
later. Not only that, you had to create a transaction with 5 inputs,
corresponding to the 5 payments into the address. Do you mind telling how you
did it?  
  
As far as use cases, you could email someone some bitcoins without knowing
their address, or even if they hadn't tried Bitcoin yet. Some people want to
print bitcoins on paper and put them in a safe for long term security. If you
could pay bitcoins to a newly created key, and export the private key, it
would be a backup that would be safe against wallet theft. Lots of people have
asked for this.
