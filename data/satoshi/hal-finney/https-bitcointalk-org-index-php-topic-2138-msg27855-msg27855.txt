We're at block 96,000+ now and block 100,000 is in sight. At current rates it
should show up by Christmas, depending on how much computing power increases
by then.  
  
Anybody up for a pool betting on when block 100,000 will appear? Say 1 Bitcoin
per person? Post your guess here (UTC only) and commit to paying 1 btc to
whomever's closest. Let's close the guessing after block 98000 so late
guessers don't have too much advantage.  
  
I'll start and pick noon Christmas day, for fun.
