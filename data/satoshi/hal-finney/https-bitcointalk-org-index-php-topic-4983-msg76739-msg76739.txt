Steve, the way the client works now, all the wallet keys are read into memory
at startup. Subsequent changes are made in memory and written to disk. This
proposed patch decrypts keys as they are read into memory at startup, and
encrypts new keys as they are written out to disk.  
  
Decrypting keys on use wouldn't be too hard. Add a popup to read the
passphrase, perhaps cache it for a while as you suggest.  
  
Strangely, the hard part is encrypting new keys, because Bitcoin creates keys
at odd times. The oddest time is when receiving a payment to the "current
address" displayed at the top of the window. Bitcoin likes to keep things
fresh so it generates a new address to display, and new key. But it can't
encrypt the new key without the passphrase, and in general no user is around
to respond to a popup at random times.
