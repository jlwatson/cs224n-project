Would it have to be public knowledge which message havens a given
pseudonym monitors?  Suppose I want to get mail to Pr0duct Cypher; don't
I have to know which haven(s) to use?  If we have only a (few?) hundred
people on each haven then this narrows down the pool of possible real
user who are behind that pseudonym considerably.
