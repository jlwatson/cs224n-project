Several people have mentioned they are working on mobile clients (at least
Android, don't know about iOS). But I haven't seen much discussion of the
design in terms of security and performance issues.  
  
In another thread,
http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2957.msg41905#msg41905, [mike] made a
provocative comment: "1) Are you trying to make an Android client? You don't
want to verify transactions if so."  
  
Can mobile clients get away without verifying transactions? Maybe they could
just rely on the block chain. Any transaction in a block that has enough
confirmations is considered to be good. Checking blocks is both easy and
quick, pretty much just hashing.  
  
The one problem I see would be a possible delay in knowing that payments to
you are valid. It wouldn't matter for payments to merchants who can run
regular clients, but payments from one mobile user to another might be slow to
be validated.  
  
Another possible shortcut would be for mobile clients not to forward blocks,
transactions, and addresses the way regular clients do. Network transmissions
draw a lot of power. Mobile nodes could just leech. If they don't process
transactions, they wouldn't even need to read those.  
  
iOS doesn't have true multitasking. I don't think a client could receive the
block chain in the background. Android presumably doesn't have this problem,
but the question would be impact on battery life to keep the client running
all the time.
