Actually the OP observed that the software always puts the change first. I was
working on a separate project suggested by Mike Hearn, using the new secure
"trusted computing" modes on modern cpus to enforce spending limits even when
infested with malware. I'm using Jon McCune's flicker software from
sourceforge. The secure mode signs transactions and enforces limits on spends,
but to know the transaction amount it has to know which is the change
output.So I was just looking at this code yesterday and scratching my head
(figuratively). I'll post more on this project when it's further along.  
  
As far as my donation address, I created that years ago using Gavin's original
vanitygen patch. I don't even know if I still have the key. It might be on a
computer I don't use any more. I've substituted one of my offline savings
wallet addresses. I shouldn't lose that.I'm not hurting for bitcoins; I
started running the first day (and gave up after a few weeks because of the
fan noise). Still, it's the thought that counts - thanks!
