We know that Bitcoin's resistance to attack is based on the cost for the
attacker to overwhelm the network, or at least to control a large fraction of
its computing power. We assume this cost will continue to rise in the future
so attacks will be infeasible even for well-funded attackers.  
  
But the computational power of the network is proportional to difficulty; and
it appears that difficulty is proportional to bitcoin price. It follows that
unless bitcoins become substantially more valuable than they are today, the
Bitcoin network will never be substantially more resistant to attack than it
is today.  
  
For Bitcoin to succeed and become secure, bitcoins must become vastly more
expensive.
