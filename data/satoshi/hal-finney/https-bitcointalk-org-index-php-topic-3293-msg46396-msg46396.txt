IMO one way to get a handle on a reasonable value for 1 bitcoin is via this
formula:  
  
probability Bitcoin ultimately succeeds * value of 1 bitcoin if it succeeds  
  
Bitcoin has the potential to become the dominant currency for large-scale
electronic transactions worldwide. If this happens, bitcoins could be worth
millions of dollars each.  
  
So what is the probability of such a grandiose outcome? One in a million?
Maybe so.  
  
I see the recent increase in value as a rise in the consensus probability that
Bitcoin will succeed.
