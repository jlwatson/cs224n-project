One reason price might follow difficulty is that mining should not be too
profitable (because nothing should be too profitable, the world doesn't leave
free money lying around). Therefore the price of Bitcoins can't rise too much
above the cost of mining (counting equipment depreciation among the costs of
course). The cost of mining is proportional to the difficulty (approximately).
Therefore we might expect to see price proportional to difficulty.  
  
We do see a nearly proportional relationship in the 1st graph, but that data
set was incomplete. I'd like to see that last graph redone with a linear
difficulty scale so we could see how the proportionality holds up with more
data.
