I'm kind of surprised that Mike's transactions didn't show up in my wallet.
Instead it still counts that address as having a positive balance. Granted it
is non-standard for payments from my wallet keys to originate elsewhere, but
there are other ways it could happen, involving restoring from backup.  
  
Well I just looked at the code, and it does only watch for transactions that
pay me. However it looks like the new release will rescan the block chain on
startup; that will probably fix it. I wonder how costly it would be to watch
for outgoing transactions all the time.  

  
I just upgraded to 0.3.20, and while it didn't find Mike's transaction
automatically, I ran with the new -rescan switch and that picked it up. Only
took 10 or 15 seconds on my Macbook Air.
