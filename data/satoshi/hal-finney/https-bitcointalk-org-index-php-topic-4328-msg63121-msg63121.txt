I don't believe the software does this now, but a miner could copy the
transaction from your block, and include both that and the one with the txn
fee in its new block. Then it could collect the fee even if it built on
another block than yours.  
  
Maybe it would work to make the fee transaction depend on your 50 btc creation
fee. That one can't be moved.
