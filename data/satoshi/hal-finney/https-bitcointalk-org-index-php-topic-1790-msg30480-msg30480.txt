"To implement this simply requires adding one new field to each transaction,
the 'name' (or hash) of the 'stock' being transferred."  
  
In the case of DNS this still leaves the problem of discovering where in the
world are your DNS records hosted. I think you need one more piece of data,
the IP addresses of your authoritative DNS name servers.  
  
I'm unclear on who gets to register new names in your scheme, how much they
have to pay, and who receives thevpayment. Also, are name registrations
permanent and forever?
