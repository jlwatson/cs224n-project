Okay, I've confirmed that hashes OK using sha256sum and gets your value,
0f898c5494eaa468d12cf0630a0c0b238cc1149c1c53bbc592d16497094e95ff. So the
question remains to verify the sig.  
  
You will have to add 01 00 00 00 to the end before you hash, for the hashtype.  
  
I'm not sure about your scriptsig shortening. You removed the sig ok, but
there seems to be more stuff added at the end, after the pubkey.
