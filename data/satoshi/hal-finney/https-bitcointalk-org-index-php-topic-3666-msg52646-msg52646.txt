Did you ever get this? Here's some minimal code that might work. Add to
rpc.cpp after getwork:  

Code:

Value broadcasttransactions(const Array& params, bool fHelp)  
{  
if (fHelp || params.size() < 1)  
throw runtime_error(  
"broadcasttransactions <hexencodedtransaction> ...\n"  
"Broadcasts specified transaction(s) out onto the network.");  
  
for(int param=0; param<params.size(); param++)  
{  
string strTx = params[param].get_str();  
CDataStream vMsg(ParseHex(strTx));  
CTransaction tx;  
vMsg >> tx;  
CInv inv(MSG_TX, tx.GetHash());  
RelayMessage(inv, tx);  
}  
return Value::null;  
}  

  
Then add at the end of pCallTable (the next code block):  

Code:

make_pair("broadcasttransactions", &broadcasttransactions),  

  
Maybe add "broadcasttransactions" to that next table, pAllowInSafeMode,
otherwise I guess you have to start the server with -disablesafemode.  
  
This is untested, I only spent about half an hour on it, so you don't have to
pay if you use it.
