Wow, that's bizarre that the byte order of the hashes is reversed on the wire
like that. Have you tried reproducing the published transaction hash by
hashing the raw transaction? Does that work? What do you get, 0f89... as it is
on the wire, or the reverse, ff95... as blockexplorer has it? And do you need
to byte reverse the embedded hashes in the tx in order to get the right
answer?
