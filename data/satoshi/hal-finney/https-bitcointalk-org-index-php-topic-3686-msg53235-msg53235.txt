What about difficulty adjustments though? Difficulty will increase by a factor
of 4 every 2016 blocks. Current difficulty is > 32000 or 2^15, plus the
implied 32 bits for an actual value of 2^47, ie 47 bits of zeroes at the front
of the hash. We add 2 more zeroes every 2016 blocks, so after 105 such
adjustments, the target will be all zeroes!  
  
However, I peeked at the code, and even an all-zero target can be met with an
all-zero hash. So theymos is right, Mr Lucky (who I think has an infinitely
fast computer in his pocket) can go all the way, as fast as the net can
broadcast blocks.
