I modified the bc_key program originally by dirtyfilthy, to dump out info on
everything in the wallet.dat file.

It prints out keys (as addresses), transaction hashes, key pool addresses,
address book names, etc.

Run it as:

or wherever your wallet.dat might be. I like to pipe the output through sort.

I've noticed two oddities in the couple of wallets I've looked at:

There are no wkey entries, only keys. wkeys would hold extra stuff with Merkle
branches and all that. Is this not yet (or no longer) supported, present in
the code for the hypothetical "lightweight client"?

I have a very old wallet, created by the first version of bitcoin. Recently I
upgraded to a modern version. However, the wallet has no pool entries. I
thought the upgrade would create 100 keypool entries?
