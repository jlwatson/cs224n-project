  
I think that was Joe's suggestion: if a block shows up that turns one or more
previously-broadcast transactions into double-spends, you don't count it.
Maybe we could give it a negative difficulty penalty, so that the block chain
with this block would have lower cumulative difficulty than without it; that
way it would stay an orphan and not be added to the chain. Then if it was all
a big mix-up and other nodes kept building on this one, eventually they would
overcome the negative difficulty and it would be accepted, as Joe proposed
with his 6-block rule.  
  
Obviously changing the voting rules like this would need careful analysis.
