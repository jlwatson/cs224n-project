Since we're all rich with bitcoins, or we will be once they're worth a million
dollars like everyone expects, we ought to put some of this unearned wealth to
good use. What better than to send our benefactor Satoshi to the Financial
Cryptography conference.

FC is traditionally held at luxurious island resorts, and this year is no
exception. Satoshi could meet the movers and shakers of the financial and
cryptographic worlds while enjoying the beautiful beaches of St. Lucia.
Unfortunately it is too late for him to speak, but given Bitcoin's enormous
growth and potential, no doubt he would make many valuable connections. Indeed
it may well turn out that Bitcoin becomes the single most successful example
of Financial Cryptography.  
  
FC does tend to be expensive. We appear to have missed the cutoff for cheap
rooms. We probably need to budget $300 a night or about $1500. Add ~$500 for
registration, maybe $2000 for travel, and we're talking about $4K or so. If 40
people chipped in $100 we'd be golden.  
  
This is our chance to give something back to the creator of this fantastic new
form of money, or currency, or payment system, or whatever. All we need is
Satoshi's agreement and we can get started.
