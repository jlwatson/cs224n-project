There's good discussion of this feature here:  
  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues#issue/3  
  
https://gist.github.com/803170  
  
Issues:  
  
\- Symmetric (aes) vs public key (rsa) encryption  
  
\- Decrypt at startup vs decrypt on use  
  
\- Create new keys automatically (as now) vs create only on user action  
  
\- Encrypt all keys with same passphrase vs different passphrases for
different key sets  
  
One way to analyze these is via a threat model. What can the attacker do, that
we will try to defend against? And what will we not defend against?  
  
We can distinguish three levels of attacker:  
  
1\. Can read user files  
  
2\. Can read/write user files but only read system files  
  
3\. Can read/write everything, root privileges  
  
  
Sorry, getting tired, will write more later.".
