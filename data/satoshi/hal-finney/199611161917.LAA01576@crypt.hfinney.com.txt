The company I work for, PGP, Inc., announced yesterday that it had bought
PrivNet, makers of Internet Fast Forward cookie-blocking software.  More
info is on the PGP web site at http://www.pgp.com/.  Personally I have a
passionate and irrational hatred of cookies so I am very glad to see this
move!  I can accept them if I'm browsing through an online store and they're
being used to keep track of what I've bought, but so many sites these days
are just snoopy as far as I can tell.  Down with cookies!
