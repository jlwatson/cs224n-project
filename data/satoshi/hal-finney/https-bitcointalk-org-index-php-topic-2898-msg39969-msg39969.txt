I think it will work to give change to the paying Bitcoin address. The client
avoids this for privacy reasons - it tries to hide which output is payment and
which is change. But it should work.  
  
Oh, wait, you want to feed the change back into the card, don't you? That's
trickier, because Bitcoin payments must reference the hash of the source
transaction. What you need to do is store on the card the original source
transaction hash (that funded the address on the card). Then when you make a
payment, the terminal uses this for the txin, and creates a tx that gives
change back to your address. It computes the hash of this new transaction and
writes it back to the card. This will then be used as the txin for the next
payment.  
  
Does anyone know a smart card that supports ECDSA signatures?
