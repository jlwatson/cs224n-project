Here are a couple of perl scripts I wrote last year to add padding to PGP
encrypted files.  The usage would be:

perl pgppadt.pl filename bytestoadd

The output file is filename.pad.

It only works on binary ".pgp" public-key encrypted files (not ascii armored
files).  So there would be some work needed to make it a really useful tool.
It would also be better to use a strong source of random numbers.  I
think Carl Ellison recently posted some tools that could help with this.
The two files are pgppad.pl, which does the work, and pgppadt.pl, a very
simple test driver to show how to use it.  They are in a shar archive.
