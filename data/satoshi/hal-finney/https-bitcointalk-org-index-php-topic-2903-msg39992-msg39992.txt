The EMH says that market prices are approximately "correct" and you can't
expect large gains. Yet many Bitcoiners expect large increases in the price of
bitcoins. Is the EMH failing in the Bitcoin market, giving us a true free
lunch? Or are Bitcoin investors deluding themselves by not recognizing the
likelihood of loss?
