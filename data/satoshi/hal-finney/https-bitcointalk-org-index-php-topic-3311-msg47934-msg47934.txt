The problem is this code in main.h:GetMinFee(), called from
main.cpp:AcceptToMemoryPool()  
  
601 // To limit dust spam, require a 0.01 fee if any output is less than 0.01  
602 if (nMinFee < CENT)  
603 foreach(const CTxOut& txout, vout)  
604 if (txout.nValue < CENT)  
605 nMinFee = CENT;  
  
  
This will prevent clients from forwarding transactions with outputs < 0.01
btc. We can change this rule but not everyone upgrades so lower value
transactions will propagate unreliably for months.  
  
I suggest we figure out how to fix this once and for all, put in the new rule
but set it to trigger only as of some block number in the future, and
meanwhile do something cool in the client so people will want to upgrade
before the rule change.
