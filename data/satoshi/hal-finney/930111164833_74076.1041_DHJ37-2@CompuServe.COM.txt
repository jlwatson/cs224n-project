I'd like to hear more about systems which do this.  What is the rationale
for adding the system name at the end?  Do these networks not use
Internet-style "From:" headers, so these automatic system-wide .sigs are
used for the same effect?

I guess there must be gateways between these bbs's and the internet,
for this issue to arise.  It's too bad that these gateways don't convert
the .sig info into a more conventional RFC-822 style Internet header.
