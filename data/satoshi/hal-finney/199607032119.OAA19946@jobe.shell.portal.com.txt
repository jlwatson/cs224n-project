I have simple code for a "proxy" key server on my web server.  It is not
a real key server, but just forwards requests to a real key server.  It
has a list of a few servers that it knows about and it tries the list
until one responds.  I use it for Java applets which get PGP keys from
the server; they have limitation that they can only connect back to the
server they came from.  So this solves that problem.

Code and a sample Java applet are available from: <URL:
