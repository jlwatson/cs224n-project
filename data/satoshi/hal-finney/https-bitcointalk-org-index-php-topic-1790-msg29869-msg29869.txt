Seems like everyone's tugging in a different direction. Here are some of the
specific issues:  
  
1\. Bitcoin main chain vs start a new chain, with DCCs ("DomainChain coins").  
  
2\. Permanent name registration vs renewal necessary.  
  
3\. Support for an unlimited family of applications vs just focus on DNS.  
  
4\. DNS "gateway" servers setting minimum transaction fees vs burning a DCC to
register a domain.  
  
5\. Include in the block chain, in addition to domain name: just ownership
public key, vs ownership public key plus authoritative DNS server IP
addresses, vs arbitrary DNS records.  
  
6\. Single TLD .web or .p2p, etc., vs "advisory" TLDs which may be ignored,
versus all TLDs being allowed in names.  
  
Any other issues/design choices which can be factored out?
