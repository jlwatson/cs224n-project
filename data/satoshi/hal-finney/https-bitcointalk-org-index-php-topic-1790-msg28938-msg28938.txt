Satoshi, are you endorsing the idea that additional block chains would each
create their own flavor of coins, which would trade with bitcoins on
exchanges? These chain-specific coins would be used to reward miners on those
chains, and to purchase some kinds of rights or privileges within the domain
of that chain?
