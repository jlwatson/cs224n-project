Why are you guys so obsessed with paying taxes in the first place ?

Because we don't want to end up in prison?  

Actually you can't go to prison for not paying your taxes (in the US at
least). There are no longer debtors' prisons. You can go to prison for not
filing accurate tax forms, but not for failing to pay. The IRS may take away
your income and possessions, you may be forced out on the street, but you will
not go to prison.
