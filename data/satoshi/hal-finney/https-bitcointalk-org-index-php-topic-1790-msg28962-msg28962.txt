OK so if there are going to be bitdnscoins (aka DCCs, DomainChain Coins) then
they have to be useful for something. Otherwise every BitDNS miner is going to
fill every block with his own domain name registrations, rather than replace
one with someone else's registration in exchange for a transaction fee in a
useless currency.  
  
The rules have to be that you have to spend a certain amount of
bitdnscoins/DCCs in order to register your names and/or do other BitDNS
transactions. That's the only way to make this alternative currency desirable
and valuable.  
  
(Well we could do like Bitcoin and say there would only ever be 22 million
DCCs ever created, so they'd get valuable from scarcity just like bitcoins.
But that seems weak.)
