According to https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_Hardware_Comparison, the 5770
draws about 100W and generates 150 Mhash/s. According to
http://www.alloscomp.com/bitcoin/calculator.php, this should generate a block
every 5 days. 5 days is 120 hours, times 100W is 12 kWh. Around here it's
$0.20 per kWh, so that's about $2.50 per block for electricity. A block of 50
bitcoins is worth about $15 now, less $2.50 is $12.50 profit. The $99 card
will be paid off after 8 blocks, so that's about 40 days at current
difficulty. After that it's pure profit.  
  
Most people assume difficulty will continue to rise, but I think it will level
off soon, because except for unusual deals like this one, GPU mining is close
to becoming unprofitable.
