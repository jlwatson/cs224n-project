My pet peeve, related to endianness, is treating hashes as numbers and
reversing them. A hash is a byte string with a well defined order and it makes
no more sense to reverse it than to reverse text.  
  
I would also have used a more common elliptic curve for the crypto, and made
some changes to speed it up.
