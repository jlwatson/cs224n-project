As I recall, the patent is very general.  A sends a message to B, B sends
one back to A; this goes on for a while, then both sides feed their messages
into a black box and, presto, out pops a suitable encryption key which is the
same for both sides, but is such that no eavesdropper could feasibly produce
the key.  It's been a long time since I looked at it, though.  I would welcome
some verification.

(I should also add that my comment about Shamir not undercutting his own
financial interests was apparently incorrect if he has actually sold out his
interest in RSA as reported.)
