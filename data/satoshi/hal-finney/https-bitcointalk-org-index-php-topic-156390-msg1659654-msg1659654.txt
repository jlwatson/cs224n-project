I actually had an account with MTB back in the day. They partnered with David
Chaum, guru of techno-privacy. Chaum had a place with Cypherpunks roughly
analogous to Satoshi's around here, except he didn't have the grace to
disappear mysteriously, and he very definitely had feet of clay.  
  
Anyway, MTB offered accounts using Chaum's blinding technology, so the bank
couldn't see whom you were paying, as long as it was another account holder. I
don't think this would fly today, but that was before KYC etc. The experiment
never really got off the ground, and it was terminated shortly after.  
  
The OP has a piece of blinded ecash suitable for transfer to another MTB
account holder, at least if you had a time machine and could go back to the
90's. They were all powers of two, hence the 128 cents.
