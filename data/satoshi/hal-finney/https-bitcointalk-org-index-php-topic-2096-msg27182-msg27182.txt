Running ./bitcoin.exe -addnode 192.168.1.48 (which is another computer running
Bitcoin) produces error: You must set rpcpassword= in the configuration
file...  
  
Same error with -connect. I don't have a bitcoin.conf.  
  
Is this right? I'm not interested in rpc, I just want to speed up initial
block download.  
  
When I create the file as required, I then get error: couldn't connect to
server.  
  
I tried telnet 192.168.1.48 8333 and did make a connection, got back the word
'version and a bunch of gibberish.
