It's possible to do purely P2P poker using cryptography to shuffle the cards.
The problem is that either all n players have to cooperate to decrypt a card,
in which case if any player leaves the hand can't be completed; or t < n
players suffice to decrypt a card, in which case any t players could collude
to learn other players' cards. But it could work for a friendly game.
