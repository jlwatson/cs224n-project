A more secure way is not to setenv PGPPASS but rather:
setenv PGPPASSFD 1
and then
(echo "vinces passphrase" ; cat mailtmp.asc) | pgp -f >> mailtmp

The PGPPASSFD means take the passphrase from file descriptor 1, which is
the standard input.  This way it never appears in the environment of a
process.  Many unix systems have a switch to ps to show all processes'
environments.
