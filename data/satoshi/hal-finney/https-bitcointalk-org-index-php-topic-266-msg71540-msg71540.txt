I used to have trouble managing payments to a service that used a new address
every time. Seems to conflict with the idea of an address book. Imagine if
everyone's phone number changed every call. Not too convenient.  
  
Here's what I do now:  
  
1\. Copy the payment address.  
2\. Choose Send Coins in the client.  
3\. Choose Address Book in the popup.  
4\. Choose New Address.  
5\. Enter a name for this payee, and paste in the Bitcoin address. Use the
same name for all payments to this payee. For example, I use MBC for all
transfers to my mybitcoin.com account.  
6\. Click OK in the New Address window.  
7\. Click OK in the Address Book window.  
8\. The Pay To field now holds the payment address. Enter the amount and click
Send.  
  
This way the transaction in your wallet will show who it's for. It does add
some extra steps though. I wish sites would give customers the option to reuse
a persistent address.
