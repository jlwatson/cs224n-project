See this analysis by [mike] looking at similar transaction loads and what that
would mean for mining servers:

Mike astutely identifies the bottleneck as the CPU power to verify transaction
signatures. I've been doing some profiling and over 90% of the CPU time of the
(non-generating) client is spent in ECDSA_verify.  
  
There are plans for lightweight clients that would not download blocks, just
headers. Then they would be sent details of transactions involving them. Only
the big iron would keep the block chain.
