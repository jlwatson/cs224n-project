I've played the Foresight Exchange play-money prediction market at
ideosphere.com since 1995. It would be great to see a Bitcoin version. The way
it works is you create a "claim", which is a prediction that might or might
not come true. Normally these have a due date for when they'll be judged. You
also name another player as the judge. The claim creator can bet on the claim
but the judge can't.  
  
Once the claim is created people can offer to buy "yes" or "no" shares at
prices ranging from 0.00 to 1.00, which can be thought of as the probability
that the claim will come true. When a pair of yes and no offering prices
match, a pair of shares are created and given to the bidders, while their
accounts of FX$ play money are decreased.  
  
At the due date the claim is judged. If it is true, owners of YES shares are
payed off at FX$1.00 per share, and if false, owners of NO shares receive
similar payoffs.  
  
It's pretty impressive that the game has gone on so long. Many of the claims
will not come due for decades into the future. I think this game could be a
good model for a real money version based on Bitcoin.
