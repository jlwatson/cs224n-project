The frequency of finding blocks is an example of the Poisson distribution.
Here is a good, simple page about it:

(no, that doesn't say star trek)  
  
Here is a calculator: http://stattrek.com/Tables/Poisson.aspx. You plug in the
number of blocks you _should_ have gotten in an interval, and the number of
blocks you actually did get (or think you might get). It will tell you the
probably to get that many blocks, or more, or less.
