The modification to repeatedly hash the 64 bit password is a good idea, and
should prevent square root attacks. I would probably have used a simpler
iterative formula, but that one seems safe enough. SHA512 is notorious for
speed variations on different architectures, but compared to the time to type
in the password, that should be ok. Where does the magic number 108333 come
from?
