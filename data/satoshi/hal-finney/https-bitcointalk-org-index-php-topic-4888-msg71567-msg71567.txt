Warning, lots of bad information and wrong answers in this thread!  
  
Addresses are not created in batches of 100 (after initialization), they are
created one at a time as they are used, so you always have a pool of 100
unused addresses.  
  
Wallets do hold transactions, all the ones you see in the client window.  
  
You would probably not want to share the same wallet between your home system
and your phone, because of the risk of theft, any more than you would empty
your bank account and carry all your money around with you as cash. Most
people plan to hold a fraction of their assets in their phones.
