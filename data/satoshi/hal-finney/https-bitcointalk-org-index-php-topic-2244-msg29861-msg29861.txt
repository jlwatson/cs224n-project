As a relative newbie to the code, I do find your version easier to read. It's
easier to find the implementations of functions since most are class members
and are now in named .cpp files. It's also nice to have the full class
implementation in one place rather than having to flip back and forth between
.h and .cpp files.  
  
However that is for reading, and the needs of developers may be somewhat
different. Obviously Satoshi knows the current layout intimately, and as the
main developer it is up to him to see whether he could work with the new
layout.  
  
One concern I'd have with losing the inlinable .h functions is whether it
could slow down either initial block load/verify/indexing, or mining (a bit
moot with gpu miners these days).
