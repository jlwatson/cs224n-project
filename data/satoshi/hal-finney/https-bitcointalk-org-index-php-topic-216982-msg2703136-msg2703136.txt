  
The zerocoin part does more than defend against DOS, doesn't it? It also
provides a degree of anyonymity, if I understand it. In the conventional
multi-party anti-taint protocol, every participant knows the mapping from
inputs to outputs. But in your improved protocol using libzerocoin, nobody
sees the mapping. Now, this requires more than two participants, so
considerable organization is needed to coordinate.  
  
Still, this an application of the zerocoin protocol which doesn't have an
impact on the blockchain. OTOH, it has a small anonymity set, so the benefit
is rather modest.
