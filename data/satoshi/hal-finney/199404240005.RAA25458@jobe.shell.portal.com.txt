Try chaining the message through multiple remailers, then to a bitbucket
address.  One such address is "nobody@soda.berkeley.edu".  Presumably there
are many of this type.


Send yourself an encrypted message, chaining through a bunch of remailers.

See the cypherpunks ftp archive on soda.berkeley.edu for scripts
which will let you do these things.
