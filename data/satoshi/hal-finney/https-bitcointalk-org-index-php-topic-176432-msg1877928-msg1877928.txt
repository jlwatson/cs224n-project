I aquired most of my coins by mining. This has no anology with currency
(unless you're counterfeiting  ) so I intend to treat bitcoins as precious
metals and declare my profits as capital gains. Since I mined them more than a
year earlier, they are long term capital gains. This is not as favorable as
usual because it turns out that precious metals, even bullion, are considered
"collectables" and taxed at a rate of 28%. Normal rate is 15%. If your overall
tax rate is less than 28%, you can pay the lower rate. That is what I intend
to do, based on my reading of the IRS documents.
