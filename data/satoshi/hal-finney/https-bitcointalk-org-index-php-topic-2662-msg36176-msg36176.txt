In addition to documenting the on-the-wire protocol, I think we should
document the rules a peer should follow. Some rules are for behaving
cooperatively, such as participating in the flood-based broadcasting. Others
are for using the network safely, how and when to validate incoming blocks and
other data. I think you have some of this in the original wiki page RHorning,
but I'm not sure it has all propagated to the new wiki.
