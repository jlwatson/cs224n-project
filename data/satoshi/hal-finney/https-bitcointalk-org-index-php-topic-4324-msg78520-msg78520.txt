I added a step to the wiki:  
  
# Recheck blockexplorer to make sure the address still shows the right amount,
in case the block chain reorganizes  
  
Checking the address balance once, then waiting for more blocks, is not safe
by itself as the transaction may go away.  
  
(Just realized my solution is still vulnerable: the transaction could pay you,
go away, you wait n blocks, and a different transaction pays you, you recheck
the balance and it looks good, but then the 2nd transaction goes away.)
