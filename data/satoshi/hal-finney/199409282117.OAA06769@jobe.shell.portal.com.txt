Just browsing www.digicash.com, I see a relatively new web page with some
info on various employees.  They also mentioned that there is a U.S. office,

        DigiCash Inc
        701 Welch Road, Suite 323
        Palo Alto, CA 94304
        USA
        tel +1-415 321 0300
        fax +1-415 321 0322

Bay area CP's might want to check this out (unless it is already common
knowledge).

(I notice Chaum has his own picture and initials on the DigiCash coins
in the graphics!)
