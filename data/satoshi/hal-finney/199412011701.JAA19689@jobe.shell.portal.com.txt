We have had some discussion on the topic of new countries here so I
thought I would forward this short note.  I haven't looked at the web
page yet.  Apologies if you've seen it already.

A new web site has opened containing files related to the new country
in development, Oceania.  You may get the Constitution and Laws, plus
information on related books such as The Atlantis Papers and The
Millennial Project.  You may also view true color pictures of Oceania
plus view back issues of the Oceania Oracle.  Animations of Oceania
are also online as well as information on how to receive an Oceania
passport.

The web is located at http://unicycle.cs.tulane.edu/oceania
