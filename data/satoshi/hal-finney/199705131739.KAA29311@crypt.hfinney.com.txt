Coderpunks has not been very active, I think (although I don't always
notice which messages come from which lists).  Perry Metzger's moderated
cryptography@c2.net has had some good discussions lately, including
contributions from such people as Carl Ellison and Matt Blaze.  There
was an interesting proposal from James Donald for a possible approach
to what they are calling CACK, "Corporate Access to Corporate Keys",
without facilitating GAK, "Government Access to Keys".

The cypherpunks list continues to have the edge in political commentary
and bomb-making instructions. :-)
