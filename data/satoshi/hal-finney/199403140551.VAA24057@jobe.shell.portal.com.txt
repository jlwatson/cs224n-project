The Caltech system had some problems with break-ins so apparently some
disk reorganization was done in the clean-up which stopped my remailer
for a while.  I touched up a bit of the code tonight, nothing too
significant, and it seems to be working OK now.

Note that this remailer always forwards via the one at shell.portal.com.
It does have its own decryption key, but all outgoing mail goes via that
address.  This makes the mailer more politically acceptable to TPTB.  But
it does mean that when you "ping" the remailer you won't see the alumni
address in the From line, but portal instead.
