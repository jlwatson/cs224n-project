Netscape:




This relates to the other part of my question, which didn't get answered:
what is the relationship between the name found in the X.509 certificate
and the server?  Does X.509 include an internet address like mcom.com,
and the Netscape client checks that this matches the address of the
server it is connecting to?  I am not very familiar with the certificate
format but I had the impression that it used a very different naming
scheme.

Or does the client accept any valid certificate without regard to the
connection if any between the name in the certificate and the server to
which it is connected?  This whole area was left undefined in the SSL
spec but will be important for interoperability.
