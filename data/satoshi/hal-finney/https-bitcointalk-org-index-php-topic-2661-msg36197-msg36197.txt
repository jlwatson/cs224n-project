Let me unpack this idea into parts.  
  
1\. Sharing your compute power in a massively parallel effort that has some
value.  
  
2\. Doing this specifically with GPU.  
  
3\. Getting paid for it.  
  
4\. Getting paid specifically with bitcoins.  
  
#1 is widely done, eg Folding@Home to improve biological models. There are a
ton of these. For #2, I imagine that some do use GPUs, as people are very
competitive. #3 is hard. If you're getting paid, someone is paying, so we are
mostly looking at commercial applications. But these tend to be sensitive or
secret, not suitable for wide sharing. For example, an obvious application
would be rendering graphics for a new movie. But the producers wouldn't want
their scenes to be leaked.  
  
To solve these problems and then focus only on people who want to receive
bitcoins would be doubly difficult.
