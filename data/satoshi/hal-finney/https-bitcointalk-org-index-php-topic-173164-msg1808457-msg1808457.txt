I used to have one of these. In fact, I hacked a version of PGP to look for
your private key on the ring, so you could sign or decrypt just by touching
the ring to the reader. (Actually you had to kind of snap it in.) Since PGP
already used the "key ring" terminology, I thought it was particularly
apropos. Too bad they never caught on, although it would bring on the dreaded
"stolen finger" attack.
