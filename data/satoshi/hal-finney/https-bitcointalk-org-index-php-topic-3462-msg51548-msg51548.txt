Bitcoin addresses are 160-bit hashes of keys which have 256 bits of
uniqueness. We could switch to a 256-bit hash pretty easily (or even not use a
hash, just use the 256-bit x coordinate of the public key). The scriptPubkey
could use OP_HASH256 instead of OP_HASH160 to reduce the risk of collisions.
Addresses would be a few characters longer.
