Well how do you know if youve successfully resolved a block ? Been mining for
almost a week with 400KH/s but still nothing in my client Bitcoin client @.@  

Plug your hash rate into the Bitcoin Calculator to see how often you can
expect to find a block. 400 kh/s will take over two years. That's if
difficulty doesn't go up.
