You Bay Area people probably know all about this already, but I was
browsing through the local bookstore yesterday and saw Eric Hughes,
Cypherpunks co-founder, on the cover of the "Cyberpunk [sic] Handbook",
a slim satirical volume by the Mondo 2000 people.  The book has more
attitude than information, though.
