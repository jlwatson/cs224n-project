  
I'm not sure how it would work to only create one coin per block. Would this
only buy the creation of one domain name?  
  
The reason I like the idea of fractional coins is it would give more
flexibility in transaction fees. If it costs one coin to register a domain, it
might make sense that a good size for the transaction fee would be fractional.
