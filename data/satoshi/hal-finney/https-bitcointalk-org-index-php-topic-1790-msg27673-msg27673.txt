Well before starting coding, let's make sure we have the protocol clearly
written out. For instance, are we going to take my suggestion of using
unitary, non-fractional, bitdnscoins where 1 block == 1 bitdnscoin, instead of
having the number of bitdnscoins per block start at 50 and half every few
years? Also, there is no need for fractional bitdnscoins since it doesn't make
too much sense to own one-tenth of a domain name. Keep in mind that people can
use fiat money or even bitcoins when trading unitary bitdnscoins, incase they
need to make a trade of two domain names with unequal subjective valuations.  

  
I'm not sure how it would work to only create one coin per block. Would this
only buy the creation of one domain name?  
  
The reason I like the idea of fractional coins is it would give more
flexibility in transaction fees. If it costs one coin to register a domain, it
might make sense that a good size for the transaction fee would be fractional.
