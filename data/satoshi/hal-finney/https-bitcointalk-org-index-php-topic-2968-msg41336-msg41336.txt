Interesting analysis! Don't forget that in several years, if Bitcoin succeeds,
there will be orders of magnitude more transactions. And some of these will be
able to pay substantial fees. So there will be a strategy to start generating
right away, beat the miners who are waiting, and collect these high value tx
fees.  
  
Also, currently miners don't update the block they're working on with new
transactions as they come in. I think that makes the hash search more
efficient. So by the time a block is generated, there's already a substantial
pool of new transactions to start working on. This too may change in the
future though.
