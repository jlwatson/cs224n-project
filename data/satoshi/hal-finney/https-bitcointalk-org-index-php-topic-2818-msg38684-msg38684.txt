Good question - here's the answer

Thank you for satisfying my curiosity. I think it's almost certain that such
an early block would have been generated by Satoshi. Of course, "spent" is
quite a strong term. The coins might just have been sent to a different
wallet.  

This was actually a test payment Satoshi sent to me during debugging. I see in
my email logs I offered to send it back but it seems I didn't.  It was an IP-
address based payment.
