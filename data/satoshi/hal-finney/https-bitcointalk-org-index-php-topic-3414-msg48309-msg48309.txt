I agree that Satoshi's "200 bytes for backward compatibility" is something of
a mystery. The 200 is probably a clue. It is quite a bit bigger than a Bitcoin
block header. Might be about the size of a block header plus a dummy
transaction.  
  
There are still some ways to embed arbitrary data in Bitcoin transactions.
AFAIK scriptSig data is not checked, and you could put anything at the front
without invalidating any signatures. So a BitDNS hash could be stuck into the
current Bitcoin block.
