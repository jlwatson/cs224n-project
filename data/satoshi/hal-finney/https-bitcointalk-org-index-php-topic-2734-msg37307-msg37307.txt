It's pretty strange really that we all see a good chance that bitcoins will
hit a dollar in the relatively near future. How many investments can be
expected to triple in value in that time frame? Is gold going to be $3500 any
time soon? Apple stock going to triple? Maybe Facebook, if you could get some.
That seems like a pretty sure thing.  
  
We are really lucky to be in at the beginning of a possibly explosive new
phenomenon. Considering the odds against most money-tripling investments,
Bitcoin looks like a good place for a percentage of your portfolio.
