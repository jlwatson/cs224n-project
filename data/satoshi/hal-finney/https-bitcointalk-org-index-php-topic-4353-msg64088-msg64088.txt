This was on the development roadmap,
http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4170.msg60385  
"design/implement a secure DNS-like "map string to bitcoin address" system (so
I can send bitcoins to "gavin@acm.org")"  

I had the impression the roadmap called for a BitDNS-like decentralized
mapping system, since Gavin asked to map "strings" to addresses. Maybe I
misunderstood.
