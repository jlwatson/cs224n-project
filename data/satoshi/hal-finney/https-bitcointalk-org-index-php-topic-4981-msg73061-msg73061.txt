Consider a world where mining only pays out transaction fees. Almost all
miners charge a transaction fee of t and all users pay a transaction fee of t
on their transactions.  
  
One miner decides to increase his profits by charging a smaller transaction
fee. He publicly announces his intention and many users reduce their fee to be
on par with the new fee he has announced.

If I post a transaction with a fee that would be accepted by only one miner, I
will have to wait much longer for my transaction to get into a block. If he
controlled 1% of the mining power, I'd have to wait for 100 blocks on average.
That may not be attractive to many users.
