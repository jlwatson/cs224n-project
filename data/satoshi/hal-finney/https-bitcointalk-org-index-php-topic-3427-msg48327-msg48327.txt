I think this is a great idea Joe. There have been many, many, many requests
for this functionality. The recent addition of the rescan feature will help.
When you import the key, do a rescan to pick up the transaction that funds it.
Then pay yourself. People want this for backups too.  
  
I don't think you need to remove the key from the sender's wallet, it will
still notice when it's spent. OTOH might be a good idea to remove it,
otherwise you might accidentally spend it before the recipient inputs it.
