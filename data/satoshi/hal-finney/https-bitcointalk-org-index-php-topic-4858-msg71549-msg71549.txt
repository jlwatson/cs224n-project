Adding a check for a sufficiently low probability event means that the
overwhelming majority of the time, the CPU or memory glitched, and it is a
false alarm.  
  
Adding checks for address hash collisions with existing addresses would not
protect you against the creation of an address in the future whose hash
collides with yours.  
  
If you ever did generate an address whose hash collided with an existing
address, you could steal any bitcoins held by that address. So you might not
want to throw this windfall away.
