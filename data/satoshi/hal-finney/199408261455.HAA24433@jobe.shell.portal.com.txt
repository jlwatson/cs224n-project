I've been receiving these, too.  It seems to be a program which has the
same effect as a one-line shell script to add the "+legal_kludge" option
to the command line for PGP2.6, so that it generates backwards-compatible
messages without violating anyone's license agreements.  It's easy to
do such a shell script in Unix.  Is there a good way in DOS to add a few
command-line arguments in front of the ones the user has supplied?  If
so that would seem easier (and smaller) to distribute.
