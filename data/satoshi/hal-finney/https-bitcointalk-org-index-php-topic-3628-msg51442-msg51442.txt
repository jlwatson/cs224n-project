Why are so many Russians dishonest? Is it because of all those years of
communism, a system built on lies? Or does it go deeper in the Russian
culture? Are Russian children even taught by their parents not to lie? Are
they taught sayings like "honesty is the best policy", and stories like George
Washington and the cherry tree?
