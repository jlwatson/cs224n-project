I could see this would come up in Jim's description.  Who exactly are these
"empowered users"?  And how much security do the second-class citizens ac-
tually get?  Will it work for everyone to become "empowered", or are there
scaling problems in terms of bandwidth?

It seems to me that the most sensible approach is to make message fragmen-
tation into standard-sized packets, along with reassembly, be at the
end user site.  This way everyone becomes a first-class citizen.
