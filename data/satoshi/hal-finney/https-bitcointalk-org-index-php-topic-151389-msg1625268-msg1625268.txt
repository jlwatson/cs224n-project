I made an order from BitcoinStore, a high end HP laptop for my research into
strengthening Bitcoin wallets with Trusted Computing. It was about $1000.
Unfortunately the site crashed for several hours just after I sent my bitcoins
in but before I could complete the order. I contacted customer service after
the site came up, and they were very helpful. They entered my order manually,
and I got an email that the order had been received. I didn't get any further
response, however. I waited a week and emailed cs again. They were very
apologetic and assured me they'd take care of it. To my surprise, the next
morning I got a delivery and it was the laptop! It's working great.  
  
So the store has some growing pains but customer service will take care of
you. My one disappointment was that the package came from MemoryDealers and
not BitcoinStore. That would have been cool.
