Unfortunately the main alternative to SSL being pushed now, SHTTP, also
suffers from RSA-itis.  It will support either PEM or PKCS-7 key
certificates, so I think ends up being pretty much the same as SSL in
this regard.

Note though that neither SSL or SHTTP requires that the certificates come
from RSA.  However the current versions of Netscape's browser do require this.
This has been the source of much complaint and Netscape has promised that
they will have some mechanism in the future to allow the user to
choose his certificate signers.  I am not sure how far RSA will let them
off the leash, though.

The current version of SSL supports client authentication (via X.500
certificates of course).

I'm not sure what this is getting at.  SSL does use a separate RC4 stream
for each comm half.  Is this a suggestion that a single key should be
used for both directions?  There are two ways that could be done: keep
separate state info for each direction, in which case you are encrypting
data twice with the same pseudo-random string, a definite no-no; or try
to keep a single global state for the cipher, but this is impossible due
to the (potentially) asynchronous nature of the communications.

Back to Perry:


That is why I am working on the proxy approach.  Any browser should be
able to use enhancements supplied in this way.  Netscape is the big name
this year, who knows who it will be next year.  As long as IP
connectivity is available a proxy can get into the stream and apply
enhancements.
