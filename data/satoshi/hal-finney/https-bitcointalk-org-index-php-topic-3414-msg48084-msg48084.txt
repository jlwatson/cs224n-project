The idea of a Merkle tree is you just store the root, and then when someone
wants to convince you that something's in the tree, they produce the Merkle
branch. The Merkle roots are in the block headers. Merkle branches are stored
with transactions in wallets. So when you do a spend, in principle you can
prove that your "in" transactions are legit, by providing the Merkle branches
for all of them. However there are no data structures defined at this time for
sending such information in the network.  
  
Now this is not a matter of removing spent transactions; rather, it's a mode
of operation that would allow nodes to forget all transactions, spent and
unspent, and just keep block headers.
