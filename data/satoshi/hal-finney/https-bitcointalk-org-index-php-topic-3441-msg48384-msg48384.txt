Suppose the attacker is generating blocks occasionally. in each block he
generates, he includes a transfer from address A to address B, both of which
he controls.  
  
To cheat you, when he generates a block, he doesn't broadcast it. Instead, he
runs down to your store and makes a payment to your address C with his address
A. You wait a few seconds, don't hear anything, and transfer the goods. He
broadcasts his block now, and his transaction will take precedence over yours.
