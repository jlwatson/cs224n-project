I never saw the posting below here, only on sci.crypt.  It seems
relevant to the present discussion.

I did take a look at the source code to stealth pgp; it is quite simple and
nicely done.  However it doesn't do anything special about disguising the
encrypted session key.  It just strips off the two length bytes PGP puts
at the front.  Not only is this revealing, it also doesn't always work.
Apparently the program can't always reconstruct the original mpi length
if the encrypted key's size happens to be much less than the modulus.
It does print a warning in that case that the file won't be able to be
de-stealth'd successfully.

Stealth PGP is a nice start but it needs to be improved to be truly stealthy.
