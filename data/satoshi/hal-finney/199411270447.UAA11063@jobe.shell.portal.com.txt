http://northpole.net is Santa's home page.  For your kids you can order
buttons saying "I emailed Santa", at $5 per.  Afraid to send your VISA
card number across the net?  No problem - they use PGP.  Key available
by mail to button-info@shop.net, orders to buttons@shop.net.

(I have no connection to this business - but it's nice to imagine a
bunch of kids pestering Dad to get PGP so he can order them a button!)


P.S. Here's the key.
