Would there be interest in a network based on a GPU-resistant problem, instead
of SHA-256? Then everyone could be a miner again.  
  
(I know what you're thinking: like what problem, exactly? Well I don't know
GPU architecture, but I imagine such problems exist. Maybe some of the memory
based problems in http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system)
