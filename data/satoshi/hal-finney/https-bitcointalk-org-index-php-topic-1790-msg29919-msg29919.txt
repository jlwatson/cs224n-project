I wonder if it would work to put a (possibly salted?) hash of the name into
the block rather than the name itself? Then it would not be obvious what name
is being registered, but you could still lookup registrations by name. This
would not be perfectly secure, short names could be found from hashes by brute
force, but it would make front-running much harder.
