This is true, but the main purpose of this technology is to prevent users
from creating large numbers of pseudonymous accounts.  No technology can
stop people from cooperating in an on-line forum, and the use of friends'
or family members' accounts is also very hard to prevent.  So collusion at
some limited level will always be possible.  But at least it should be
possible to prevent the massive use of nyms.
