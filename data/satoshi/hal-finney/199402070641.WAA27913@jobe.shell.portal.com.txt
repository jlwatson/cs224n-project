From Pr0duct Cypher:


I think it's great that you are able to fix these things so quickly.
It's natural that there will be a lot of shaking out in any initial
release.


Knuth has some discussion of this in Seminumerical Algorithms.  The term
for numbers which have only small factors is that they are "smooth".  He
has some formulas for what fraction of numbers are smooth based on the
size of the largest allowed prime and the size of the numbers.  Unfortunately
I won't have access to my copy until Tuesday.  Perhaps someone else can
look it up.


Clever idea.  If only it wouldn't be so slow.


The 8192 cutoff might work.  We would have to check it out, but it
could be that finding 1024-bit numbers in a relatively narrow range of
+/- 2^64 which are composed solely of factors in the range, say, 8192
to 16384 would be infeasible.  I don't recall whether Knuth considers the
problem in this form.  This would be a great save if it works.
