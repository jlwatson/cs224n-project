PGP could be hacked fairly easily to do this (in fact there is a
program around called stealth that does this to some extent), however
in the context of this discussion we were discussing more the issue of
checking the signature on a file.  For that we do need a hint about
whose signature purports to be there.  PGP presently provides this in
the form of the low-order 64 bits of the key modulus, and this provides
problems in implementing the key database in distributed form.
