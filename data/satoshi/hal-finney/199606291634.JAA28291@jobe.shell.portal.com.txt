Since the PGP is run on private computers, and only at mail-reading time,
there should be no problem entering the conventional encryption
passphrase and checking to see whether the messages decrypt.  Actually
PGP puts a pattern at the beginning of the encrypted portion, so
successful decryption can be checked very quickly, without much of a
computational load.
