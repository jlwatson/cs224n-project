Another thing to keep in mind is that, probably, two years from now
a considerable majority of people on the net will be people who aren't
using it yet.  They won't have twenty years of experience with ASCII
and Unix and /bin/mail, etc.  As Lucky Green says, they will get going
with Mosaic or derivatives and never leave it.  They will use Internet
in a Box (or an equivalent from AOL or Microsoft) and get set up and
running easily.  They won't have to use Archie to find a JPEG or GIF
viewer, it will be built in.  Most of them will use a PC running
Windows 95, a few will use Macs.  That will be the net in two years,
IMO.

We should be ready for that world and working to keep it safe for
privacy.  As Phil Z. said in the PGP docs, "skate to where the puck will
be."  We need to look forward, not look back to the good old days.
