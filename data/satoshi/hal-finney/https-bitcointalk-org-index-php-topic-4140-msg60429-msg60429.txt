Bitcoin's behind-the-scenes address handling makes things a little
complicated. Say you received 2 payments of 50 to your empty wallet. Then you
made 2 payments of 30. Now you will have 2 addresses worth 20, both addresses
you've never seen before and which don't show up in the transaction list.
These received the "change" from the 30 payments.  
  
These addresses don't reveal which 50 payment they came from. To see that
you'd have to provide some new mechanisms. Maybe show the transaction history
behind each address. Maybe show change addresses in the main window. Maybe
bring in the account features and tag transactions with accounts.  
  
It's not as simple/useful as it seems.
