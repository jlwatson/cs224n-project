Whats the general plan here? No reduction in names/block I assume? Won't this
make the first blocks incredible valuable and later blocks less valuable as
the goodness of remaining names declines? Maybe it should start really low
(1?) and move up gradually to a stable amount (100?)?  

  
Good point, I'm going to quote this in the BitDNS thread, hope you don't mind.
