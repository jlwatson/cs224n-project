bitcoin-qt tries to randomize the position of the change output, but I believe
the code has a flaw:  
  
// Insert change txn at random position:  
vector<CTxOut>::iterator position =
wtxNew.vout.begin()+GetRandInt(wtxNew.vout.size());  
wtxNew.vout.insert(position, CTxOut(nChange, scriptChange));  
  
The problem is that size() is one in the common case of one payee, so
GetRandInt will always return 0.The change ends up in the first output.  
  
I think it should be size()+1.
