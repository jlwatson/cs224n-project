Also, Bitcoin clients will not recognize non-standard transactions. If you
send one of these transactions to someone not using a modified client, they
will just ignore it.  

Thanks for the comments. To clarify, do you mean that transactions with
OP_PUSHDATA and OP_DROP, etc would be rejected by current clients?
