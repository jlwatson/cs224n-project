I will agree that there are alternatives to certificates.  I alluded to
this in the part of my message which you elided below, about defeating
MITM attacks via various techniques.  However, it may not be as easy to
automate these tests as to automate a certificate check, and in
particular the more automated the tests become the more plausible it
would be that the MITM could recognize and defeat a standard test.



The POV I am really arguing against is the one that defines identity to
be a key, that states that in communicating with a key you are by
definition communicating with the person you have in mind.  The man in
the middle attack does not exist because from your point of view the
entity at the other end of the communication channel is just the MITM
plus the person you think you are talking to.  This idea has been
expressed many times by other people in this discussion, and it is this
which I think is fundamentally flawed and even dangerous because it
encourages the use of untested keys.  In fact it seems to define away
the question of whether a key is real or fake.
