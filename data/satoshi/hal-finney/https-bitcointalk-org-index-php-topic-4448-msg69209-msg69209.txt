Simply by adding reserve keys (which are in fact harder to filter out when
exporting, since they are available in mapKeys like change keys and used
keys), you have everything to have a bitkeys file function as a backup or by
limiting its contents, as an interchange format.  

There's other stuff in wallets, including preferences, address book entries
for payees, and account information. bitkeys format won't be suitable for
wallet backup if it loses all this.
