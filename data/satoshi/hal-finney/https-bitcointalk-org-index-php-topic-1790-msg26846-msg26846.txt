Let me clarify how I understand the BitDNS idea. First, I think it is somewhat
misnamed, as we would not propose to replace the entire decentralized DNS
infrastructure of A records, CNAMEs, TTL values, etc. What we want to change
is the registrar function, which keeps track of who owns each name.  
  
A domain name entry in this system has 3 parts:  
  
\- the name itself (e.g. example.bitdns)  
\- a hash of the owning public key (e.g. djiusjfkrhffhdehyormavtrr...)  
\- the IP address of the authoritative DNS server for the name (e.g. 1.2.3.4)  
  
When you generate a block you get to create 50 of these entries, and you then
own those 50 names. Of course they have to be new names that were not in
earlier blocks.  
  
Subsequently a name might have two things happen to it:  
\- the IP address of the DNS server might change  
\- it might be transferred to a new owner  
  
Both of these might be handled the same way, via a BitDNS transaction. The
transaction would contain:  
\- the domain name  
\- the new owner key hash  
\- the new IP address of the DNS server  
And it would be signed by the old owner private key.  
  
As with Bitcoin, transactions would be broadcast and incorporated into the
next block by miners.  
  
Is this what people have in mind?
