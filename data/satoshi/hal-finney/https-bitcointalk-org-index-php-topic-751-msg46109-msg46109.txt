People talk about moving keys/addresses, but also it is important to move the
transactions. Bitcoin is a transaction based system. Your keys authorize
(sign) payments, but the payments actually come from the transactions you have
received and which are in your wallet. If you're splitting off some keys into
another wallet, you need to move the transactions that fund those keys, or
they won't be able to do anything. (Should move address book and account
entries too.)
