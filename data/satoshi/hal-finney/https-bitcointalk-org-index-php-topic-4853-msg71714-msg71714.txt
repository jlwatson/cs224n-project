Looking at the getwork code, it should only call CreateNewBlock() every minute
or so:  

Code:

if (pindexPrev != pindexBest ||  
(nTransactionsUpdated != nTransactionsUpdatedLast && GetTime() - nStart > 60))  
{  
[...]  
nTransactionsUpdatedLast = nTransactionsUpdated;  
pindexPrev = pindexBest;  
nStart = GetTime();  
  
// Create new block  
pblock = CreateNewBlock(reservekey);  

This will call CreateNewBlock() either on a new block coming in, or on a new
transaction if it's been 60 seconds since the last call. This shouldn't affect
every getwork call, unless it's actually taking 60 seconds to do
CreateNewBlock(), which would be remarkable.
