I see why everyone's so confused about what I'm trying to discuss. I just
realized the nVersion parameter to Serialize, GetSerialSize, and Unserialize
is tied to the VERSION macro, and is basically a constant.  

This is not quite right, but the code is pretty spread out. Generally
un/serialization is done by the operator<< and operator>> methods of
CDataStream in serialize.h. We do CTransaction tx; vRecv >> tx; to read a
transaction object; or vSend << a1; to send something of template class a1 (in
PushMessage in net.h).  
  
The << and >> methods in CDataStream call Serialize() or Unserialize(), which
do default the nVersion parameter to VERSION. But in these calls the default
is not used, they pass the nVersion instance variable of CDataStream. And this
instance variable is set to the min of the node and peer version, e.g. in the
code I showed above.
