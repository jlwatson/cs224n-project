It's very frustrating to have to speculate so much due to the lack of
information.  Imagine how we would react if Cybercash or Netscape had
gone forward with what they claimed were secure protocols but had
refused to publish them, referring simply to old papers on RSA and
DES.  Yet Digicash gets away with this.

We presume it works basically like this, but there could be elaborations.
In particular, I have heard (from people who claim to know) that the
payee is normally embedded into the coin at spending time.



Doing this would require the payee to be known at withdrawal time, which
is not apparently how it works.  I would speculate that actually what
happens is that the "basic coin" as above is encrypted, along with the
payee identity, all under the public key of the bank.  This was the
identity could not be stripped out by the payee or by a thief who snooped
the transmission.
