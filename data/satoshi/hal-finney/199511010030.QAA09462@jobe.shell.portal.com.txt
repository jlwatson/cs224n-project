It is also worth noting that the ITAR violation is worded somewhat
differently from some laws, requiring "willful" violation, a "specific
intent" to break the law.  In this situation, good faith efforts to apply
with what the law appears to be would seem to me to be a strong defense.

I did on this a couple of years ago.  An excerpt, from U.S. v
Lizarraga-Lizarraga (541 F2d 826):

"Accordingly, we hold that in order for a defendant to be found guilty of
exporting under 22 U.S.C. 1934, the government must prove that the
defendant voluntarily and intentionally violated a known legal duty not
to export the proscribed articles, and the jury should be so instructed."

I am not a lawyer, however.  It would be interesting to hear what our
legal exports think of this argument.
