It is also worth noting that the ITAR violation is worded somewhat
differently from some laws, requiring "willful" violation, a "specific
intent" to break the law.  In this situation, good faith efforts to apply
with what the law appears to be would seem to me to be a strong defense.
See for a writeup I did on this a couple of years ago.

I am not a lawyer, however.  It would be interesting to hear what our
legal exports think of this argument.
