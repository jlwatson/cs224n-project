I did "Copy to Clipboard" of my Bitcoin address and then hit Pay, paid myself
20 btc. Is this supposed to work?  
  
It sort of worked and sort of didn't. The transaction displays as "Payment to
yourself" with Debit -20.00 and Credit +20.00. But Status is stuck at
"0/offline?". I'm online and I've never had a problem sending a transaction
before.
