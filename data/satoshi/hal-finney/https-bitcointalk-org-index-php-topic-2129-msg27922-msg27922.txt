jgarzik makes a good argument that the complexity of the scripting system is
not being used and is unnecessary. Simple in/out transactions are all that are
needed. I'm not convinced that there is anything that can be done with Bitcoin
scripting that can't be done with a crypto layer on top of Bitcoin to
share/split keys, etc.  
  
Anyway fancy scripts won't be able to be used until everyone upgrades their
clients, after this last change. All the future-proofing that the scripting
was meant to enable is lost. So there's even less reason to keep it.
