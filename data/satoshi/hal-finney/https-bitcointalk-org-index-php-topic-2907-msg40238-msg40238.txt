I really like the style. The intro is funny and ironic, as though you have to
explain this thing called money and why you might want some. The reader is in
on the joke, and this invites him in and makes him receptive. I wouldn't
change the informal tone.  
  
I can't judge the second part because I know Bitcoin too well. You need
feedback from people who've never heard of it.
