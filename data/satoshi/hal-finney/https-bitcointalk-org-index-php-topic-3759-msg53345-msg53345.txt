I don't think it's happening here, but I had something similar happen when I
paid myself.  
  
Suppose you have a wallet funded only with one 15.87 btc transaction, and you
pay yourself (ie one of your wallet addresses) 10. Then you will have two
funded addresses in your wallet, the 10 you paid, and one with 5.87 for
change. Now suppose you pay someone else 10. You'd think it would just use the
10 btc address as input. But it won't.  
  
The client will choose both the 10 and 5.87 addresses as input, and have two
outputs, 10 btc to the address you are paying, and 5.87 back to you as change.
The reason is the client's coin-choosing algorithm is transaction based. If
you have transaction where both outputs go to you, as when you pay yourself,
then if the client payscwith that transaction, it will always use both
addresses.  
  
So this is a way you can get transactions like what you saw, with two inputs
and two outputs, and values that match.
