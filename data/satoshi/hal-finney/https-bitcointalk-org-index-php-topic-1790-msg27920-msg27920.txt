What if the consensus is that the Bitcoin network should not be used to
support DNS (as I expect)? Then the only alternative is to go forward with a
parallel but independent block chain, creating a second currency. Are we ok
with that?  
  
I have a couple questions about
http://privwiki.dreamhosters.com/wiki/Bitcoin_DNS_System_Proposal  
  
When you register a name, there is a fee to a DNS server. In the doc, this
appears like a Bitcoin transaction fee. The first example shows 10.01 input
and 0.01 output, so the 10.00 difference would be a transaction fee. But tx
fees go to miners. Is it assumed that miners are the same as DNS servers? Or
would there be a 2nd output, a fee to a particular DNS server to get it to
register you, in addition to a tx fee to the miner?  
  
Are you allowing name changes of the main part of the domain? Like
elephantfood.bitdns can change to dogfood.bitdns (if it is available)? Or is
this disallowed, in which case, exactly which kinds of name changes are
allowed?  
  
Would anyone who wants be able to run one of these special DNS servers, or do
you envision there being relatively few of these?  
  
Thanks -
