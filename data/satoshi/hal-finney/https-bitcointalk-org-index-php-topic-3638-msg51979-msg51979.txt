Sorry! I did screw up the encoding. Here is the 256-bit private key in big-
endian hex:  
  
C85AFBACCF3E1EE40BDCD721A9AD1341344775D51840EFC0511E0182AE92F78E  
  
My new attempt to base58 encode this is:  
  
EV71KQfoePBeWT79sV1VE7fWRgv1KNUxTNapH6ZbaRfB  
  
That's custom code, maybe somebody could check it.  
  
To apologize, I've added 30 BTC to the address. We're now at block 109352.  
  
The reason I did it this way is that it would be a good format for passing
around or backing up bitcoins.  
  
BTW the new version of Bitcoin has a -rescan switch to find all txns that are
for wallet keys. Only takes a couple minutes.
