do i have to run the ssl server to use it locally?  

The js-remote script implements a ssl web server, fully self contained. You
don't need apache. Just run SSLserver.py, open up port 8338 for incoming, and
connect with your mobile browser to https://yourhost.com:8338. Then you can
access your wallet from anywhere, check balance, make payments, etc.
