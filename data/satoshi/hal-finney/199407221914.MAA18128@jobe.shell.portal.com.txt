This seems like a good approach for a lot of cases.  You end up having
three classes of transactions: small, medium, and large, with slightly
different strategies for each.  For large, you do on-line checking; for
medium, you detect double-spending after the fact and use crypto to find
his identity; and for small you set up an account and dip into that a bit
at a time.  I am curious about whether you are focussing more on some size range
in your plans.

One problem I still see is the small transaction where you don't tend to
use the same provider again and again.  On the net there are a few sites
(well, quite a few, I suppose) which are heavily used, but there are a
lot of places I might like to just browse through.  Paying a penny per
site isn't going to bother me much, but if I have to set up an account
for each one ahead of time I'm probably not going to bother.  So I still
think there are problems with the fractional-cent-per-web-site model
which I have been hearing about.


Is this an approach where you determine to whom you will be sending the cash,
then make it into a "check" which can only be spent by that recipient?
Doesn't that require the bank's (cash issuer's) help?  Or is this something
else?
