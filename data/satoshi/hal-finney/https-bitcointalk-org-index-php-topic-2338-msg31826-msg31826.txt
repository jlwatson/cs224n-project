I'd predict that difficulty will stop rising once it becomes impossible to
mine at a profit. Based on ribuck's figures, we're pretty much there if you
account for GPU prices, and maybe a factor of 4 away even for people who only
count electricity (because they use their cards for gaming etc). So unless the
price of bitcoins rises, I expect difficulty to start leveling off soon.
