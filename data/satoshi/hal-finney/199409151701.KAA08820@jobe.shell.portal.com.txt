I realized a few minutes later that I was mistaken to write:


Just knowing several of the first few entries in the table doesn't allow
you to quickly reject keys because the algorithm selects entries from
throughout the table to xor with the data stream.  So this does not
imply that keys can be rejected quickly, nor does it suggest that the
particular setup algorithm used is particularly weak or was chosen
for export approval.  Sorry about the error.
