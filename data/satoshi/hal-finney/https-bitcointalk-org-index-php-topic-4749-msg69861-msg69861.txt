From my understanding, it is in theory possible to "double spend" a
transaction in limbo. If the second attempt with a higher transaction fee
makes it into a block, the first attempt will be interpreted as a double
spending attempt by miners and simply be ignored.  

A txn "in limbo" (in the transaction pool) will block double spends from being
forwarded by peers, or accepted by (unhacked) miners. The pool is only in
memory so gets wiped when the node is restarted, making network behavior
somewhat nondeterministic. The wallet currently retransmits unconfirmed txns
indefinitely, however the peers will not forward them unless/until the txns
are cleared from peer memory due to a restart.
