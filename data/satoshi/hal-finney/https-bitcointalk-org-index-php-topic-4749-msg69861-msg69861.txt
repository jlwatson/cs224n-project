A txn "in limbo" (in the transaction pool) will block double spends from being
forwarded by peers, or accepted by (unhacked) miners. The pool is only in
memory so gets wiped when the node is restarted, making network behavior
somewhat nondeterministic. The wallet currently retransmits unconfirmed txns
indefinitely, however the peers will not forward them unless/until the txns
are cleared from peer memory due to a restart.
