Here's how I would approach this idea. The concept would be to function in
max-anonymity mode by default as now, but to also specify a certain address as
being associated with an identity. Receiving coins to that address is trivial,
just give out that address for payment. Add a feature to make identified
payments from that address as you propose. Important, payments from that
address should use that same address for change. Equally important, make sure
that regular "anonymous" payments DO NOT use the identified address, otherwise
your anonymity will be compromised. That way, anonymous and identified
payments can coexist.  
  
You could also have more than one identified address, keeping each separate.
Probably you'd want to use the address label to choose which to pay with. But
the same principles would apply: change back to the same address, and never
use it for regular payments.  
  
As far as getting started, I'd like to see a sticky walking through the steps
to create a pull request. But yeah, you can check out from sourceforge using
svn, get your changes working, and post the output of svn diff as a patch.
