I have been working on a document describing in some detail how to use
the Cypherpunks anonymous remailers.  It is pretty long, about 25K,
but I'll post it here in a few days.

Meanwhile, here is a list of the current remailers which I know about.
If anyone else is running a remailer based on Eric Hughes' original
design, please let me know and I'll add it to the list.

All of the following remailers accept the basic "Request-Remailing-To"
remailing request:

The following remailers also accept the "Encrypted: PGP" function.
The public keys for all of the remailers (plus the special one mentioned
below) are in the keyring file below.  They can all be used for
anonymous addresses as described in the full document.

The next remailer is a variant on the Cypherpunks remailers.  It will
work _only_ with encrypted messages, using its public key (in the keyring
file below).  But it allows a simpler syntax.  It is not necessary to
put "Encrypted: PGP" into the message header.  In addition, the "::" pasting
operator is assumed, so you can leave that off.  Also, instead of
"Request-Remailing-To:" you can say just "To:".  So messages are much
simpler in format for this remailer.  This remailer runs at:

Here is a PGP keyring file containing keys for the encryption based
remailers listed here:
