This is how I understand transaction fees to work:  
  
\- the client offers a fee by creating a tx with a "surplus", ie. the input
amount is greater than the output amount  
  
\- when a miner creates a block he can create a transaction paying himself up
to 50 btc plus the sum of all the tx fees in the block  
  
The miner doesn't have to pay himself that much but the tx fees are lost
anyway.
