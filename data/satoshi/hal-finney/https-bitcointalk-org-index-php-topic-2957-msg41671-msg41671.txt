What you are doing looks pretty good to me now that I understand it better. I
tried hashing your data and got
90377525e05bd71ce8ba413a84fdaea299766732f165fab28a69d30c83337f9b, don't know
if that matches yours. The only other thing I can think of would be to try
reversing the hash on input to the ECDSA functions.
