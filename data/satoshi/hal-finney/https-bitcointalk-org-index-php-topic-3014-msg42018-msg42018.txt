Well my attempt to verify that sig in openssl failed, it didn't verify. That's
no surprise since the two methods also disagreed about the validity of the
bitcoin sig. I hoped I'd see something wrong in the data structures, but I
didn't. Your pubkey is a valid EC point on the secp256k1 curve. The signature
appears to be properly formatted.  
  
I'll see if I can think of anything else...
