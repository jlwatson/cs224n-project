  
I'd suggest people look at this PDF, make sure we're fixing the right problem.
This is a graph of orphan transactions showing dependencies. Note that there's
a chain of 100+ transactions all dependent on the one before. Probablythis is
the Faucet.  
  
It goes without saying that a tx can't go in a block if it's predecessors are
not in blocks. I wonder if a single faucet txn getting dropped could lead to a
whole chain of them being blocked?
