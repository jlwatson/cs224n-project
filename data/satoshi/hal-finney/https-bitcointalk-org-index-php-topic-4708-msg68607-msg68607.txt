I worry that Bitcoin can be seen as even more of a threat to the supremacy of
the dollar, which by this reasoning would make it terrorism. An extreme claim,
to be sure, but apparently the U.S. Is willing to go there.  
  
The government also advances this theory:  
  
  
Now this is really stretching the truth. Until the Civil War era, there was no
U.S. currency as such, rather paper money was issued, perfectly legally, by
private banks. There is no Constitutional prohibition of private currency.
There is a law that prohibits private metallic coins, 18 USC 486, which is
what they used against LD. It's ominous to see the U.S. expanding its claims
like this, to the point where they would cover Bitcoin.
