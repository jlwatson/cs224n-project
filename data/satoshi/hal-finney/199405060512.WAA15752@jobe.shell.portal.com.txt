Diffie-Hellman can be quite slow as well, depending on the size
of the exponents.  It involves calculating x**y, twice, where x
and y are about 512 to 1024 bits.  Some variants have the exponent
yl be smaller, around 140 bits, but if strong primes are used for
the modulus the exponent will be large like this.  And the Chinese
Remainder Theorem speedup used by PGP when RSA signing would not
be applicable here.  So calculating a DH key exchange could take
many times longer than an RSA signature by PGP.  This takes about
fifteen seconds on my old PC; doing a DH key exchange might take a
minute.


It might be possible to compute the DH in the background while the
conversation is going on, but if the computer is also compressing,
uncompressing, encrypting and decrypting at the same time, that's
not going to be easy.
