On the question of how many domain names to create per day:  
  
http://www.domaintools.com/internet-statistics/  
  
There are about 100 million active domain names, and 400 million expired ones.
About 300,000 changes occur per day, divided equally between creation,
expiration, and transfers.  
  
If we create only 50 domains per block, 6 blocks per hour, that is 7200 domain
names per day. At that rate it would take like 50 years to create 100 million
domains. So it seems necessary to make names faster.
