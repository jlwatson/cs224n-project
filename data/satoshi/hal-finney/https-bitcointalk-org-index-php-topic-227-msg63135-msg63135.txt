Here is a rather exhaustive analysis of the legality of private currencies in
the U.S., by GWU law professor Lewis Solomon:

He focusses on community "scrip" currencies like Ithaca Hours, and concludes
that they are probably legal. One caveat is that the book is from 1995, and of
course financial regulations have changed since then. Still community
currencies operate in the open, unmolested by the Feds.
