For the last day or two I have been getting several dozen messages
(67 today, a similar number yesterday) similar to the following:


The "PGP" message appears to be just an ascii-armoring of random bytes.

Is this an attempt by someone to provide the "masking" remailer traffic
we have been discussing for some time?  This is OK, but I think the volume
is too high.

What is the Do-Inject: header intended to accomplish?

The message apparently is intended to provide multiple remailing addresses per
message.  However, my remailer only does one remail address per message.

Also, my remailer does not accept "Anon-To" but only "Request-Remailing-To".
So all these messages are ending up in my mail box.

Anyone want to explain these?
