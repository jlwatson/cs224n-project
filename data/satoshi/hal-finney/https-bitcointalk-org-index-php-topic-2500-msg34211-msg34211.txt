Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist,
issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin
itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be
broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a
secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient.
Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be
impractical for medium to large value purchases.  
  
Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did
before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different
policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be
fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may
vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.  
  
George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail,
and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and
self-regulating.  
  
I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the "high-powered
money" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own
digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle
net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare
as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.
