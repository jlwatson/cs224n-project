Whats the general plan here? No reduction in names/block I assume? Won't this
make the first blocks incredible valuable and later blocks less valuable as
the goodness of remaining names declines? Maybe it should start really low
(1?) and move up gradually to a stable amount (100?)?  

  
This was on another thread but is relevant here. It is true, the first domain
name is likely much more valuable than the millionth. So even if we don't
reduce the number of DCC per block, the value will decrease much like Bitcoin
does by halving the block reward every two years. That means transaction fees
might have to rise substantially over time.  
  
Is it worth considering to increase the block creation rate above 6 per hour?
If we generate blocks every 5 minutes or even every 2-3 minutes instead of
every 10, that would be another way to speed up domain name availability.
