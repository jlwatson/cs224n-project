Unfortunately, I don't think perl is suitable, as it has no facilities for
multiprecision arithmetic.  I was talking to Henry Strickland at Crypto 
and he is working on a package that would use the scripting language tcl
(which is a little similar to perl) and could do this stuff.  Alternatively
you could use a public-domain package like gmp or perhaps the pgptools 
library created by Pr0duct Cypher.  That last one has MD5 hash built in so
it would have everything you need.  For that you would have to program in C
or perhaps C++ though.
