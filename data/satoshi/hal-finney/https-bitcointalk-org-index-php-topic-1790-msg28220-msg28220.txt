I agree with ribuck that DNS servers don't necessarily need to get paid, to
support Bitcoin domains. After all, what is the purpose of a DNS server? It is
to lookup domains for its clients, which are users wanting to connect to
computers using domain names. If BitDNS becomes popular, DNS servers will want
to be able to lookup those domains too. All that is necessary is to track the
block chain and maintain indexes and hash tables to record which domains are
in effect and their basic DNS data. DNS servers don't have to be Bitcoin
miners. The existing motivations for DNS servers to operate and provide lookup
serves to their clients will be sufficient to make them track Bitcoin domains.
