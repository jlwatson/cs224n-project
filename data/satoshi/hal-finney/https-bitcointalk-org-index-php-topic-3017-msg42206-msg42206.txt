What do you mean by walking the block chain? Could you clarify what you would
do when you receive a block containing a payment transaction to one of your
addresses? Do you need to go back and look at old blocks? Or can you just
assume it's valid because it's in a block, possibly waiting for some
confirmations, in which case maybe you don't need to save old blocks at all.
