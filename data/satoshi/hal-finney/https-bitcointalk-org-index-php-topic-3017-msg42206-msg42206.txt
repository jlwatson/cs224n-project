Walking the block chain means you don't have to store much data at all. In
fact, you only need to store the block locator, a series of block headers that
thin out exponentially from the head of the chain. I was planning on having
the app download a signed copy of the latest block locator from my own server
the first time it runs rather than doing a getheaders walk, as a performance
optimization (you already have to trust the author of your wallet software).  

What do you mean by walking the block chain? Could you clarify what you would
do when you receive a block containing a payment transaction to one of your
addresses? Do you need to go back and look at old blocks? Or can you just
assume it's valid because it's in a block, possibly waiting for some
confirmations, in which case maybe you don't need to save old blocks at all.
