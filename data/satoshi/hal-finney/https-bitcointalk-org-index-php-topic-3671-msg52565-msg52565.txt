I was an early participant on Less Wrong as well as its progenitor Overcoming
Bias. One principle of rationality is not to choose goals blindly, but to
think about what you ultimately want to accomplish, and decide what projects
make the most sense. That's why I asked, why Bitcoin?  
  
Much discussion on those sites is on cognitive bias, and IMO the most
important bias is overconfidence. Study after study has shown that people
vastly overestimate the accuracy of their predictions and estimates. The hard
step is taking this to heart, and accepting that it applies to you, not just
to people who disagree with you. Just to give you a taste of how far you are
from rationality, there is actually a mathematical proof that two sufficiently
rational people cannot disagree.  
  
According to these communities, one of the best ways to get unbiased estimates
of future events is the prediction market. They have strong track records and
good theory behind them. A Bitcoin based prediction market would be a great
asset and contribution to the world.
