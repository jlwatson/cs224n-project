According to Gavin's
https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcointools/blob/master/NOTES.txt,
serialization of any vector object gets preceded by a count of the number of
elements in the vector, in the variable-length 1/3/5/9 byte format. I added
this count field to the new wiki, e.g. to addr messages. Also, block messages
contain a vector of their transactions, so that part is also preceded by a
variable-length count.
