Another client is useful, especially since the current Bitcoin client is a big
mess. I was *shocked* that cryptography code looked like this.  

I'd like to hear some specific criticisms of the code. To me it looks like an
impressive job, although I'd wish for more comments. Now I've mostly studied
the init, main, script and a bit of net modules. This is some powerful
machinery.
