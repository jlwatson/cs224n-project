Actually one of the criteria for SHA-3 is speed, which is not particularly
important for Bitcoin. We might consider using a different approach.

These hash functions are slow but have a degree of provable security.  
  
There have also been various proposals for proof of work (POW) systems,
including some that were designed to resist hardware optimization. Perhaps
this could produce "fairer" generation where graphics cards and specialized
hardware wouldn't have such an advantage. (However people with access to large
networks of computers might dominate then.)
