I agree that the PAX shutdown is an ominous development.  Nobody's
internet access is perfectly free from the kinds of pressures that were
brought against PAX.  What steps can we take to keep the same thing from
happening to us?

I agree with Karl that a big step would be to spread remailers more widely.
Eric Hollander is running three remailers in addition to the ones Karl
mentioned - hh@soda.berkeley.edu, and two other machines which I don't
have handy.  They don't encrypt but they forward, and that's good enough
for many purposes.

Some time back, there was mention that the owner of the commercial Portal
system would run one.  Could someone follow up on that who knows him?

PGP is gradually disappearing from U.S. sites where it used to be
available.  Recently it got taken off the EFF area on Compuserve.
We can't afford to see encryption and remailers be slowly strangled.
