Almost everyone had transactions from "united". It does NOT mean that your
account was compromised. It does mean that the attacker has your username. It
was just them using the merchant API to send you 0 BTC.  

Does this mean the merchant API has/had a way of discovering account names?
And this involved sending a dummy transaction of 0 to each account? Has this
been fixed?
