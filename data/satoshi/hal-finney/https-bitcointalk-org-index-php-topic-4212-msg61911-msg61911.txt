In another thread, they proposed bringing accounts into the UI, and doing them
a little differently. Every transaction would be labelled with an account
name. You could filter your wallet and only view txns for a certain account.
And most importantly, you could pay from an account, and it would only use
coins from that account.  
  
This would make accounts be like virtual wallets, so you could have anonymous
accounts and identity based accounts, and the coins wouldn't get intermixed.
This should satisfy at least some use cases for choosing coins to pay with.  
  
Maybe these should be called something different from accounts, as current
accounts are kind of fictitious. Moving money between accounts is currently
just bookkeeping, while with what I am talking about it would require an
actual transaction. Maybe these should be called something like virtual
wallets, or wallet partitions.
