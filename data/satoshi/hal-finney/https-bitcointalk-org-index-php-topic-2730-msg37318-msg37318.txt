Would it work, on a new machine with no wallet, to create the .bitcoin
directory, with wallet.dat a symlink to an empty file on your 5MB volume? Then
when you launch the client for the first time, would it create the wallet on
the encrypted volume? Or would it just overwrite the symlink file with wallet
data?
