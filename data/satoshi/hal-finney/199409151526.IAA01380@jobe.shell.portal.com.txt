I'm not familiar with this term, "submarine" patent application.  But
don't they have one year from the date of first publication to apply for
a patent?  It seems that this could count as first publication, so they
would have one year from now to get their patent application in.  As I
said before, the NSA has indicated similar plans if Clipper is ever
reverse engineered.
