I find it distracting to see the # confirmations for each transaction. Do I
really need to know that there are 20,132 confirmations to a transaction? And,
oh look, it just went up to 20,133. Anything beyond a few dozen is overkill
IMO. I propose that beyond a certain number, say 100, we just display it as
confirmed.  
  
Even more useful would be to display the date by old transactions. That would
help me remember what they were.
