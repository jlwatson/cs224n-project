You get an A+ for convenience, but selling an irrevocable currency for
revocable credit is fundamentally a bad idea.  

... or, in other words: have you thought about what will happen when somebody
buys a bunch of bitcoins from you and then disputes the charge on their credit
card?  
  
Or worse: buys a bunch from you, turns around and sells them to you. Waits a
day. Does it again.  
And then disputes all the charges at the end of the month...
