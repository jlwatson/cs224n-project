  
CSV file with the private key and block numbers is a good idea, although for
it to be a valid CSV file then it needs to have a fixed number of columns.  
  
I'd modify the design slightly to be just:  
base58 encoded privkey,block number  
... where block number is the block number of the earliest input (that'll save
rescanning time-- you probably always want to rescan from the earliest block
number, anyway, in case more payments were sent after you exported the key).  
  
Also what do you mean by "export" -- write and then remove the keys from the
wallet? Write a newly generated key and generate a payment-to-that-key for a
given amount of coins?  
  
I think any code that removes keys from the wallet (or generates payments to
keys that are never added to the wallet) needs to be structured as two
distinct steps:  
1\. Write the keys to <destination>  
2\. Read <destination> to make sure it is valid, and, if it is, delete the
corresponding keys from the wallet (or generate the send-to-self txn).
