 ~~Looks like somebody's playing with a tweaked bitcoin-- if you trace back
the inputs they're from a previous block that has the same odd pattern.  
  
The standard coin selection algorithm in bitcoin would generate a one input /
one output transaction.~~  
  
Hal and theymos are right-- I misremembered how the coin selection algorithm
works.
