Cross Origin Resource Sharing lets servers support cross-origin Javascript. It
is supported by the latest browsers (although IE support is... different), and
involves sending CORS headers in responses.  
  
Adding this enables Javascript code running in a browser to connect with any
bitcoin/bitcoind that allows RPC connections from the browser's IP address and
has the right rpc username/password.  
  
Code changes are minimal (4 lines of code to output CORS headers). Thanks to
tcatm for implementing and testing.
