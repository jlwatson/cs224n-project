You're over-reacting.

Whether Craig was or wasn't Satoshi doesn't matter for the long-term success of failure of Bitcoin.

If you're worried about a bunch of early-mined Bitcoin flooding on to the market all at once and crashing the price:  that seems extremely unlikely to me, much less likely than other events that could crash the Bitcoin price. Why would somebody with that much coin want to crash the market by selling all at once?
