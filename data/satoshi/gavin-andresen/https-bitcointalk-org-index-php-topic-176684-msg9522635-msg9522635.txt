Please correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this an issue right now? Assuming
that mining is profitable (i.e. mining revenue is greater than cost), a 51%
attack would essentially cost nothing because the attacker would receive all
the mining revenue (which exceeds his cost because we assume that mining is
profitable). This is independent of subsidy in relation to transaction fees.  

  
You are wrong.  
  
Example that should make it clear:  
  
Honest miner with 50% hash power: will mine 6 blocks every two hours (on
average). Rest of the network will mine the other 6 blocks.  
  
Attacking miner with 50% hash power: will mine 6 blocks every four hours (on
average), because they refuse to build on anybody else's blocks.  
  
Result: if the attacker is the longest chain, they'll get half as many BTC as
honest mining (if they are unlucky and are not the longest chain, they'll get
zero).  
  
If they could keep up the attack for a full month until difficulty adjusts
then they'll start making what they would have been making if they were
honest.
