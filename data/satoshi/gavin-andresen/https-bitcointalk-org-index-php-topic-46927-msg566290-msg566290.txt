This is why I don't pull additions or major changes to RPC commands without at
least a couple of people looking at them and either saying "yup, that's
exactly how I would do it" or "it'd be better if...."  
  
I agree with Mike, the -coinbaser <cmd> should be separate from setauxwork.  
  
Does setauxwork interact with the new getmemorypool RPC command at all? Should
it?  
  
And should there be a listauxwork RPC command?
