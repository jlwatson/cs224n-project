Interesting idea.  
  
So, lets see, I create a transaction to pay you (say) 100 of my newly minted
bitcoins.  
  
That'll be a transaction with two 50BTC TxIns (signed by me, pointing to two
mature GENERATE transactions somewhere in the block chain) and one 100BTC
TxOuts.  
  
You want to make sure I haven't double-spent those TxIns, so instead of
flooding the network with that transaction you find the hash of the two
GENERATE transactions and send two queries down into the DHT network: "Hey,
here's a transaction, tell me if it is valid." They say "yup", and then...
what? Include it in any blocks they're lucky enough to generate? Broadcast it
to everybody (which'd be no better than the current scheme) or some subset of
the DHT network (what subset?)?  
  
How do you know that you won't get a different answer to "is this transaction
valid" if you ask again in 10 minutes when the network topology might have
changed?  
  
I don't know much about DHT networks and how they manage to keep reliable
information when nodes may be coming and going (or buggy or malicious). How
would it work?
