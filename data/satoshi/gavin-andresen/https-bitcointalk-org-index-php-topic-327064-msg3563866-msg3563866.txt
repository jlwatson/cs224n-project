By the way:  
  
I really like your proposal, ByteCoin. I think it captures the intuitive
notion of "incentivize publishing blocks immediately as the best policy".  
  
IF all proof-of-work-valid chains are relayed (and, as I said, my intuition is
that they should be) then highest-number-of-transactionseconds seems like a
very good criteria for resolving ties.
