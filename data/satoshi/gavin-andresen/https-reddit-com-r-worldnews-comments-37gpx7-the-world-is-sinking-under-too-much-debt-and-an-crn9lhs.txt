All debts? Do government obligations (like pensions and benefits for retirees) count as debt?

If you just mean individual debt like mortgages or student loans, then forgiving them would immediately make banks insolvent-- they wouldn't be able to pay back their depositors (the money you have in the bank is a debt the bank owes you, i suppose if ALL  debts are forgiven and we started with a clean slate that wouldn't be a problem, everybody would just lose money saved in a bank).
