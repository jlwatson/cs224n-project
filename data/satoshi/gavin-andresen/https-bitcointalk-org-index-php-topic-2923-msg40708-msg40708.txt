Your calculations are garbage. You cannot spend coins 80 times in an hour. The
attacker has the power to rewrite a history that doesn't include him spending
the coins, that is all. He can't simultaneously convince 80 people that they
have the same coins.  

  
FreeMoney is absolutely right.  
  
The only way to get 80 people to accept the same 400 bitcoins would be to
control all of their bitcoin connections and feed them different versions of
the block chain.  
  
And THAT will be impossible, because the people you're trying to rip off
(merchants selling stuff) are exactly the people with long-running, well-
connected bitcoin nodes.
