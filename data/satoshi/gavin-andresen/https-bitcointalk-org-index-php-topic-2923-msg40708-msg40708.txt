  
FreeMoney is absolutely right.  
  
The only way to get 80 people to accept the same 400 bitcoins would be to
control all of their bitcoin connections and feed them different versions of
the block chain.  
  
And THAT will be impossible, because the people you're trying to rip off
(merchants selling stuff) are exactly the people with long-running, well-
connected bitcoin nodes.
