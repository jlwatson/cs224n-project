I continue to maintain that market forces can rightsize MAX_BLOCK_SIZE if an
algorithm with a feedback mechanism can be introduced, and that doing so
introduces both less centralization risk than an arbitrary patch, and less
risk of future manual arbitrary adjustments.  
Fix it right, fix it once.  

  
I think you are confusing MAX_BLOCKSIZE with the floating, whatever-the
market-demands blocksize.  
  
MAX_BLOCKSIZE is, in my mind, purely a safety valve-- a "just in case" upper
limit to make sure it doesn't grow faster than affordable hardware and
software can support.  
  
Ideally, we never bump into it. If we go with my proposal (increase to 20MB
now, then double ten times over the next twenty years) I think it is
reasonably likely the market-determined size will never bump into
MAX_BLOCKSIZE.  
  
I think it is very unlikely that in 20 years we will need to support more
Bitcoin transactions than all of the cash, credit card and international wire
transactions that happen in the world today (and that is the scale of
transactions that a pretty-good year-2035 home computer and network connection
should be able to support).
