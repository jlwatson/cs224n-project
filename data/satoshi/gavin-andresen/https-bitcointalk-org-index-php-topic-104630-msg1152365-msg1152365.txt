You address it by explaining where the bitcoins come from for the 'guaranteed'
payouts.  
  
Credit cards make money by charging merchants a fee, charging interest on late
payments, etc. And they mitigate their risk by running credit reports on
borrowers.  
  
Legitimate lenders do something similar.  
  
So, I'll ask again: what is your business model? How will you make the money
to payback the people who are sending you X bitcoins and expecting to get X+Y
back in a day?
