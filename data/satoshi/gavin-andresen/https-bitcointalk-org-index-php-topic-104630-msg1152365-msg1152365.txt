I'm sorry to hear that. All those people in the lending subforum who borrow
and lend for profit must all be ponzi schemes too if we follow that logic. And
we can also include everyone with credit cards too. Hmmmm, how then do we
address it?  

You address it by explaining where the bitcoins come from for the 'guaranteed'
payouts.  
  
Credit cards make money by charging merchants a fee, charging interest on late
payments, etc. And they mitigate their risk by running credit reports on
borrowers.  
  
Legitimate lenders do something similar.  
  
So, I'll ask again: what is your business model? How will you make the money
to payback the people who are sending you X bitcoins and expecting to get X+Y
back in a day?
