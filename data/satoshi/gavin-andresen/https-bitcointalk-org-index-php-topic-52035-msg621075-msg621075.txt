Neither of those addresses are valid according to my bitcoind:  
  

Code:

$ bitcoind validateaddress 1AYSPTVt8WytG12Kz9guUpXjwAMFZG9CJh  
{  
"isvalid" : false  
}  
$ bitcoind validateaddress 1AYSPTVt8WytG12Kz9guUpXjeAMFb7AX2K  
{  
"isvalid" : false  
}  

  
The checksum in addresses is 4 bytes, so there is a one-in-four-billion chance
that a random typo would get you a valid address.
