Binaries for Bitcoin version 0.3.21 are available at:  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.21/  
  
Changes and new features from the 0.3.20 release include:  
  
* Universal Plug and Play support. Enable automatic opening of a port  
for incoming connections by running bitcoin or bitcoind with the  
\- -upnp=1 command line switch or using the Options dialog box.  
  
* Support for full-precision bitcoin amounts. You can now send, and  
bitcoin will display, bitcoin amounts smaller than 0.01. However,  
sending fewer than 0.01 bitcoins still requires a 0.01 bitcoin fee (so  
you can send 1.0001 bitcoins without a fee, but you will be asked to  
pay a fee if you try to send 0.0001).  
  
* A new method of finding bitcoin nodes to connect with, via DNS A  
records. Use the -dnsseed option to enable.  
  
For developers, changes to bitcoin's remote-procedure-call API:  
  
* New rpc command "sendmany" to send bitcoins to more than one address  
in a single transaction.  
  
* Several bug fixes, including a serious intermittent bug that would  
sometimes cause bitcoind to stop accepting rpc requests.  
  
* -logtimestamps option, to add a timestamp to each line in debug.log.  
  
* Immature blocks (newly generated, under 120 confirmations) are now  
shown in listtransactions.
