Unless you want to argue that fungibility is not related to anonymity of
digital tokens, or that fungibility is not an important property of money.  

Of course fungibility is important.  
  
But fungibility isn't all-or-nothing, and, in my humble opinion, it isn't all-
important. Refusing to accept dollar bills or bitcoins that you believe were
obtained illegally makes them less fungible, but so what? It's the right thing
to do.
