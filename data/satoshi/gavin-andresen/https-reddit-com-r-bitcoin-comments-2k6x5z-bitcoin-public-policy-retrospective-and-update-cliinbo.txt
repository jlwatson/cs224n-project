I can assure you, Sauron saw us long ago. Jim is right, without hard work from Patrick and Jim it would be much harder to use Bitcoin in the US.

You know the threads that pop up here with "my bank account was shutdown because... (I use localbitcoins.com) (I run a Bitcoin business)" ? Jim is working to solve that problem.

What are you doing besides bitching?
