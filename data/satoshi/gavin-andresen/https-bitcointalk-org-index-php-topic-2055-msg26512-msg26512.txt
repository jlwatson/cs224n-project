  
Bitcoin contains this magical little piece of code:  

Code:

int64 GetBlockValue(int nHeight, int64 nFees)  
{  
int64 nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;  
  
// Subsidy is cut in half every 4 years  
nSubsidy >>= (nHeight / 210000);  
  
return nSubsidy + nFees;  
}  

  
If you try to create more than GetBlockValue coins (50, right now) when you
get lucky and generate a block, all the other clients will reject it.  
  
There are a bunch of other checks to prevent cheating (make sure you actually
did the work to find a valid hash for the block, make sure all the
transactions in the block are valid, etc), but that simple little piece of
code is what restricts the supply.
