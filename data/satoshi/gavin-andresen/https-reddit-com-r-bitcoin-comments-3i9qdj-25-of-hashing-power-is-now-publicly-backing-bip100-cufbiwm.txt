From an email I sent yesterday:

"I think that's the thing that bothers me most about this whole thing-- I said I was stepping aside as lead of Core to focus on bigger, cross-implementation issues. And I did, spending a lot of time talking to people and writing and then coding up a compromise that I thought could reach broad consensus (not just among developers-- there are lots of people who want NO block size limit at all).

And then all that hard work is dismissed and it is 'well, Gavin hasn't even really submitted much code lately....' "

-------------

That said, I'm proud of the code I've contributed lately -- for example, the RollingBloomFilter class that other people have picked up and are using for various optimizations (I implemented it to optimize memory usage).

And the accurate sigop/sighash counting code will almost certainly be used by *whatever* max-block-size-increase proposal eventually gets consensus.

And before all of that, I was working hard on testing infrastructure; I'm happy to see people extend the Python-based qa/rpc-tests (and REALLY happy about the work the Chain Code Labs folks have done to take that to another level).
