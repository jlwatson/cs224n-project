  
Non-standard transactions are allowed-by-default on the test network. So
people can test things out.  
  
They are "discouraged-by-default" on the main network (discouraged means not
relayed to peers, and not included in blocks by the default mining code).  
  
I think etotheipi is right: last I heard, Eligius was the only mining pool
with different rules for non-standard transactions.
