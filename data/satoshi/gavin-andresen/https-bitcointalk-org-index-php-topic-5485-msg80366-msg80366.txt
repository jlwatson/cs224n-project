I think this is ready:  
I found one edge case during testing, and after discussion on #bitcoin-dev
changed the information reported. The edge case was reporting the coinbase
transactions from orphaned blocks. Here's the scenario:  
  
\+ As soon as you generate a block, the coinbase transaction goes into your
wallet as a 1-confirmation transaction. Before this patch, that transaction
was not listed in the listtransactions output. With this patch, it is (as
"category" : "immature", "confirmations" : 1).  
  
\+ If that block is orphaned, the coinbase transaction is no longer valid.
With this patch, it will be reported at "category" : "orphan", "confirmations"
: 0  
  
\+ When a coinbase transaction has 120 confirmations, it will be reported as
"category" : "generate" (as before).
