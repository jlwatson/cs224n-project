I think this is ready:

This patch adds immature generated blocks to listtransactions. They are
reported just like mature blocks, except the category is 'immature' instead of
'generate'.  
  
This functionality is needed by people creating alternative, JSON-RPC-based
GUIs, and is useful for impatient miners who currently grep through debug.log
or use unofficial patches to see not-yet-mature blocks they've generated.

  
I found one edge case during testing, and after discussion on #bitcoin-dev
changed the information reported. The edge case was reporting the coinbase
transactions from orphaned blocks. Here's the scenario:  
  
\+ As soon as you generate a block, the coinbase transaction goes into your
wallet as a 1-confirmation transaction. Before this patch, that transaction
was not listed in the listtransactions output. With this patch, it is (as
"category" : "immature", "confirmations" : 1).  
  
\+ If that block is orphaned, the coinbase transaction is no longer valid.
With this patch, it will be reported at "category" : "orphan", "confirmations"
: 0  
  
\+ When a coinbase transaction has 120 confirmations, it will be reported as
"category" : "generate" (as before).
