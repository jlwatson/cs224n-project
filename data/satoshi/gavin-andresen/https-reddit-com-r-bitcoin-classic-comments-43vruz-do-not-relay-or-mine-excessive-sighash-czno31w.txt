It is possible to create very large transactions that take a very long time (a couple of minutes) of CPU time to validate.

Ordinary users can't get those transactions relayed across the network or mined into blocks, because transactions larger than 100,000 bytes are rejected by the network. So this isn't a critical problem.

However, a "rogue miner" can produce a one megabyte block with a one megabyte transaction that takes a long time to validate. One miner already did, accidentally (block 364,422 -- we know it was an accident because if they were really trying to produce a slow-to-validate block they could have made it even slower).

If nothing was done as we move to 2mb blocks, the problem gets four times worse. To make sure the problem doesn't get any worse, a new rule is added (and code written) to limit the amount of work done to validate a block.
