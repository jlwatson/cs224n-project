Is there a good open source piece of code we can use to test to make sure
we're generating good entropy?  
  
These bugs should be investigated and fixed (Sergio can you open issues on
github?), but I'd like a test we could periodically run to make sure they stay
fixed. Even better is if the code could monitor itself and let the user know
if there's a problem with entropy generation.
