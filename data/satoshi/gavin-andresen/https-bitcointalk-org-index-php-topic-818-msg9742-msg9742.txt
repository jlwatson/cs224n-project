RE: could you make through adroit use of the scripting language: you could
hide the receiving address, but not the amount.  
  
Bitcoin needs to see TxOut amounts so it can add them up and make sure the
transaction includes any necessary fees.  
  
And to make sure the transaction is valid, although I suppose it could allow
invalid-but-not-yet-decrypted transactions into the block chain, and just not
allow them to be ever spent (it'd be a complicated way of deleting BTC). But
that makes me extremely nervous-- it seems to me it just makes things more
complicated and more likely to be exploited.  
  
Also, this: "All the network nodes try to decrypt the message with each of
their public keys" ... won't scale. Busy nodes will have more and more public
keys over time (as they give out different receiving addresses for each
purchase transaction), and trying them all whenever an encrypted transaction
comes over the wire will take an ever-increasing amount of time.
