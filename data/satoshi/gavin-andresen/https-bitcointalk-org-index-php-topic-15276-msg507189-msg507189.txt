Thanks; we really ought to do a parallel release of binaries with 0.4.0, and
maybe keep it up until the core dev team finally merges it.  

I think everybody would like to merge bitcoin-qt as soon as the 0.4 release is
shipped (see the bitcoin-dev mailing list for the current known bugs).  
  
Closing the dozens of wxWidgets-related GUI bugs in the issues list will give
me great pleasure...
