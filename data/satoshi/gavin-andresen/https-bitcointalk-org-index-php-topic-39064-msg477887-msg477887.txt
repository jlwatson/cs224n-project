My worry is that we'll schedule a blockchain split 6 months from now, and
between now and then somebody implements a secure, way-cool, everybody-
decides-to-use, way to use your email address as a bitcoin address.  
  
So my receiving address is 'gavinandresen@gmail.com' and suddenly all the
arguing over length of the bitcoin addresses used behind the scenes was just a
huge waste of time.  
  
I'm as guilty of doing stuff like that as the next geek-- I can get so focused
on one little bit of a problem I don't even realize solving a larger problem
makes the whole issue go away. Slap me upside the head if you see me going
down that path...
