BTW, can someone explain in layman words where from priority is defined?  

  
Priority is a function of how many bitcoins are involved in the transaction
(more is higher priority), the size (in bytes) of the transaction (smaller is
higher priority), and the age of the transaction's previous transactions
(older is higher priority).  
  
Your transaction is taking a long time because it involved only 0.14 BTC which
you got from a transaction that happened earlier today. If you were running
bitcoin version 0.3.21, it would have required that you add a 0.01BTC fee to
send it.
