So either a fifth optional argument for the P2SH scripts or extending the 3rd
argument to include both privkeys and P2SH script would do the job.  

I'm leaning towards extending the 2nd argument, to give previous inputs and,
if the previous inputs are P2SH, previous inputs scripts.  
  
Along with a new 'rawmultisigaddress' that is just like addmultisigaddress,
but doesn't add the redemption script to the wallet but instead returns it.

... or was it the addmultisigaddress that added the P2SH scripts?  

addmultisigaddress added the P2SH scripts to the wallet.  
  
RE: when can you expect a fix:  
  
It is too late to add new RPC features to the 0.7 release, so no fix until the
next release.
