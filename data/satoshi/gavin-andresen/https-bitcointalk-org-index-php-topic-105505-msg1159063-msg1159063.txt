I'm leaning towards extending the 2nd argument, to give previous inputs and,
if the previous inputs are P2SH, previous inputs scripts.  
  
Along with a new 'rawmultisigaddress' that is just like addmultisigaddress,
but doesn't add the redemption script to the wallet but instead returns it.  
  
addmultisigaddress added the P2SH scripts to the wallet.  
  
RE: when can you expect a fix:  
  
It is too late to add new RPC features to the 0.7 release, so no fix until the
next release.
