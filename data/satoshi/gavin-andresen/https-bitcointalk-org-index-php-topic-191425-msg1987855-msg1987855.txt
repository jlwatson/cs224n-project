RE: NODE_RELAYCOST :  
  
I'm generally against any "take my word for it" settings. What would stop
somebody Up To No Good from setting NODE_RELAYCOST and then lying about what
they will relay? Miners might decide to try to increase fees by Sybil-
attacking the network and lying about NODE_RELAYCOST....
