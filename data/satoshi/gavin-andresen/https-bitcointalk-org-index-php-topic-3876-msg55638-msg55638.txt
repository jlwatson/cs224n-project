I've been thinking a lot and trying to educate myself on best practices for
securing the bitcoin wallet.  
  
Part of the solution could be a smart card that supports ECDSA; the PKCS #11
standard supports elliptic key crypto, so it is feasible to have a hardware
token that stores your private keys and never lets them out of the token.  
  
If the token includes some type of biometric identification (e.g. built-in
fingerprint reader or mechanism for entering a password) then there is no way
for the trojan to spoof new transactions.  
  
But [mike] is right-- if your computer is infected by a trojan the trojan can
just rewrite the bitcoin address and amount before the software asks the
hardware token to sign the payment transaction. The only way to prevent that
is if the hardware token can somehow display the transaction details
independent of the infected computer. That's one very sophisticated hardware
token...  
  
Hopefully Hal and bitcoinex will now tell us how all this was solved years ago
and how an iPhone app synchronized with a dumb-ish smart card can use smart
crypto to make it all work....
