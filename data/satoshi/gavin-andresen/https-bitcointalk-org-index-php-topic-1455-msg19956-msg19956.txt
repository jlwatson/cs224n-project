Apparently the debug file is closed after *every* printf (causing a flush, and
on my system a bunch on crypto overhead).  
  
Since FileVault is a standard option on a Mac, I recommend either not closing
the file (os will clean it up), or disabling debugging to a file on macs.  

  
Hmmm....  
  
At some point (bitcoin 0.9?) debug.log should contain only really critical
errors/warnings. Right now it is more of a trace.log.  
  
Flushing it after every write is the correct thing to do-- otherwise critical
information about what caused a crash could easily be lost.  
  
Always closing and re-opening it is darn convenient if you've got a log-
rotating script running... but working poorly with FileVault is definitely a
bug.
