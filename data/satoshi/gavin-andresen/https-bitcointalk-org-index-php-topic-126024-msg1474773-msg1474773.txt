Isn't two-factor something that's already been implemented, or already worked
on ? Ie. you want to send coins, and then you have to use two devices to do it
?  

  
It is very high on the priority list, yes. Miners already support it, but
there are still a couple of steps to go before you can create a wallet split
between Bitcoin-Qt running on your desktop computer and an app running on your
iPhone.
