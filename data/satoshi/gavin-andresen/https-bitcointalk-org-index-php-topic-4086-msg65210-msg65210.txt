It does not work that way .. printf("%.8f") behaviour is inconsistent across
platform. If you don't believe, try  
  

Code:

printf("%.2f", -999.04)  

  
\-- some platform give -999.03, some give -999.04.  

  
I tried it... got -999.04 on my Mac and Linux machines. What platform gives
the wrong answer?
