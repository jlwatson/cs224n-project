Making the fee transaction depend on the block's coinbase would run afoul of
this code in CTransaction::ConnectInputs:  

Code:

// If prev is coinbase, check that it's matured  
if (txPrev.IsCoinBase())  
for (CBlockIndex* pindex = pindexBlock; pindex && pindexBlock->nHeight -
pindex->nHeight < COINBASE_MATURITY; pindex = pindex->pprev)  
if (pindex->nBlockPos == txindex.pos.nBlockPos && pindex->nFile ==
txindex.pos.nFile)  
return error("ConnectInputs() : tried to spend coinbase at depth %d",
pindexBlock->nHeight - pindex->nHeight);  

  
... and the entire block would be rejected as invalid. Which is a good thing,
otherwise miners could get around the "no spending newly minted coins for
COINBASE_MATURITY blocks" rule.
