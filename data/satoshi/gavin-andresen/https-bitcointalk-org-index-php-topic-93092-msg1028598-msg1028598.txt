wow that forum sure looks like a bureaucratic hell.  

Mmm. That's why if I were King I'd fast forward to a couple years from now
when there were several mature bitcoin clients and bitcoin.org would not list
any directly at all (see w3c.org for an example, you won't find a "Download a
Web Browser Now!" link).  
  
But I'm not King and unlike the Web there aren't a bunch of mature, well-
funded bitcoin clients to choose from yet.
