^As of Jan/13 are they all still required? Anything missing? Can I follow the
instructions found here:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.txt ?  

Yes, those instructions should work, but build-osx.txt tells you how to build
bitcoind. See  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/readme-qt.rst  
... for very similar instructions on building Bitcoin-Qt  
  
readme-qt.rst suggests downloading and installing the `Qt Mac OS X SDK` from
the QT website, but you can also:  
port install qt4-mac  
  
If something doesn't work, post here, or, even better, submit a patch for the
documentation.
