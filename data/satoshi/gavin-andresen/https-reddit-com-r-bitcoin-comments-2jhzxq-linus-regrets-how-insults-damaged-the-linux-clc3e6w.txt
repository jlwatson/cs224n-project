"mel" : you're not helping promote reasonable discourse here, using innuendo ("don't want to start naming names") and then lies (making up fake quotes).

I also wish Mr. Todd had a less inflammatory communication style and more humility, but this isn't the way to convince him maybe sometimes he doesn't express himself clearly (and if we were all just as smart as he is we'd understand what he is saying the very first time he says it) or that perhaps not everybody shares his priorities or concerns.
