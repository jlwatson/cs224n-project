IsStandard() is a permanent part of the protocol with BIP 16.  

  
No, it really isn't.  
  
Here's a possible future implementation of IsStandard():  
  

Code:

bool  
IsStandard()  
{  
return true;  
}  

  
I like the idea of a future IsStandard() that allows more transaction types,
but only if they're under some (sane) resource limits.
