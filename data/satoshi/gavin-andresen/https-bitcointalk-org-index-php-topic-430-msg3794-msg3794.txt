If that coin is one of the inputs to a later valid transaction, then it is
spent and cannot be spent again.  
  
That later transaction is the record that somebody spent the coin; it is
signed with the private key, and that key (which Bitcoin keeps for you in your
wallet) should be known only to the owner.
