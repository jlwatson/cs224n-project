Requests get discussed (where?  

  
Yes - where?  
  
I found that an email list was nearly ideal for such work when in the Linux
kernel (the famous lkml list.)  

  
Let's try using the github Pull Request system for discussing pull requests:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls  
  
That ties the discussion to the proposed code changes, is a natural way to
create separate 'threads', and will be a convenient place to point to in
release notes.  
  
And lets talk about potential code changes (pre pull request) here in this
forum.  
  
I'd rather not introduce Yet Another Place (we've already got these forums,
IRC chat, and github) to talk about bitcoin development.
