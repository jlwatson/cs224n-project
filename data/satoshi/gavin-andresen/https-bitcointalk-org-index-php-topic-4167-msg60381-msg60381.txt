RE: roadmap for v0.4 : I worry that we'll spend time creating a roadmap and
then... people will work on whatever strikes their fancy. So the 0.4 release
will end up being completely different from what the roadmap says.  
  
That said, I'll start a roadmap thread; maybe we CAN all agree on priorities
and find people to actually work on the highest priority stuff.
