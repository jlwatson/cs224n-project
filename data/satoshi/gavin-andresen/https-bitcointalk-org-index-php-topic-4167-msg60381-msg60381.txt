\- tag these minor releases in git, too  
\- sign tags with gpg (git tag -s -u <email> <tag>)  

  
The tag is v0.3.20.2, and it is signed by my (gavinandresen@gmail.com) gpg
key.  
  
RE: roadmap for v0.4 : I worry that we'll spend time creating a roadmap and
then... people will work on whatever strikes their fancy. So the 0.4 release
will end up being completely different from what the roadmap says.  
  
That said, I'll start a roadmap thread; maybe we CAN all agree on priorities
and find people to actually work on the highest priority stuff.
