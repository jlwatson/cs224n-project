Please, Satoshi, i urge you to rethink, and stop contributing to the MIT-
licensed client and continue working on a GPL-version.  

  
Satoshi is busy. Doing what, I have no idea-- maybe he's working on a GPL-
version of bitcoin, but I doubt it.  
  
In any case, I wouldn't expect any opinion on GPL versus MIT from him.  
  
My opinion: I've got better things to do than worry about which open source
license is most appropriate. No software license has magical powers that will
prevent 'bad guys' from trying to do bad things.
