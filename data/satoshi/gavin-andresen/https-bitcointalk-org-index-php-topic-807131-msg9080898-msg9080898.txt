  
That **is** a feature of Bitcoin-Qt. Unconfirmed dust transactions don't enter
the memory pool, so they are not relayed, not included in blocks being mined,
and not displayed by the wallet.  
  
If I recall correctly, if they DO get mined into a block by somebody then they
are displayed. Ignoring them and not adding them to the wallet in that case
might be a nice feature, although today's dust might be tomorrow's treasure if
prices rise another couple orders of magnitude.
