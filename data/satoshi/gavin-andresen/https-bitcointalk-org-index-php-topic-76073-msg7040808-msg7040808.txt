Two years later, Gavin still won't answer this question:

I'll break my "don't feed the trolls" rule:  
  
You need two things to get private bitcoin transactions:  
  
1) An anonymous connection to the Internet. Bitcoin Core does a good job of
this, working nicely through Tor and/or as a hidden service (thanks to Pieter
Wuille for writing that code).  
  
2) A privacy-aware wallet.  
  
The Bitcoin Core wallet needs to be completely rewritten, not just for privacy
but to get rid of the Berkeley DB dependency, implement HD keys, implement
multisig, CoinJoin, etc etc etc....  
  
Nobody has stepped up to do that, so it hasn't happened; in fact, we are going
in the opposite direction, moving wallet functionality out of Core (and we
might eventually drop wallet functionality entirely to concentrate on
transaction validation and blockchain handling).  
  
Why do you ask?
