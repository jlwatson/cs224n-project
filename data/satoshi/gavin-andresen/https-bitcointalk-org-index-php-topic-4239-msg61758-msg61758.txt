My question is:  
Is it a bug (not to see the payer address) or there is no bug and I have to
ask my customers to pay to my IP to be able to know the payer address?  

  
There is no bug, but if you want to know one of your customer's bitcoin
addresses (maybe you want to send them a refund?) you **must** ask them. They
might be using an escrow service like ClearCoin or, as theymos says, using a
shared wallet service like MyBitcoin.
