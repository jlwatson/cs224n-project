0.3.20 will support listtransactions '*' for all transactions.  
  
Transactions since <txid> .... sounds dangerous. Are you trying to mirror the
transaction database that bitcoin keeps? If you are, are you sure you'll deal
properly with (rare) block chain re-organizations where transactions that you
thought had one confirmation turn out to be invalid in a new fork of the
chain?  
  
I can imagine subtle bugs-- you ask for transactions since <txid> but that
txid turns out to be an orphan transaction (double-spend on the losing side of
a block chain re-org) so bitcoin returns... what?  
  
All non-orphan transactions with transaction time equal to or greater than a
given timestamp might work-- but what is your use case?
