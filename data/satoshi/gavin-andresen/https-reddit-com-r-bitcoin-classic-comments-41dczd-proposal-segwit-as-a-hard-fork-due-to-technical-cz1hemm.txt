There are hard forks, then there are REALLY HARD forks.

Any change that requires ever single transaction-creating piece of software to upgrade all at once would be a REALLY HARD fork.

And if I consider the risks and benefits of doing that... The only scenario that makes sense is some critical security flaw that can't be fixed in some other, more compatible way.

Otherwise, there is too big a risk a lot of people would lose access to their bitcoins because they were locked up in hardware wallets incapable of creating spiffy, new, technical-debt-free transactions.
