To get even more "meta" : ask yourself why _anything_ has value.  
  
Tools, like hammers or cars or pants, have value mostly because they're useful
and it takes effort to create them.  
  
Some things have value because they're beautiful or rare.  
  
Bitcoins have value because they are useful and rare. As more and more people
use them, they're useful for more and more things-- so their value will
increase. A lot of the current value of bitcoin is people who realize this and
are trying to 'buy in early' -- they think that bitcoin will be used for more
trading next year, so the value will be higher, so they want to get some now
before the price rises.  
  
I have no idea what the "right" value for bitcoin is, but I am very encouraged
by all of the fantastic, innovative ways people are using bitcoin. I expect
most of those experiments will fail, and I hope that everybody realizes that
there will be lots of failures along the way to what I hope will be a huge
success.
