A transaction is final if:  
  
All of its sequence numbers are INT_MAX  
OR  
lockTime has passed.  
  
I'm still of the opinion that non-final transactions shouldn't be broadcast
over the p2p network; I think the parties negotiating using them should keep
them to themselves until they are final, and broadcast then.
