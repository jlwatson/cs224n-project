That's code to parse JSONs. There's a Python library to work with JSON-RPC.  

Huh? See that 'import json' statement at the top? That would be the standard
(as of python 2.6) JSON parsing library.  
  
The code I posted tells the standard JSON parsing library to read JSON Numbers
as Decimal. If you are doing monetary calculations in python, then you should
be using Decimal. That is what it is for.
