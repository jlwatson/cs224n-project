Updated to release candidate 6:  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.4.1/test/  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.5.0/test/  
  
Two changes were made between rc5 and 6:  
1) When you encrypt your wallet for the first time, a new keypool is created
before Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind shuts down. This prevents losing bitcoins if you
backed up your newly-encrypted wallet, received coins to new addresses, and
then later restored from the backup.  
  
There is still a potential problem when you upgrade a previously-encrypted
wallet: in that case, the wallet file is rewritten on startup and will be left
with an empty keypool (new keys cannot be written because in this case the
code doesn't have your wallet passphrase). The release notes suggest backing
up the re-encrypted wallet after generating a new address.  
  
2) Be less aggressive about deleting the database/log.* file(s) on shutdown --
with rc6, they are only deleted if the wallet is successfully encrypted/re-
encrypted (to make sure unencrypted private keys are not left in them).  
  
Please report only show-stopper bugs in this thread-- normal bug reports or
feature suggestions should go into the github issue tracker:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues  
  
Please DO add to this thread if you've done some testing, giving what you
tested (0.4.1? 0.5.0 ? win32 exe ? zip ? linux ?), what operating system you
tested on, and if you were testing a fresh install or upgrading (and if
upgrading, was your wallet encrypted before?).
