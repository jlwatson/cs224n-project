I'm usually pretty careful not to call people names. Did I screw up?  
  
I DO think there are lots of crazy conspiracy theories. I might even believe
some of them myself, but that doesn't make me crazy (just "almost certainly
wrong.").  
  
RE: child exploitation: Good example. We all agree that child exploitation is
BAD, right?  
  
We might disagree about what (if anything) we should DO about it, but isn't it
worth discussing whether or not there is something we MIGHT do about it? For
example, maybe offering mostly-anonymous bounties to reward anybody who gives
information that leads to the arrest and conviction of people abusing children
for profit or pleasure is a good idea. Maybe those bounties could be paid in
Bitcoin.  
  
Maybe that is a terrible idea that will have awful consequences, but instead
of rational discussion there's a knee-jerk GOVERNMENT BAD! that, in my humble
opinion, is counter-productive to making the world a better place.  
  
I don't like people assuming that they know what I'm thinking, or assume that
because I'm willing to talk to people that I agree with those people, or
assume that because I'm pragmatic about regulation I "want regulation." For
the record: I'm mostly libertarian, I think we'd be just fine if we replaced
99.911% of regulations with voluntary, private, market-based solutions. But
that ain't gonna happen any time soon.
