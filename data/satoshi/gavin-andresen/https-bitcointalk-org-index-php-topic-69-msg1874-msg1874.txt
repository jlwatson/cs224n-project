I did some research into money exchanging and money transfer regulations in
the U.S.  
  
The raw legal code is online at:
http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_08/31cfr103_08.html  
  
I am not a lawyer; trying to understand legalese is just an odd hobby of mine.
From my reading of the regulations, if you exchange less than $1,000.USD worth
of Bitcoin per day you don't have to worry:  
  
  
It looks to me like if you exchanged more than $1,000.USD per day a good
lawyer might be able to argue that Bitcoins do not meet the legal definition
of "currency":  
  
Then again, if Bitcoins are not legally "currency" then it might be left up to
a Court to decide what, exactly, they are, and the result might be really
unpleasant (if a judge decided that they're like stocks and are therefore
subject to regulation by the Security and Exchange Commision you might find
yourself in jail for being an unlicensed stock broker).  
  
I think Bitcoin needs some licensed, regulated exchanges that abide by all the
regulations, treating Bitcoins just like another foreign currency, and make it
really easy to buy or sell a few hundred dollars worth of Bitcoins. The
regulations are not as onerous as I expected; basically you just have to get
identification from customers that make large transactions and report them.
