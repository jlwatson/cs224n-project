The only issues are 1) Balances in my P2SH Addresses don't show up, even
though the key to spend them is in the wallet and Bitcoin-QT sends
transactions from it just fine and they show up in listunspent (though I
certainly understand if it isn't in the first version), and 2) The display of
amounts seems to round to 4 decimal places, even when the actual amount is
something to the full 8 places.  

  
Thanks for helping test! Latest version fixes the p2sh issue.  
  
I had it 4-decimal-places because I personally don't care about less than
0.0001 BTC right now. It is 8 now, just because I know you won't be the last
person to ask "why does it round."

It does seem to have easy_install, but I got a "cannot import name
ServiceProxy" when I tried that.

  
If there are python command-line-tool packaging experts, suggestions on how to
package this better are welcome. I thought all versions of jsonrpc had a
ServiceProxy class, but I guess I'm wrong.
