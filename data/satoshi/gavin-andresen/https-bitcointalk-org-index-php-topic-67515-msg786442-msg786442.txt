But this would just affect the client program that users download, so some
people would be downloading some random program that could do harmful things
to their computer, yes?  

That is always a risk, which is why next to the downloads there is a gpg-
signed SHASUMS.asc file.  
  
To check the integrity of the download you should:  
  
\+ Check the signature on the SHASUMS.asc file:  

Code:

$ gpg --verify SHASUMS.asc  
gpg: Signature made Wed Feb 29 20:51:40 2012 EST using RSA key ID 1FC730C1  
gpg: Good signature from "Gavin Andresen (CODE SIGNING KEY)
<gavinandresen@gmail.com>"

\+ Make sure the checksum for the downloaded file matches the checksum in the
SHASUMS.asc file:  

Code:

$ shasum bitcoin-0.6.0rc2-macosx.dmg  
7ab035250ad32a95adf12f2bf8751df9adae0ad4 bitcoin-0.6.0rc2-macosx.dmg  
$ grep macosx SHASUMS.asc  
7ab035250ad32a95adf12f2bf8751df9adae0ad4 bitcoin-0.6.0rc2-macosx.dmg
