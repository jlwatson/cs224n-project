I've been thinking about splitting out the files, too. No functional changes,
just moving things around. I think that might help its adoption into the main
trunk.  

  
Somebody did that a few months ago (theres a message here in the forums
SOMEWHERE...)  
  
If I recall correctly, after he was done he found that it wouldn't compile on
Windows any more.
