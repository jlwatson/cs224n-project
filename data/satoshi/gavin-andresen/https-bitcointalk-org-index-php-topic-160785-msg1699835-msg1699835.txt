So.... move too fast and we maybe introduce a forking bug or a security
vulnerability.  
  
Move too slow and maybe we get fired-- somebody faster at incorporating safe
changes releases their own fork.  
  
For me, "move slow" is the right answer.  
  
But I would be completely happy contributing patches to somebody else running
a fork who solves the "move fast but be safe" problem.
