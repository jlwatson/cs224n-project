Alternative algorithms for determining the "best" block chain would be a good
research topic, I think.  
  
Model or simulate either a 'natural' block-chain splits (X% of the network
gets disconnected for time T) or attacks (attacker with 51+% of hashing rate
double-spends a transaction by surprising the network with a N-length better
block chain).  
  
Then see what the behavior is like under different potential algorithms for
determining the best chain-- the one we have now (most difficulty always wins)
or some variant (like more recent blocks are given greater weight).  
  
And think really hard about potential attacks, especially mixed-mode attacks
(what if the attacker can mount a Sybil attack on one of the big mining pools?
Or can DOS one or more of the big mining pools? etc)
