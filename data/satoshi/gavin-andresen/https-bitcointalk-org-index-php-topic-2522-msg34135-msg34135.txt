I'd love to see a pure-Javascript front-end GUI for bitcoind developed.  
  
I'm tempted to write one myself, but I've got a lot of other things on my TODO
list right now. Here's what I'm imagining:  
  
\+ Open source, pure JavaScript interface to bitcoin that communicates with a
running bitcoin/bitcoind using the JSON-RPC api.  
  
\+ Open up the index.html page that is the GUI and you'd be asked for the
host:port (default: localhost:8332), username and password.  
  
\+ From there, you'd have a nice Javascript/HTML GUI showing all your wallet
transactions (using RPC listtransactions).  
  
\+ And it'd show your default receiving address, have a Send Bitcoins button,
etc.  
  
\+ And it'd poll bitcoin/bitcoind every, oh, minute or so to look for new
transactions.  
  
I'm imagining shipping a webGUI/index.html (plus associated
CSS/javascript/etc) as part of the bitcoin(d) source package.
