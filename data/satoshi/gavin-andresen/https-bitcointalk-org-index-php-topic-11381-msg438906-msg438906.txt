I have trouble believing that you could get into legal trouble for having
illegal incidental data from legitimate activities on your computer. If you
_can_ , then we're all in trouble, because it is very easy to put illegal data
in your web browser's cache (JPEG and other image file formats let you store
arbitrary, not-normally-shown metadata, for example). I don't think it would
be hard to convince a jury that the block-chain is like your web browser's
cache-- full of lots of incidental stuff that is needed for the system to
work, but doesn't have anything to do with you. Now if you happen to have one
of the private keys involved in the illegal transactions, THEN you should go
directly to jail....  
  
Adding code to "shun" certain spend-able transactions wouldn't be hard,
although I think that's a bad idea for the same reason it is a bad idea to
respond to trolls on forums-- you'd just encourage the bad guys by drawing
attention to their misbehavior.
