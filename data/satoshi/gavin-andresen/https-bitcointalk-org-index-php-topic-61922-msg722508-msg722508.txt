BIP 16 (or 17) will not meet their initial "go/no-go" deadlines. You can see
the state of support here: http://blockchain.info/P2SH  
  
That's OK, that's why the deadlines were structured the way they are; in the
past, Satoshi made changes like this by simply changing the code and then
expecting everybody to upgrade. This is the first time we've used a more open,
community-driven process.  
  
So, since we'll miss the deadline, the question is: what next? To focus
discussion, here are two straw-man proposals that y'all can agree or disagree
with; I'll go along with whatever consensus arises over the next couple of
days:

On the subject of testing... I've created a wiki page to record QA (quality
assurance) testing that has been done on BIP 16. If you can help test, or have
been testing/deploying, then please add to this page:
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0016_QA  
  
As always, (on-topic) discussion, feedback, etc. is very welcome. If we can,
I'd like to move past the "we dont' need to do ANYTHING" arguments, there is
clearly rough consensus (with notable exceptions) that a short-bitcoin-address
solution is needed.
