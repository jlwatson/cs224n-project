OP_EVAL, and OP_EVAL-bitcoin-address support were pulled into the master git
branch two days ago; the plan is still to evaluate miner support on January
15, and if a majority of miners are supporting it (looks like that won't be a
problem), to roll out version 0.6 with the low-level support fully enabled.  
  
And Luke-Jr is correct: sending coins into an OP_EVAL transaction is perfectly
safe, but until February 1 it will be unsafe to spend them.
