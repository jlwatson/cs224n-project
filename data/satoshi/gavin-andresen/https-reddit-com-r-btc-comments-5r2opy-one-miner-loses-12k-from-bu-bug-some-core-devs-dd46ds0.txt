I have never said Bitcoin is broken.

I will continue to be critical of the Core implementation's priorities and culture since I stepped down as long as I think those priorities and culture are harmful to Bitcoin.

Part of the broken culture is an inability to react maturely to criticism, or to acknowledge that reasonable people can disagree about priorities.
