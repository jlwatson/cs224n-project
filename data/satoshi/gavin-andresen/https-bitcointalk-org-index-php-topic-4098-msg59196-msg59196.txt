  
500MB per connection times 100 connections would be 50 GB. That re-opens the
door to a memory exhaustion denial-of-service attack, which is the problem
-maxsendbuffer fixes.  
  
As transaction volume grows I think there will be lots of things that need
optimization/fixing. One simple fix would be to request fewer blocks as they
get bigger, to stay inside the sendbuffer limit...  
  
(ps: I've been re-downloading the current block chain connected to a
-maxsendbuffer=10000 0.3.20 node, and the workaround works)
