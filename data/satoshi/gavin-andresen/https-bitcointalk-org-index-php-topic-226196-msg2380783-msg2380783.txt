Thoughts?  

  
This gives me warm fuzzies; a University of Chicago professor speculating
about how a wildly successful Bitcoin might affect the International Monetary

I don't really care what is said, just the fact that Bitcoin is being talked
about in the elite Ivory Towers is a very good thing.
