The dreaded DB_RUNRECOVERY... that's usually caused by running an older
version of BDB (0.6 is compiled against BDB 4.8) on a datadir written with a
newer version of BDB.  
  
Recovery isn't hard; just delete the .bitcoin/database/log.000* file(s) and
any .bitcoin/__db*.log files. Were you previously running a self-compiled
version of Bitcoin?  
  
From http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#divining-bdb-version :  

Code:

cd ~/.bitcoin/database  
od -j12 -N8 -tx4 log.000*

  
... will show what version of BDB the log files were written with.
