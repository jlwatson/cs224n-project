A client that connects up, subscribes, and then gets updates as they happen
might be an easier start.  

  
Connects via another port?  
  
Or would you teach bitcoin's minimal http implementation to keep the
connection open? (and service multiple connections at once)  
  
I've got a use case (google App Engine) where a persistent connection to
bitcoin isn't possible (App Engine apps can fetch URLs, and can act as 'web
hooks', but can't just open a socket and listen).
