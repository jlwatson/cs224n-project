May I ask why wasn't the new language pt_PT included in the release?  

Because when I was a young child a Portuguese family lived across the street
from me and their oldest child bullied me mercilessly, making fun of my
haircut and my funny Australian accent.

Somebody to do translation quality assurance is a great idea. Want to
volunteer?
