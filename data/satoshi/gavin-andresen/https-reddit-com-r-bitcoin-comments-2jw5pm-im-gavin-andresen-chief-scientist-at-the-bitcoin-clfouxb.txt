RE: paying me directly: there is a well-worn path for getting a paycheck that is easy to explain to the IRS.

If I got a bunch of money from random people on the Internet, I'm not sure how I'd explain that income to the IRS. I _am_ sure I don't want to think about it, so I prefer getting paid in the mostly-traditional way.

Thanks for the compliment!
