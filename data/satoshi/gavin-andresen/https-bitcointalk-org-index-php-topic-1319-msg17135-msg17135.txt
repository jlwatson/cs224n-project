My preferred arrangement would be a 'monitorall' command, which POSTs each
incoming transaction to a URL, regardless of bitcoinaddress, as long as it's a
wallet transaction.

I agree. A "monitorall" command would be quite useful.  

Pass "allwallet" to monitoraddress and you'll get all transactions that put
coins in your wallet.  
  
RE: getting the data POSTed in PHP: Try:  
  
json_string = http_get_request_body();  
  
Also, POSTing to www.postbin.org (create a postbin there first) is really
useful for debugging.
