This is where I think maybe a standard https-based protocol might work nicely,
so the same address shortening services can be used either in the bitcoin
client and for online e-wallets.  
  
Something simple, like user says "Please use these services for resolving
addresses:  
https://bitdex.net/resolve  
https://btcquick.com/resolve  
https://mtgox.com/finduser  
"  
  
Protocol could just be POST the text the user types into the address field and
get back JSON with a bitcoin address and maybe some extra information to
reassure the user that they're paying gavin@acm.org "Gavin Andresen (my
picture) (my gpg key fingerprint)" and not gaven@acm.org "Gaven Smith (some
other guy's picture) (no gpg key fingerprint)" ...
