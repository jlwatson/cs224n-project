ok... Help me understand just one of those: consumer surplus (because i am a consumer, so that should be easy for me to understand).

I pay $11 for something now, but I would be willing to pay $12. I get $1 of consumer surplus.

If I have to pay $11.01, I will still buy it, I will just be less happy about it.

And I have 1 cent less to spend on something else.

If I everybody makes minimum wage, then it is all zero-sum, yes? Everybody makes more wages but gets the same net amount of consumer surplus.

What happens if most min wage consumers are richer than min wage workers? I think that just works out to a wealth transfer from rich to poor, yes?

ARE most consumers of min wage services richer than average? What if the opposite is true?
