  
Because I want to enable these features reasonably soon, and modifying the way
CHECKSIG works means a blockchain fork for clients that haven't upgraded.
Which means giving at least 6 months notice to give everybody time to upgrade
their clients.  
  
At some point that will make sense, but with what I'm proposing it is not
necessary. When SHA3 is finalized or a weakness is found in ECDSA or SHA256
maybe it'll be time to do that...
