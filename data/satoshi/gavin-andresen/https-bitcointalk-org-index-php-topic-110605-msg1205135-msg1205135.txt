gavin i'm sure you know how to use a virtual machine to run older versions of
osx right?  

I'm sure I could figure it out, but I don't have a copy of osx 10.5 to run,
won't pirate it, and don't feel like spending $60 to pick up a copy on Ebay.
I'd rather not spend the half a day it would take me to set up a development
environment in a VM, too....
