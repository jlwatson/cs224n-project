Golly, journeyofrivers is really going to hate me when he finds out I'm an
Elected Official and a Cog in the System. Last night I voted to steal millions
of dollars from taxpayers and give it to public (I know! Terrible!) schools.  
  
(I'm only barely an elected official, one of 251 elected Amherst Town Meeting
members. My punishment is long boring meetings late at night a couple times a
year...)  
  
Seriously, we probably agree on most things on a philosophical level. I just
believe I'll get farther by taking "small steps to a much better world."
