RE: seeds with a lot of entropy:  
  
Every time I look at the academic literature on passwords/passphrases, I get
more depressed about the feasibility of either giving users a secure
passphrase that they will remember or getting a secure passphrase from them. I
fear there will be a lot of lost coins if "brain wallets" get popular.  
  
E.g. this 2012 paper: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2335356.2335366

Users tend to create passwords that are easy to guess, while system assigned
passwords tend to be hard to remember. Passphrases, space-delimited sets of
natural language words, have been suggested as both secure and usable for
decades. In a 1,476-participant online study, we explored the usability of 3-
and 4-word system-assigned passphrases in comparison to system-assigned
passwords composed of 5 to 6 random characters, and 8-character system
assigned pronounceable passwords. Contrary to expectations, system-assigned
passphrases performed similarly to system-assigned passwords of similar
entropy across the usability metrics we examined. Passphrases and passwords
were forgotten at similar rates, led to similar levels of user difﬁculty and
annoyance, and were both written down by a majority of participants. However,
passphrases took signiﬁcantly longer for participants to enter, and appear to
require error-correction to counteract entry mistakes. Passphrase usability
did not seem to increase when we shrunk the dictionary from which words were
chosen, reduced the number of words in a passphrase, or allowed users to
change the order of words
