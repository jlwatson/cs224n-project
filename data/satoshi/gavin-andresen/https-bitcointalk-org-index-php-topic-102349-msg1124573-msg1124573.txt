RE: seeds with a lot of entropy:  
  
Every time I look at the academic literature on passwords/passphrases, I get
more depressed about the feasibility of either giving users a secure
passphrase that they will remember or getting a secure passphrase from them. I
fear there will be a lot of lost coins if "brain wallets" get popular.  
  
E.g. this 2012 paper: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2335356.2335366
