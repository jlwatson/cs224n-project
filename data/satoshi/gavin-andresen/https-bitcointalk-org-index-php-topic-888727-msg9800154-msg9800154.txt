why is that illegal to run bitcoin exchange? its not real money  

It's being exchanged for real money. Therefore, according to the law in
Illinois, you have to have a Money Service Business license or face felony
charges.  

  
I am not a lawyer, but...  
... the money transmission laws and regulations are written very broadly. They
almost certainly apply even if you are exchanging one crypto-currency for
another, and no "real money" is involved.  
  
The only saving grace is that the laws only apply if you are operating "a
business" -- so occasional lowish-value person-to-person exchanges done as a
favor to friends at no markup from the current exchange rate is probably
perfectly legal.
