Using bitcoind on a command-line? What operating system?  
  
Something is stripping off the double-quotes from the "txid" and "vout" keys
before it gets to bitcoind. If you're using bash on linux, then put single
quotes around the arguments. Like this:  
  

Code:

createrawtransaction
'[{"txid":eb63d5d53cd906b5cf75a014e1bcf1c0198ae58d378d45dbfa15045ac89a38ac,"vout":0}]'
'{"1FQvMNzFJRf2nFJbhri2pWEVMqTtdLSCmA":23.36129790}'

  
I also corrected the second argument, the address is a string (strings in JSON
are always "whatever") and the amount is decimal number-of-bitcoins.
