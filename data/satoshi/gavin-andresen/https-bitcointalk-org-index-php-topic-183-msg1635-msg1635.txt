nice service, but there was a problem with my first attempt to get the coins:
"invalid BC address".  
So the first address generated by the bitcoin program didn't work -
1Dn51Rn2tmvARcsYkPe7Aw1sCAXw5oKnR  

That's caused by a bug in one of the technologies I'm using behind the scenes
(Google's App Engine). If you try again the problem should go away.  
  
I've got a couple of ideas on how to make it more reliable, but I'm still
hoping Google finds and fixes the underlying problem...
