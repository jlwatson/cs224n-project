  
Why the change: because it is twice as fast to compile just 32-bit, a 32-bit-
only executable is smaller and faster to download, and there is no advantage
to running 64-bit (bitcoin doesn't need more than 4 gigabytes of memory, there
are no performance-critical routines that would be faster running 64-bit,
etc).  
  
If there's a good reason to compile 64-bit, or if we ever drop support for
32-bit Macs then a 64-bit version would make sense.
