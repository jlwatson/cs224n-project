But what about when Bitcoin is being considered by people in poverty as a
means to pull themselves up by their boot straps? What about when it is being
talked about in every highschool in the country, and kids too young to work
and not computer literate enough to mine want to get them?  
  
The answer will be "Alt-coins".  

  
I don't follow. Where does the real-world wealth come from? What will those
pull-up-by-their-own-bootstraps people be doing that makes the world a better
place and makes them wealthier?  
  
I suspect you might be confusing "money" with "wealth."
