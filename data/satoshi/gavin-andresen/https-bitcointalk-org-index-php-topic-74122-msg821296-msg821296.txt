Ummm...  
  
You know when you choose "About Bitcoin-Qt" and it says "Version 0.something
BETA" ?  
  
When we've got an implementation that is safe and secure (both from hackers
and from accidental loss) out of the box that will change to say "Bitcoin
Version 1.something".  
  
Unfortunately, I don't know how to launch Bitcoin in an alternate universe
where it will be attacked by highly motivated black-hats and then bring back
the battle-tested source code to this universe to be launched as a perfectly
secure Version One.  
  
So, to repeat myself: Bitcoin is experimental software. Do not invest time or
money in it that you cannot afford to lose.
