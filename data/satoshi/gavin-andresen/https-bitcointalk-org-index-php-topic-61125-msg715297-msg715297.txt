(but Gavin attacked me too while I did nothing wrong).  

I apologize-- I did not mean to attack you, I thought I stated nothing but
facts. I am also sorry I didn't speak up about some of the things that were
said about you earlier in this thread (e.g. suggesting an attack on your pool
is NOT cool) but I don't have time to read every forum post as soon as it is
posted...
