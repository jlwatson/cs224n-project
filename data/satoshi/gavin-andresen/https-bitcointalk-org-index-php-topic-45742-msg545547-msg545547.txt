I pulled Bitcoin QT into the master branch of
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/ this morning.  
  
See doc/readme-qt.rst for instructions on building Bitcoin QT.  
  
And I updated doc/build-*.txt; they are now instructions for building bitcoind
and don't mention wxwidgets at all.  
  
There are still loose ends to tie up, like modifying the build scripts and the
windows installer; I hope to tie those up in the next week or so, and have a
release candidate for a version 0.5 available soon.
