RE: changing the confusing transaction fee message: good idea, and yes, "we"
can.  
  
How about:  
  
This transaction requires a transaction fee of at least 0.0N because of its
amount, complexity, or use of recently received funds  
  
  
I don't want to use the word "recommend", because the GUI doesn't let you try
to send them without a fee.
