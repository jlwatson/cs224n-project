  
Yes, I believe they would. So far, most miners and pools are VERY
conservative; I think the idea that they will create huge blocks that have a
significant risk of being rejected, just so they MIGHT get an advantage over
marginal miners that can't process them fast enough, is loony.  
  
But I might be wrong.  
  
So I'd like to wait a little while, think deeply some more, and see how miners
and merchants and users react with the system we've got as transaction volume
increases.
