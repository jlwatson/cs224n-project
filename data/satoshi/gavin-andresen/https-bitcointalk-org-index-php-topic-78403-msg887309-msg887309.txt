Miners won't switch to a 51% chain if it means they can't cash out the coins
they're creating!  
  
The attack we're talking about is "51% attacker refuses to include anybody
else's transactions in their blocks." And newly generated coins are useless to
miners if they can't get transactions that spend them into the block chain....
