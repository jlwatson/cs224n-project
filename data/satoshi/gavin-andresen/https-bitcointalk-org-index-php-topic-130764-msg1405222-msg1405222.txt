Double-spends have always been possible. That's why we count "confirmations".
The number of confirmations reduces the risk of double-spends.  

Yes -- 0/1-confirmation double spends are certainly possible. A successful
2-confirmation double-spend would be more interesting. I would love to see if
real-network experience matches the theoretical results from Meni's paper.
