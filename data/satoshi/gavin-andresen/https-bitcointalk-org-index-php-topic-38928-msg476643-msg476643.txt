  
Clients could make c the base for a deterministic key; derive a series of keys
from c, and use them in subsequent transactions. (given full public key for c,
you can derive a series of public keys without having the private key)  
  
Same could be done for the 'wallet protection service' key b -- every time you
use b, contact the protection service and ask for a b' derived
deterministically from b. Then b'', b''', etc...
