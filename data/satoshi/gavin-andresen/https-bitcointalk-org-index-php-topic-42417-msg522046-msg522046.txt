RE: where in the code: script.cpp  
  

Code:

static const size_t nMaxNumSize = 4;  
  
  
CBigNum CastToBigNum(const valtype& vch)  
{  
if (vch.size() > nMaxNumSize)  
throw runtime_error("CastToBigNum() : overflow");  
// Get rid of extra leading zeros  
return CBigNum(CBigNum(vch).getvch());  
}  
  

... and all of the arithmetic binary ops do a CastToBigNum()  
  
nMaxNumSize = 4 means numbers added must be 32-bits or less.  
  
RE: simpler version being redeemed by anybody by rewriting: D'oh! Right,
definitely need a signature so the transaction can't be modified between being
broadcast and being included in a block. I'll remove it from the wiki page.
