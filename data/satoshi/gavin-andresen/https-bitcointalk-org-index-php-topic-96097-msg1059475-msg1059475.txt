Good question.  
  
In my humble opinion, the block size should not be arbitrarily limited as it
is now (1MB is the limit; typical blocks these days are 30-250K big), but
should 'float' -- miners should collectively decide how large a block they're
willing to validate and build on top of.  
  
Obviously a miner wants to include as many fee-paying transactions in their
blocks as possible, until the fee paid is less than their cost of validating
and including the transaction (which is a small cost).  
  
But miners also don't want to spend a very long time validating other miners'
blocks, so they have an incentive to ignore blocks that are outrageously big.
If they _were_ willing to build on a 10-gigabyte-big block that took ten
minutes to download and signature check, then they're shooting themselves in
the foot-- an evil miner could mine a huge block, and then get a head start on
mining the next block while the rest of the network was busy validating it.  
  
BUT: moving to a floating maximum block size determined by miners will be
really hard; it will require everybody-- merchants and miners and users-- to
upgrade. It may never happen, because other ways of supporting very high
transaction volumes might develop before then.
