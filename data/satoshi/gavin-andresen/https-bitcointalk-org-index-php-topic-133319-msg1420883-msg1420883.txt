I sent ShadowOfHarbringer's some of my thoughts on this in this private
message:  
  
I don't worry much right now about economically irrational, "I'm going to
spend millions of dollars to disrupt the bitcoin network" attacks because I
don't think anybody is going to spend millions of dollars to disrupt our tiny
payment network.  
  
I have no idea what bitcoin payments will look like in 5-10 years; I expect
all sorts of trust mechanisms and relationships to develop that are
independent of the bitcoin network, and I suspect some of those will make 51%
attacks irrelevant.  
  
And I have no idea what the mining landscape will look like in 5-10 years; if
thousands of companies around the world are installing bitcoin mining hardware
for free in every house built in cold climates (generate bitcoins and get a
discount on your heating bill) then it may be completely inconceivable for
even a government to amass enough hashing power to mount a 51% attack.  
  
So while I encourage y'all to keep thinking about it as an interesting
theoretical problem, it is only slightly higher on my personal priority list
than worrying about quantum computers breaking ECDSA.
