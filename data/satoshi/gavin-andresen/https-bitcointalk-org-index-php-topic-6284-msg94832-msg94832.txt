You are forgetting that there are (at least) three players in the bitcoin
economy: miners, users... and merchants.  
  
If transaction fees are driven to zero so miners start dropping out, then
merchants have an incentive to step in and start mining themselves so their
transactions get processed in a timely manner. Otherwise they don't get paid.
