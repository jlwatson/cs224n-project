Gavin already gave his talk to the CIA, and he agreed to not talk about what
happened there...  

No, that is not true.  
  
The only condition of my visit to the CIA was that I not use the fact that I
visited there in any type of advertising.  
  
Well, that and to abide by their normal security while I was there: no cell
phone or other electronic devices allowed, no trying to wander off by myself
unescorted.  
  
I am completely free to talk about what happened, and if you buy me a beer
sometime I'd be happy to answer any questions you have. Just not here, too
many trolls and I've already spent too much time before and after the trip
trying (and failing) to keep the conspiracy theories in check.
