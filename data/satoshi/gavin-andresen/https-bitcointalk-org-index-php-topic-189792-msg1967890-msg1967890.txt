My reaction: stop spreading FUD.  
  
"small mining pools will go out of business" -- give me a break! My back-of-
the-envelope calculations say that anybody willing to spend a few hundred
dollars a year on a dedicated server with a high-bandwidth connection can
support a MUCH, MUCH larger block size.  
  
The block size will be raised. Your video will just make a lot of people
worried about nothing, in exactly the same way Luke-Jr's BIP17 proposal last
year (and his hyperbolic rhetoric about BIP16) did nothing but cause a tempest
in a teapot.
