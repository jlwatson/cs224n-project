Another "Troll" here:  
  
On the minus side of the ledger, Gavin omitted to mention the X.509 privacy-
destroying functionality for the unaware that has been implemented as the
default behavior of the "payment protocol" in 0.9 clients.  

  
I'll break my rule about feeding trolls again to debunk for about the
hundredth time the myth that the use of X.509 certificates in the payment
protocol is bad for privacy.  
  
It is not.  
  
If you are in a customer/merchant situation, the customer's privacy is not
affected AT ALL. The merchant's identity is in the X.509 certificate, the
customer is as anonymous as always (which is very often "not anonymous",
because the merchant needs to know something about the customer to deliver
their product).  
  
If you are a merchant, then part of the PURPOSE of the payment protocol is to
provide a cryptographically secure, verified-in-some-way identity.  
  
If you are a merchant and want an pseudanonymous then that is easy: set up an
anonymous email address and then get a free email certificate from any of the
certificate authorities that provide them.  
  
If you have a philosophical hatred of X.509 and certificate authorities...
then please invent a better identity verification system and get the world to
adopt it. The payment protocol is specifically designed to make it easy to
slide in a better system.  
  
(but if you have a philosophical hatred of X.509 then what are you doing
posting here at bitcointalk, whose security relies on the very X.509
certificates you find so despicable? There ARE alternatives, you should go
hang out in forums.i2p or a Tor-based forum...)
