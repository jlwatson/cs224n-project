I just submitted a pull request to fix this:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1818  
  

Quote

This pull request makes three functional changes:  
  

  * Adds "redeemScript" to listunspent output, when listing a p2sh/multisig output
  * Adds "redeemScript" to signrawtransaction's second argument (list of previous transaction outputs)
  * Adds a new RPC command, "createmultisig" that is just like "addmultisigaddress" but instead of adding the multisig address/redeemScript to the wallet, returns them in a JSON object.

  
It also includes new unit tests for the raw transaction API argument checking
code (and refactors some argument checking to remove some code duplication).
