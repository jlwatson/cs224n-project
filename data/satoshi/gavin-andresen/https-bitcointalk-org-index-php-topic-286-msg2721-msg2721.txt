And I expect most of us will be running lightweight clients that just keep our
wallets, sign transactions, and send and receive transactions to the ultra-
fast nodes that ARE looking at every transaction.  

  
Is this possible? What would this look like? From a technical perspective what
does a "lightweight client" look like for you? My understanding is that the
Bitcoin client needs the entire block chain in order to establish trust.  

I'm imagining:  
  
A lightweight client would have a wallet with coins in it (public+private key
pairs).  
  
And a secure way of sending messages to, and getting messages from, any of the
ultra-fast, always-connected heavyweight nodes.  
  
The lightweight client sends money by:  
creating a transaction (signing coins with the private key)  
sending the signed transaction securely to the ultra-fast server, which puts
it on the network.  
receiving confirmation that the transaction was valid and sent, and updating
its wallet (marks coins as spent)  
(or getting a "you already spent those coins" error from the server)  
  
The lightweight client receives money by:  
Either polling the server every once in a while, asking "Any payments to these
BC addresses that I have in my wallet?"  
... or asking the server to tell it whenever it sees a transaction to a list
of BC addresses (or maybe when it sees  
a relevant transaction with N confirmations)  
When transactions occur, the lightweight client updates its wallet (adds the
coins).  
  
You don't have to trust the server; it never has your private keys.  
  
Well, you do have to trust that the server doesn't lie about whether your
transactions are valid or not, but why would the server lie about that?
