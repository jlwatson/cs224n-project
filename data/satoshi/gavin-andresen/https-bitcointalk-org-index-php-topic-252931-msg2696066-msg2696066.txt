Nice work!  
  
RE: gcc creating different binaries:  
  
The gitian build does two main things to make builds reproducible:  
  
1\. Uses libfaketime.so so all calls to time()/etc during compilation return
the same time.  
(I don't know if it is the compiler, linker, or archiver that likes to put
timestamps in binaries)  
  
2\. Passes -frandom-seed=constant to g++, so it doesn't create random names
for generated methods.
