Testing changes to Bitcoin-Qt continues to be a chronic problem, and as
alternative implementations of Bitcoin start to mature testing to make sure
that they interoperate correctly and don't harm the network will become a big
problem.  
  
Therefore, I'm creating a decentralized, transparent organization using the
BetterMeans system. I'll need help from people willing to be fundraisers,
testers, project managers, toolmakers, troll-catchers, etc.  
  
I'll create and hold a secure wallet that will be used for donations (at least
until the project gets mature enough to turn over that responsibility to
somebody else), but we'll use the BetterMeans "Credits" system so that
everybody working on the project collaboratively decides who gets what, and
what the priorities aught to be.  
  
So: it is easy to talk about stuff like this, who's willing to help make it
happen? Send me an email at gavinandresen@gmail.com if this sounds like a
project you'd like to help with, describing what you think the highest
priorities for the project aught to be, how you could contribute, how much
time you could contribute per week, and any relevant prior experience.
