The micro transaction fee only applies to the the 'out' side.  

Right, but every TxIn has to have a corresponding TxOut (except for
GENERATE/coinbase transactions, but those have their own rules). So if you
want a 0 BTC TxIn, you've gotta first pay yourself with a 0BTC TxOut and
that'll trigger the fee. TxIns don't contain a value, the value is in the
corresponding TxOut...

Anyone who is accepting 'bad' transactions and returning good coins deserves
to give their money away.  

  
But you agree that it wouldn't be OK for a 'refundtransaction' API call to
make it easy to do that, right?
