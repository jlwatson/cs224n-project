Right, but every TxIn has to have a corresponding TxOut (except for
GENERATE/coinbase transactions, but those have their own rules). So if you
want a 0 BTC TxIn, you've gotta first pay yourself with a 0BTC TxOut and
that'll trigger the fee. TxIns don't contain a value, the value is in the
corresponding TxOut...  
  
  
But you agree that it wouldn't be OK for a 'refundtransaction' API call to
make it easy to do that, right?
