The Tor project has stats. E.g. see:
  https://metrics.torproject.org/torperf.html?graph=torperf&start=2014-11-12&end=2015-02-10&source=all&filesize=5mb

... which implies it would take anywhere from 40 seconds to two minutes to download 20MB.

So WITHOUT ANY OPTIMIZATIONS AT ALL, that is too slow to mine-- you'll have a high orphan rate if it takes 1 or 2 minutes for you to find out about a new 20MB block. Although if the entire network was forced to work through Tor that wouldn't matter, since everybody would have higher orphan rates.

Once block propagation is optimized not to retransmit all transaction data, the orphan problem goes away, and yes, should be perfectly reasonable to run a full node in the Tor network.
