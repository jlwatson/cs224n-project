Character set issues give me headaches.  
  
So I just ran a test at the command-line, moving 500 testnet bitcoins to an
account named "à¸¿"  
  
The account created is named "\u00E0\u00B8\u00BF", which is not what I
intended. E0 B8 BF is the utf-8 representation of the unicode Thai Baht
character.  
  
Thinking this through, trying hard not to get a headache...  
  
My terminal window has: LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8  
So when I copy&paste the Thai baht symbol, it is being encoded as UTF-8.  
  
I pass a UTF-8 string to bitcoind, and it uses the JSON-Spirit library to
convert it into a JSON string (which is defined to be Unicode... encoded using
backslashes, I think: see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt ). And there's
the bug. Maybe. I think?  
  
Command-line bitcoind should be looking at the locale and converting JSON
strings to/from that locale. Anybody motivated enough about internationalized
account names (and send comments) to teach it to do that?
