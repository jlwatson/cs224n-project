They key bits of code are:  

Code:

fileout << FLATDATA(pchMessageStart) << nSize;  
...  
fileout << *this;

pchMessageStart are the four magic bytes, and those are written with FLATDATA.  
  
The CBlock itself is written by << *this, and that's done by the
IMPLEMENT_SERIALIZE in main.h:  

Code:

IMPLEMENT_SERIALIZE  
(  
READWRITE(this->nVersion);  
nVersion = this->nVersion;  
READWRITE(hashPrevBlock);  
READWRITE(hashMerkleRoot);  
READWRITE(nTime);  
READWRITE(nBits);  
READWRITE(nNonce);  
  
// ConnectBlock depends on vtx being last so it can calculate offset  
if (!(nType & (SER_GETHASH|SER_BLOCKHEADERONLY)))  
READWRITE(vtx);  
else if (fRead)  
const_cast<CBlock*>(this)->vtx.clear();  
)  

  
The READWRITE macros Do The Right Thing, reading in or writing out the members
in a machine-independent way.  
  
See http://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcointools for simplified Python code
that can dump out transactions and blocks.
