And second, even if it did, there are bigger powers out there that you need to
convince - how are you planing to do that, when obviously there already are
people who are convincing them otherwise?  

  
Which "bigger powers" and which "people" ?  
  
Is there some secret cabal out there I don't know about?  
  
If you mean "Peter Todd has convinced some big mining pool operators not to
increase the size of the blocks they create" -- then great! That's the free
market at work, big mining pools should be free to create blocks that are as
large or as small as they like, and to accept or reject other's blocks for
whatever reason they like.
