  
Pieter and Wladimir are not US citizens, so a US judge can't order them to do
anything.  
  
If I was ordered to insert a backdoor, I'd just resign as lead developer and
find something else to work on.  
  
But this whole scenario sounds like a paranoid delusion; has there EVER been a
case where a judge has ordered a software developer to do anything other than
stop distributing their software (because of some copyright or patent issue) ?
