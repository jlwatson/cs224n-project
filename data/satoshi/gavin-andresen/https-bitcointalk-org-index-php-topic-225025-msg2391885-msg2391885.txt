Let's say the IRS wants to be able to confiscate bitcoins from tax evaders. So
they go to the US courts to get this. A judge ends up ordering the bitcoin.org
dev team to include a government backdoor so the IRS can take funds away from
those who don't pay taxes.  
  
The devs would be forced to comply right?  

  
Pieter and Wladimir are not US citizens, so a US judge can't order them to do
anything.  
  
If I was ordered to insert a backdoor, I'd just resign as lead developer and
find something else to work on.  
  
But this whole scenario sounds like a paranoid delusion; has there EVER been a
case where a judge has ordered a software developer to do anything other than
stop distributing their software (because of some copyright or patent issue) ?
