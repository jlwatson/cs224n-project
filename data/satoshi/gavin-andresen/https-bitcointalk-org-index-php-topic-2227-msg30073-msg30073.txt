  
Did you simulate network connectivity at all? Bitcoin is a semi-randomly
connected network, where most of the connections are (I would guess) outbound
connections from non-generating nodes who are sitting behind firewalls. With a
typical node having 8 random connections, to different /16 networks, it seems
to me it would be pretty tough to get tight-enough control over enough network
connections to consistently win the "announce a new block" race.  
  
Anybody know how to estimate what percentage of connections the cartel would
have to control to only lose the announce-a-block race 15% of the time? It'll
be way more than 15%....
