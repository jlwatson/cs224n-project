The only rule oddity in the simulator is: when the Network (all those who are
not the cartel) solves a hash, it is not credited a mined block if the
preceding block was mined by the cartel. (In this case, the cartel would use
its superior network connectivity to "override" the network's newly mined
block with the cartel's previously mined block).  

  
Did you simulate network connectivity at all? Bitcoin is a semi-randomly
connected network, where most of the connections are (I would guess) outbound
connections from non-generating nodes who are sitting behind firewalls. With a
typical node having 8 random connections, to different /16 networks, it seems
to me it would be pretty tough to get tight-enough control over enough network
connections to consistently win the "announce a new block" race.  
  
Anybody know how to estimate what percentage of connections the cartel would
have to control to only lose the announce-a-block race 15% of the time? It'll
be way more than 15%....
