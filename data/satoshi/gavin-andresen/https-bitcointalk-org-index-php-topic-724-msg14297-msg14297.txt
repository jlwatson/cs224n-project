blkindex.dat contains all the transactions, in records that look like:  
key: "tx" + HASH_OF_TRANSACTION  
value: serialized CTxIndex  
  
The CTxIndex points to a record in one of the blk000n.dat files.  
  
That does bring up an interesting point, though: if lightweight clients are
implemented, they wouldn't be able to support an arbitrary 'gettransaction'.
