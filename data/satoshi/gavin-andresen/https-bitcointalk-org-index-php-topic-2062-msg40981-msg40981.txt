CPUID returns information in eax, ebx, ecx, and edx. With -fPIC you have to
push ebx onto the stack before calling cpuid and pop it afterward as Bin
points out is what the patch to xen-unstable does.  

The compiler used to generate the push/pop just fine for gcc-3.3. This is an
issue specific to gcc-3.4.  

  
Unless somebody volunteers to fix/maintain this, I'm inclined to simply remove
all of the "try to make the CPU miner go faster" optimizations from bitcoin.
CPU mining is, for most people, a waste of electricity.
