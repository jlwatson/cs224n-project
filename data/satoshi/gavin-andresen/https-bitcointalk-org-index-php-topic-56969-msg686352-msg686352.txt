  
No, not "something else", it is "if you see this very-specific sequence of
bytes in the scriptPubKey then do this ADDITIONAL validation."  
  
As for saying something in BIP 16 about obsoleting scriptPubKey : no. Although
I think in the future we'll move towards all transactions being pay-to-script-
hash, I think it is dumb to put anything like "we think this is what is going
to happen in the future" into standards documents.  
  
Can we keep the big picture in mind? The reason I'm pushing so hard for "send
bitcoins to a multisignature-protected-address" functionality is so users stop
losing their bitcoins to malware infecting their computers and smartphones and
to scammers.  
  
We can spend more months arguing over trivia, but I would much rather we spent
the time thinking hard about, and building, great wallet and escrow solutions
that solve Bitcoin's biggest technical problems.
