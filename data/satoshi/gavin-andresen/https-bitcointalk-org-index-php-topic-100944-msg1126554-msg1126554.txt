... the implementation could have easily been written to use a previously
"labelled" address as the only input address for a "sendfrom" without changing
the _purpose_ at all. I assume the reason it wasn't done this way was to keep
the pseudo-anonymity as strong as possible (which is something completely
unlike the way any normal accounting works).  

  
No, the main reason isn't anonymity the reason is so transferring bitcoins
between accounts using 'move' doesn't require a blockchain transaction.
