  
I think this is exactly the right thing to do.  
  
There is still the question of what the default behavior should be. Here is a
proposal:  
  
Ignore blocks that take your node longer than N seconds to verify.  
  
I'd propose that N be: 60 seconds if you are catching up with the blockchain.
5 seconds if you are all caught-up. But allow miners/merchants/users to easily
change those defaults.  
  
Rationale: we should use time-to-verify as the metric, because everything
revolves around the 10-minutes-per-block constant.  
  
Time-to-verify has the nice property of scaling as hardware gets more
powerful. Miners will want to create blocks that take a reasonable amount of
time to propagate through the network and verify, and will have to weigh "add
more transactions to blocks" versus "if I add too many, my block will be
ignored by more than half the network."  
  
Time-to-verify also has the nice property of incentivizing miners to broadcast
transactions instead of 'hoarding' them, because transactions that are
broadcast before they are in a block make the block faster to verify (because
of the signature cache). That is good for lots of reasons (early detection of
potential double-spends and spreading out the verification work over time so
there isn't a blizzard of CPU work that needs to be done every time a block is
found, for example).
