Wasn't me. I don't remember Satoshi ever writing something like that, but I'm
really good at forgetting things.  
  
I agree with ribuck, if we ever need more than 21quadrillion bit-atoms,
encoding more using the unused high bits in the 64-bit number will work
nicely.  
  
That would be a very nice problem to have.
