I've been making slow but steady progress on my at-the-network-level testing
tool. [...]  
  
What's working: python-based code that serializes/deserializes messages in
both bitcoin's binary format (to talk to the node being tested) and JSON (so
it is easy for us humans to tweak/examine test data). Connecting and
requesting all blocks.  

  
Where can I get my hands on that? I was looking for something like this for a
long while.

Start with dumpblocks.py
