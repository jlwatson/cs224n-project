  
But how do you know that the transaction the hardware device signed is
actually the transaction you wanted to make? You might THINK you're sending
100BTC to your brother, your computer will SAY you're sending 100BTC to your
brother, but the trojan might change the destination address that goes in to
the hardware device.  
  
Unless the hardware device has some sort of display and physical button to OK
the transaction. In which case the hardware device sounds a lot like a smart
phone.
