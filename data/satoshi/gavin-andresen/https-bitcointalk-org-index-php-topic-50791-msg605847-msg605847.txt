0.5.0 is next; just working out the last build/deploy issues now...  
  
A day or two after a release is final I always bump the third version number,
so somebody running "git head" (the latest source code) has a newer version
number. So there _was_ a 0.4.1 that was never released; the switch to Qt for
the graphical UI was a big enough change to justify a jump to version 0.5
