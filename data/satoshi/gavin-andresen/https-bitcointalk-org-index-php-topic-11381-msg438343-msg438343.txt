Putting illegal content in the block chain and announcing it as an attempt to
undermine Bitcoin seems like a good way to get yourself arrested. Much better
than tweeting about exploits.  
  
You'll have both law enforcement and techies trying to track you down, and
given that people are already deploying de-anonymizing tools it seems pretty
darn likely that you'd get caught.
