I'm a happy LastPass subscriber... and I hate to say it, but they're right. At
this point there's no way the average consumer will use Bitcoin, even via a
website like mybitcoin.com.  
  
I think it will be a few years before bitcoin and bitcoin-related services are
reliable and trustworthy enough for the average consumer. Don't get me wrong,
I think bitcoin is a fantastic idea and has a good chance of being Really
Important, but it is going to take a long for it to get accepted as a viable
alternative to other payment solutions.
