  
As Mike said, help on "initial headers-only download" would be much
appreciated.  
  
Work-in-progress is here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/blockheaders  
  
... and my notes on issues that have to be worked out are here:

As for scalability in general: it looks to me like CPU time to validate
transactions will be the bottleneck before bandwidth or disk space, so I don't
see a strong reason to switching to a 'ledger' or 'balance sheet' method.
Effective optimization/scalability is all about identifying and eliminating
bottlenecks.
