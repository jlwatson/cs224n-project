Since you aren't a cryptographer, why not just implement transactions with
multiple signatures?  

Because sending to a multiple-signature-required address requires a new
standard transaction type, a new type of bitcoin address, and a protocol for
Device 1 <-> Device 2 communication. More code means more possibility of bugs,
so I was hoping there is a simpler solution.  
  
And as I said in the original post, I wanted to start discussion:

and then point me to a FIPS standard that has it all figured out already...

If the answer is "multiple signatures" then so be it.
