So where will I find this scientific analysis?

I'll certainly retract my accusation that you're trolling if you actually did do some careful peer-reviewed analysis. But all I found after a quick surf of the ViaCoin web site was a lot of marketing hype and approximately zero scientific analysis.

So I'll say it again: put up or shut up.
