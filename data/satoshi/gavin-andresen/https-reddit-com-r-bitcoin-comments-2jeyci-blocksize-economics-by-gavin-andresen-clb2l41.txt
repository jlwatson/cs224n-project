How much does it cost the network to store an unspent transaction output forever?

(there's a bitcointalk forum thread that does a back-of-the-envelope estimate, but I'm too lazy to go search for it right now).

Or better: what is the cost of storing a UTXO versus the cost of broadcasting/validating/storing a spend?

Some costs are so small they are not worth charging for.
