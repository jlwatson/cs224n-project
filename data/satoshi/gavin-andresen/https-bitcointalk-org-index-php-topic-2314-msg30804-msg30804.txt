Maybe a composite ID would solve the problem, anyway I think that if something
is called ID it should be guaranteed to be unique (or collision likelihood
should be limited to the probability of a hash collision)  

  
Just use transactionID+account.  
  
You've already got the problem that if a customer sends coins from account A
to an address that belongs to account B, that is a single, unique transaction
that affects two accounts.  
  
listtransactions will Do the Right Thing (generate two entries, different
accounts, same transaction id). And gettransaction won't lie to you (it
doesn't say anything about what accounts were involved, on purpose, for
exactly this reason).
