  
Just use transactionID+account.  
  
You've already got the problem that if a customer sends coins from account A
to an address that belongs to account B, that is a single, unique transaction
that affects two accounts.  
  
listtransactions will Do the Right Thing (generate two entries, different
accounts, same transaction id). And gettransaction won't lie to you (it
doesn't say anything about what accounts were involved, on purpose, for
exactly this reason).
