So... please don't take this the wrong way, but what's your prior experience
creating and shipping high-quality software?  
  
I ask because re-implementing Bitcoin as a first "software-people-other-than-
myself-are-going-to-use" project is a really bad idea, I don't see any list of
previous work at the RocketHub page, and the 9,000 lines of code you've
already written doesn't look like the work of somebody who has professional
software development experience (e.g. no makefile/build system ...).  
  
Maybe you're a prodigy and will get it right the first time, but you're
already at 'cbitcoin 2.0' because you weren't happy with how 'cbitcoin 1.0'
was turning out. See the solidcoin/microcash saga for an example of how over-
promising "1.0/2.0/3.0" releases destroys confidence.  
  
And maybe you CAN point to some other successful software you wrote and
shipped when you were 17, in which case I'll shut up and leave you alone.
