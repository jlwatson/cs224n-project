  
When I say "soft-fork" I mean "a majority of miners upgrade and force all the
rest of the miners to go along (but merchants and other fully-validating, non-
mining nodes do not have to upgrade)."  
  
Note that individual miners (or sub-majority cartels) can unilaterally create
smaller blocks containing just higher-fee transactions, if they think it is in
their long-term interest to put upward pressure on transaction fees.  
  
  
Would 40% initial size and growth make you support the proposal?  
  
  
Anybody know economists who specialize in this sort of problem? Judging by
what I know about economics and economists, I suspect if we ask eleven of them
we'll get seven different opinions for the best thing to do. Five of which
will miss the point of Bitcoin entirely. ("...elect a Board of Blocksize
Governors that decides on an Optimal Size based on market supply and demand
conditions as measured by an independent Bureau of Blocksize Research....")
