This thread talks in detail about Bitcoin's use of hashing of ECDSA public
keys to generate bitcoin addresses.  
  
Executive summary:  
bitcoinaddress = RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(publickey))  
  
So you'd need to break both RIPEMD-160 and SHA-256 hashing algorithms. And the
RIPEMD break would have to be quite extreme-- more than just "add some random
data to force a hash collision" (which is how MD5 is broken), because it is
hashing a SHA-256 hash, so you're not able to add some random data to be
hashed.
