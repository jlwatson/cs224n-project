identity? I may be wrong, but without the signature hashes I think you can get
two different transactions (two transactions that are exactly the same as far
as scriptPubKeys, but spend different outputs) that hash to the same value,
which would cause all sorts of problems, including replay attacks re-using old
signatures.  
  
  
Interesting... too radical a change for right now, in my opinion. (I think
Pieter's proposal is too radical a change for right now, too... I'm on the
fence about whether OP_EVAL is too radical a change, but I think the
advantages outweigh the risks).  
  
  
Pieter's proposal is <signature+2bits>
