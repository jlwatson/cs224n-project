If such comprehensive changes are being considered then I suggest that the
default option should be that the signatures for a transaction should not
influence the transaction hash.  

  
... but isn't it the signatures that give each transaction its unique
identity? I may be wrong, but without the signature hashes I think you can get
two different transactions (two transactions that are exactly the same as far
as scriptPubKeys, but spend different outputs) that hash to the same value,
which would cause all sorts of problems, including replay attacks re-using old
signatures.

Another improvement would be the introduction of the Bernstein signature
scheme with a similar security parameter to the existing ECDSA but a much
faster verification. Transactions using the cheaper signatures could get a
discount on the fees or be allowed more sigOps.  

  
Interesting... too radical a change for right now, in my opinion. (I think
Pieter's proposal is too radical a change for right now, too... I'm on the
fence about whether OP_EVAL is too radical a change, but I think the
advantages outweigh the risks).

With regards to key recovery, a 2 bit hint can be used to accellerate the
process. Alternatively, a single hint value could be assumed and it would be
the responsibility of the signer to redo the signing operation until the
assumed hint value is correct.  

  
Pieter's proposal is <signature+2bits>
