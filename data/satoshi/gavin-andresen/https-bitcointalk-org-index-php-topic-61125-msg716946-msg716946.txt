I'm curious to know how thoroughly these proposals have been tested. That
might go a long way toward swaying opinion. I would imagine having a public
alt-coin for the sole purpose of implementing one proposal or the other and
seeing how easy it is to break could be a great proving ground.  

Testing is actually one of the reasons I don't like BIP 17; it is harder to
test, because it is much easier to steal BIP-17 transactions if the network
hasn't yet upgraded (Luke has had to test BIP 17 on the main network instead
of testnet because I wrote a BIP-17-stealing robot and ran it on testnet).  
  
I've spent the last couple of days running "transaction fuzzing" tests against
both the new BIP 16 code and old clients; so far it has turned up no problems.
"Fuzzing" means throwing lots and lots of random inputs at a program and
making sure it deals with them properly; it is another good way of finding the
"what do you know, we didn't think of that..." bugs.  
  
The fuzzing tool is here:

Also RE: ghastly exploits:  
  
Satoshi himself made changes to the way the scripting language works after a
series of 'ghastly exploits' were discovered back in 2010 after the first
slashdotting. I'm so stubbornly against BIP 17 because it basically reverts
one of the changes he made (separating execution of scriptSig and
scriptPubKey-- take that discussion to another thread in Dev&Tech if you want
to argue more about it, please).
