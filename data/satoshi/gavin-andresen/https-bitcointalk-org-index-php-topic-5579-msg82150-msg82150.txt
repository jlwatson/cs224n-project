Or somebody have access to hundreds google accounts...  

  
Hundreds of google accounts AND hundreds of IP addresses (the Faucet does
still check IP address). And the patience to solve hundreds of CAPTCHAs...  
  
I'm pretty sure almost all of the bitcoins going out of the Faucet are new
people trying out Bitcoin. We're getting between 500 and 1,000 downloads of
bitcoin binaries from the SourceForge site per day (stats here).  
  
PS: Thanks again to everybody who donates to keep the Faucet running!
