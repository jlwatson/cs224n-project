Since it seems a lot of pools have been hacked (and balances emptied)
recently, I just thought I'd let everyone know that Eligius _should be_ immune
to this attack. Since we generally payout in generation, I can safely encrypt
the pool wallet, and never unlock it on the actual pool server (ie, only
create manual payout transactions on an offline system).  

  
But what if somebody hacked into your server and modified the code that
decides which addresses get paid out?  
  
If they were smart, they'd shave just a little bit from everybody's payout and
insert a payout to themselves... I imagine it could take quite a while before
anybody noticed.
