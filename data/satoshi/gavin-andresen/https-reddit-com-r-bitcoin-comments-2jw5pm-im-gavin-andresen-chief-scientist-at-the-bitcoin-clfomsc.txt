I worry about that a little bit. I think the key is to make sure we keep 'permissionless innovation.'

I think lots of people confuse natural concentrations of power or wealth that come from either being smarter or more savvy or luckier or starting with more power or wealth or reputation with systems that prevent newcomers from competing with entrenched interests.
