First I'm converting the float to a string representation, then using that to
make a object of BigDecimal(with 8 places for correct representation), and
then multiplying by 100,000,000.  
  
Everything else is done internally with integers.  

  
That sounds overly complicated. Does your ruby/json implementation have
double-precision (64-bit) floats? If it does, just multiply by 1.0e8 and
rounding to the nearest integer.  
  
Quick way to tell if your ruby implementation does 64-bit floats: see what you
get converting 21000000.00000001*1e8 to an integer.
