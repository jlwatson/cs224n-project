This pull is prompted by changes I'm making to ClearCoin, and should apply to
any service where customers will owe the service bitcoins. It removes the
account balance checks from the RPC move command.  
  
I'll use it to create accounts associated with users that keep track of how
many bitcoins they owe; for example, if I owed 1 bitcoin ClearCoin will tell
bitcoin:  
move 'gavinandresen' 'total_owed' 1.00  
  
Assuming I'm not carrying a balance, that makes the gavinandresen account
balance -1.00 BTC. When I pay to one of the addresses associated with the
'gavinandresen' account, the account balance will be automatically credited.  
  
If I were a professional accountant I probably would have written 'move' this
way to begin with...
