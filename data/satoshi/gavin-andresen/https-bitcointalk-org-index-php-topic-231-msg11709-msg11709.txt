I agree with the sentiment that a small reference client would be hugely
helpful. I would like one that ran on Google App Engine, for instance, and as
you say, a reference javascript version would be totally fabulous.  

Neither of those are feasible-- both App Engine and Javascript don't allow
arbitrary socket connections, and a full bitcoin client needs to maintain a
persistent connection to at least one other bitcoin client to get transaction
messages.  
  
"Background servers capable of running for longer than 30s" is a feature on
Google's roadmap, so maybe a 100% App Engine bitcoin client will be possible
in the future.
