Neither of those are feasible-- both App Engine and Javascript don't allow
arbitrary socket connections, and a full bitcoin client needs to maintain a
persistent connection to at least one other bitcoin client to get transaction
messages.  
  
"Background servers capable of running for longer than 30s" is a feature on
Google's roadmap, so maybe a 100% App Engine bitcoin client will be possible
in the future.
