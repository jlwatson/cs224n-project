Is the main thrust and incredulity in your argument because you think there
CANNOT be a better solution than burning 100,000 CPU at 100% 24/7 and sending
100,000+ redundant messages per transaction?  

No, not at all. Like I said when I jumped into this thread, I think using a
DHT network to somehow distribute the work is a very interesting idea, it just
seems to me any solution that partitions the network will be more vulnerable
to attacks that insert malicious nodes. I think it would be fantastic to come
up with less resource-intensive solution that actually works.  
  
How does Freenet generate node IDs? The only info I see in the latest Freenet
paper is:

When joining, nodes choose an identity at random, and then connect to those
peers with whom they have a pre-established trusted relationship.

.... and:

Quote

The perhaps largest advantage that the trusted-connection model offers over
traditional anonymity networks is protection against the Sybil attack [13],
where a single attacker infiltrates the network by pretending to have many
identities. Since the network depends on out of band trust relationships, an
attacker gains strength only through the number of people he can fool into
trusting him, and gains nothing by presenting multiple identities online.

...which doesn't sound like it would work very well for Bitcoin.
