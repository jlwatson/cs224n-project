Don't panic.  
  
roconnor has been experimenting with spending "duplicate coinbase
transactions" on the testnet. Block explorer is confused, and isn't seeing the
50 bitcoins generated to that address in testnet block 45,442 (because the
generation transaction has the same ID as the generation transaction in block
45,333).  
  
Expect code changes before the 0.6 release is final to discourage and
eventually prohibit accepting blocks with duplicate coinbase transactions;
although we can't see a way to exploit this weirdness to cheat anybody (it is
easy to cheat yourself out of bitcoins using duplicate coinbase transactions
that cannot be spent), it's definitely not a good thing.
