No, the send-from address is not available, for a couple of reasons:  
  
1) When people using a shared wallet service like MyBitcoin or MtGox send
payments the "from address" could belong to any of the other users of the
service (or could be a "change" address that doesn't belong to anybody). It is
a bad idea to think that "address == person".  
  
2) If more complicated transaction types are ever "turned on" in bitcoin,
there might be more than one "from address". Satoshi designed-in support for
complicated transactions like "this payment can only be spent if 2 of these 3
keys sign the transaction". In that case, there would be two "from addresses".  
  
If you need this to refund coins, you'll need to ask the customer for a refund
address.
