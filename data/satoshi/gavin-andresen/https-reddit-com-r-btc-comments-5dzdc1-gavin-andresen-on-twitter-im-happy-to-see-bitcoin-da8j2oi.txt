No, I don't remember that.

I do remember saying that doing nothing would retard Bitcoin adoption for a year or three while clever engineers figure out some workaround (like 'extension blocks' or some other, more complicated wedge-it-into-a-soft-fork solution).

And that there was a real risk of Bitcoin becoming the MySpace of cryptocurrency (but "a real risk" is NOT "bitcoin is DOOMED").

If Bitcoin DOES become the MySpace of cryptocurrencies, I'll blame Back and Maxwell and Todd and Dashjr. But, again, I don't think that is the most likely outcome, it is just a significant risk.
