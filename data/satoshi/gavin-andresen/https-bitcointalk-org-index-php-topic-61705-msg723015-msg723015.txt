For context: makomk is the creator of CoiledCoin, a bitcoin alternative:

And RE: creating bots: I created a BIP-17-stealing bot because it was really
easy (took about 10 minutes of hacking). A BIP-16-stealing bot would be a lot
harder (because it would have to 'lie in wait' until the sender was redeeming
the coins, and then race to relay/mine a 'stealing' version of the transaction
before the rest of the network mined the original).
