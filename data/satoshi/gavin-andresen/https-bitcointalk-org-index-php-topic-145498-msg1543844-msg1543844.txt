A hard fork won't happen unless the vast super-majority of miners support it.

Example: increasing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE (a 'hard' blockchain split change)  
  
Increasing the maximum block size beyond the current 1MB per block (perhaps
changing it to a floating limit based on a multiple of the median size of the
last few hundred blocks) is a likely future change to accomodate more
transactions per block. A new maximum block size rule might be rolled out by:  
  
New software creates blocks with a new block.version  
Allow greater-than-MAX_BLOCK_SIZE blocks if their version is the new
block.version or greater and 100% of the last 1000 blocks are new blocks. (51%
of the last 100 blocks if on testnet)  
100% of the last 1000 blocks is a straw-man; the actual criteria would
probably be different (maybe something like block.timestamp is after
1-Jan-2015 and 99% of the last 2000 blocks are new-version), since this change
means the first valid greater-than-MAX_BLOCK_SIZE-block immediately kicks
anybody running old software off the main block chain.
