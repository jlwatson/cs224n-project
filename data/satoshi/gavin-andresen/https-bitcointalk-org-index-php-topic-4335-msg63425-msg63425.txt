  
Well, imagine an attacker did manage to surround your node.  
What can they do?  
  
a) Dropping outgoing transactions-- a send-coins denial-of-service.  
b) Dropping incoming transactions-- a 0-confirmation-receive-coins denial-of-
service  
  
Can these be exploited somehow to the attacker's advantage? Maybe if attacker
and attackee were competing on a bidding site or the site being attacked was a
bidding site and the attacker wanted to squash competing bids. Rounding up
thousands of IPs to try to get a better deal on biddingpond hardly seems worth
it. And an old-fashioned DDoS attack can probably take out any one particular
node anyway, with or without bitcoin involved.  
  
c) Dropping new block announcements (that would be a 1+-confirmation-receive-
coins DoS)  
d) ... and maybe feeding the attacked node attacker-generated blocks  
  
(d) is more serious, because the attacker could generate bogus N-confirmation
transactions. But it should be detectable; assuming the attacker doesn't have
as much hashing power as the rest of the network, blocks will be generated
much more slowly (either much more slowly after the last compiled-in block
checkpoint if you're downloading the block chain, or much more slowly since
the last time your node connected to the network).
