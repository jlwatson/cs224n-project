More discussions in IRC today prompted further tweaks to this API:  
  
"get any transaction, even transactions that aren't in your wallet"
functionality will be moved from gettransaction to a new 'getrawtransaction'
API call, for two reasons:  
1\. It doesn't 'feel' right to mix the high-level info with the nitty-gritty
low-level detail.  
2\. We think there's a potential for security vulnerabilities if there are
existing services that assume that 'gettransaction txid' returns an error for
any transaction not in the wallet (as it does in all previous releases).  
  
So the new plan is to put the new functionality in a new RPC call:  
  
getrawtransaction <txid> [verbose=0] : If verbose=0, returns a JSON string
that is the hex-encoded, serialized transaction. That is the "machine
readable, as concise as possible" use case. If verbose=1, returns a JSON
object with all the nitty-gritty details, to cover all the other use cases.  
  
Also, Jeff already has a pull request for JSON-2.0 "batch" functionality, so
if you need information about all transactions in a block or all of a
transaction's parent transactions you can get it with one RPC round-trip.
