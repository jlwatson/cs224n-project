In either case, you keep the imported private key in the wallet, in case more
BTC is sent to it.  

  
So what happens when two users import the same private key into their wallets?  
(or you accidently or on-purpose import the same private key into two of your
wallets?)  
  
You can say "Don't Do That", but if they CAN do that, then they WILL.
