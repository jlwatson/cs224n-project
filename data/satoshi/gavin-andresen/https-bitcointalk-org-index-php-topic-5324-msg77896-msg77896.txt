Cloning your wallet to do anything besides backing it up is a bad idea.  
  
It might work perfectly for a while... but you are very likely to get weird
behavior from bitcoin sooner or later, because doing that is not tested or
supported.  
  
Where 'weird behavior' is one clone of the wallet shows one balance, the other
clone shows another, and you might end up with bitcoins that you can spend
from one wallet but not the other (or, worst case, end up with bitcoins that
neither wallet is able to spend).  
  
If you REALLY REALLY REALLY want to do this... then get the latest code from
git, pull sipa's 'Spent per txout' patch, and then spend a bunch of time
testing to find out what happens when your cloned wallets eventually start
using different keys from the keypool.
