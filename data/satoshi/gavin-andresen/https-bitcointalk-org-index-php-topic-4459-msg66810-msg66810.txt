Actually, falling asleep last night I realized what I proposed would be yet
another variation on an 'anybody can claim' transaction (anybody can just
choose an r1 that make r1 XOR hash_xor_r1 evaluate to a hash that they own).  
  
I think this would work:  

Code:

OP_OVER OP_ADD OP_HASH160 <hash160(r1+public_key)> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG  

... supply <scriptsig> <public_key> <r1> to claim.  
  
I'm not suggesting anything like this get implemented any time soon, I started
this thread just to explore what is possible.
