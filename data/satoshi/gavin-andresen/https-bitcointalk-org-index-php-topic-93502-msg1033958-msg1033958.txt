What do you mean "send from A" ? Are A and B accounts or bitcoin addresses?  
  
The reference client does not send coins "from" an address; when you send
coins they are chosen from any of the available inputs in your wallet.  
  
If you receive 50 BTC to an address associated with an empty account "A", then
move those 50 bitcoins to account "B", then make the RPC call:  
sendfrom "A" <to_address> 50  
  
... you will get an error "Account has insuficient funds"  
  
  
I have no idea what 2112 is talking about RE: accountants having trouble
figuring out how the accounts feature operates. It is very much like separate
accounts at a bank, where dollars and coins flow in, are credited to accounts,
and then flow back out (debiting accounts). If I take a bag of cash to the
bank and have it deposited into my account, I don't expect to get exactly the
same bills and coins out the next time I make a withdrawal, and I shouldn't be
surprised if the bank uses those coins and bills for withdrawals from other
accounts.
