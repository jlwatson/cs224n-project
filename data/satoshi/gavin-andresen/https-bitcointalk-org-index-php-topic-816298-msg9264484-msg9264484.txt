  
Please stop trolling. I think what I think and do what I do because I want the
Bitcoin Project to be even more wildly successful.  
  
If I was motivated by greed I would have a much higher salary. And lots of
stock options.  
  
The majority of Bitcoin users here want transaction fees less than a penny; I
want them to be as low as practical. The only way to get there is to increase
the block size.
