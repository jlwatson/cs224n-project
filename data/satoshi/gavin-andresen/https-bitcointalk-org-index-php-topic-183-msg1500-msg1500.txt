Showing the number of Bitcoins available is on my TODO list. I just checked
and the balance is up to 1,135 (thanks to whoever donated!).  
  
And right now it is 5 bitcoins per IP address (not bitcoin address). Not per-
day-- just 5. I want to start out conservatively, I will loosen it to 5 per
(day?/week?/month?) if people start having lots of trouble because they get a
dynamic IP address from their ISP that already got some.  
  
RE: captchas: yeah, I was gonna start out with a captcha, but I wanted it to
be as simple and non-threatening as possible. I don't _think_ anybody who has
access to hundreds or thousands of working public IP addresses would go to the
effort of writing a bitcoin-harvesting robot, though I suppose somebody with a
botnet might take a crack at it. To make that tougher I could make it 5
bitcoins per IP AND 5 bitcoins per bitcoin address (so they couldn't have all
the bots in the botnet using the same BC address).
