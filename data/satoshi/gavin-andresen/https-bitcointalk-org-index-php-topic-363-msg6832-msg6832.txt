That IS part of the new -port / -rpcport code (I use
boost::interprocess::file_lock to make sure bitcoins running on different
ports don't try to use the same wallet/blkindex/etc files).  
  
I'll create an svnTEST branch that omits those changes, and will always be
just a TEST-network version of the latest svn trunk.
