For my first Bitcoin coding project, I decided to do something that sounds
really dumb: I created a web site that gives away Bitcoins. It is at:
https://freebitcoins.appspot.com/  
  
Five ฿ per customer, first come first served, I've stocked it with ฿1,100 to
start. I'll add more once I'm sure it is working properly.  
  
Why? Because I want the Bitcoin project to succeed, and I think it is more
likely to be a success if people can get a handful of coins to try it out. It
can be frustrating to wait until your node generates some coins (and that will
get more frustrating in the future), and buying Bitcoins is still a little bit
clunky.  
  
Please try it out and get some free coins, even if you already have more
Bitcoins than you know what to do with. You can get some and then donate them
right back; the address is: ~~15VjRaDX9zpbA8LVnbrCAFzrVzN7ixHNsC~~
