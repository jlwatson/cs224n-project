Backup every 30 sendtoaddress or generatenewaddress and you'll be fine-- you
should always have at least 3 backup copies of all your keys.  
  
If you're running a very busy service so backing up every 30 is too often,
then run with -keypool=1000 and backup at least every 300 sends/generates.  
  
I worry about bitcoin accumulating too many features and not doing any of them
very well. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to add an option so it automatically
creates timestamped wallet backups... but should it erase old backups? (if it
doesn't, I KNOW people will forget to erase them and will be upset when their
disk fills up with wallet backups and they're left to figure out how to clean
up the resulting mess). Should it encrypt them? What should it do if an
automatic time-stamped wallet backup fails? When encrypted wallets are
implemented, what should happen to old backups if the wallet encryption key is
changed?
