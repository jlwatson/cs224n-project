Does it make sense to send the coins a little at a time, in case the Faucet
gets scammed again?  

Yes, I'll send... oh, I dunno, $200 or so worth of bitcoins at a time to the
Faucet.  
  
RE: not holding the EFF in high esteem: I still strongly support the EFF.
They're good people working to make the world a better place, and I trust them
to know better than I do whether or not accepting bitcoin donations is good
for both them and the bitcoin project.
