Luke is guessing it is SatoshiDice, it might just be a run of bad luck.  
  
Or it might be a side effect of Eligius accepting non-standard transactions.  
  
Does Eligius include transactions that have not been transmitted/relayed to
the rest of the network? If so, it might be a side effect of that (and if that
isn't a side effect now, it might be in the future if Eligius blocks take
longer to verify as other nodes need to fetch transaction inputs from disk,
instead of already having them in cache memory like transactions that ARE
transmitted/relayed).
