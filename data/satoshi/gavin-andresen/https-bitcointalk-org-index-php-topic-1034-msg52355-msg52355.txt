 ~~Oops, sorry-- I forgot to change the admin password. The correct pw for
that instance is:  
penguinsrule~~  
  
I change the password to match the MinGW VM and updated the AMI:  
ami-d621d2bf 982440761210/BitcoinVC10  
Admin password: bitcoin development  
  
You should change the password as soon as you login or make sure you use a
security group that only allows your IP address to access the virtual machine.
