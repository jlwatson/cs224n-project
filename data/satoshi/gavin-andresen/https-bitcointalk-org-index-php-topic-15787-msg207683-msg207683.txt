Yep. Every transaction you make potentially leaks a little information about
other transactions to/from your bitcoin wallet.  
  
That's why I always say "bitcoin anonymity is complicated" and "bitcoin
transactions are more private than credit card or bank transactions, but less
private than cash transactions" or "staying completely anonymous while using
bitcoins is hard."  
  
And that's why you won't find (or, at least, shouldn't find) any claims that
bitcoin is anonymous on the bitcoin.org home page or in the bitcoin source
code.  
  
What can you do? Use separate wallets. Make your donation address an
instawallet or mybitcoin address that you don't use for anything else.
