  
They tend to get put back together when you send larger payments.  
  
The algorithm that the current bitcoin client uses isn't the best possible
algorithm for deciding when to combine or split coins; ideally, it would have
some notion of how big your average transaction would be, and when sending
coins it might split change or combine extra coins to make change that is
about that big (so the next time you make a transaction there are old,
previous, high-priority transactions it can use).  
  
If you ask nicely, I bet tcatm or somebody else will create a little web
service that could tell you how long you have to wait for a 0.10 (or whatever)
coin to mature before you can send it without a fee.
