This has got me thinking. When transactions occur the coins get "broken up" if
needed to make the payment with some change sent back to you. Wouldn't that
mean that slowly the coins will get broken up smaller and smaller with time
causing the kb for the transaction to go up, making the data required for
transactions to slowly go up?  

  
They tend to get put back together when you send larger payments.  
  
The algorithm that the current bitcoin client uses isn't the best possible
algorithm for deciding when to combine or split coins; ideally, it would have
some notion of how big your average transaction would be, and when sending
coins it might split change or combine extra coins to make change that is
about that big (so the next time you make a transaction there are old,
previous, high-priority transactions it can use).  
  
If you ask nicely, I bet tcatm or somebody else will create a little web
service that could tell you how long you have to wait for a 0.10 (or whatever)
coin to mature before you can send it without a fee.
