Neat idea!  
  
I don't get the economics of it, though-- how do I convince the network to
run/check the calculations I want the MerkleWeb to run rather than somebody
else's? And does anything prevent me from asking the MerkleWeb to do some
useless busy-work that is just designed to chew up computing resources? Who
decides what gets run on the Turing machine, when?
