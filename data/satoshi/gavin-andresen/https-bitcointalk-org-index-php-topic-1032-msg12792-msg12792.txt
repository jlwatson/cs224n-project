encrypt by default, with payee's public key  

... but a payer typically has only the bitcoin address, and not the payee's
full public key. There'd have to be some way to get the full public key for a
bitcoin address.  
  
I like the idea of being able to send encrypted messages to "whoever has
bitcoin address BLAH", but I'm not sure that functionality should be
piggybacked on the "send BLAH X.YZ bitcoins".  
  
If they were implemented under the covers as separate functions, then a "Send
a message along with payment" could easily be implemented as:  
1\. Send BLAH X.YZ bitcoins, and note the transaction ID.  
2\. Send BLAH an encrypted message: "txid:{transaction_id}:Please send the
sixteen My Little Pony DVDs to..."
