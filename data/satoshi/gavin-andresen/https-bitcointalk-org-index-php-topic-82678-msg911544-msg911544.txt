No. Bitcoin connections are TCP, so you can't forge the IP address.  
  
I've also implemented denial-of-service checks that automatically ban
misbehaving peers to make network disruption attacks more difficult. Trying to
anticipate future DoS attacks is hidden engineering work that you will never
notice if we get it right.
