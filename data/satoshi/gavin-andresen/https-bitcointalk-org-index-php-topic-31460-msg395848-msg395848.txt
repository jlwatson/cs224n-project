Here's a scheme that would work:  
  
1\. Exchange creates a special bitcoin keypair for each exchange rate it wants
to publish.  
E.g. maybe there is a 1mtgxbtcusd9873919fp876... address for mtgox btc/usd  
  
2\. Exchange funds that address with a bunch of bitcoins.  
  
3\. Every 10 minutes the exchange performs a send-to-self transaction FROM
that address TO that address with the number of bitcoins that correspond to
the current exchange rate.  
  
Voila, exchange rate is broadcast to anybody who cares to listen. You know it
is the exchange, because the exchange is the only entity that can spend
bitcoins from the special exchange address.  
  
You have to trust the exchange not to broadcast a bogus price...
