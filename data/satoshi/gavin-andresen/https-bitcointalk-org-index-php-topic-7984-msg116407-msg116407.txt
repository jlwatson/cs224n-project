I've been working on making the ClearCoin escrow service's fee structure
simpler; here's the new structure, which will "go live" in the next day or
two:  
  
ClearCoin costs 0.5% (one half of one percent) of released coins. For example,
if you are paying for something worth 100 bitcoins the cost will be 0.5 BTC.  
  
Fees are paid only on released coins; no fees are charged on coins donated to
charity or refunded to you.  
  
Coins in escrow will never be taken or held if you have unpaid fees; if you do
not pay your ClearCoin fees within 30 days we may prevent you from creating
new escrow transactions but will never prevent you from releasing coins from
existing escrow accounts. However, given how quickly the value of bitcoins has
been increasing recently, it is better for you to pay your ClearCoin fees
quickly.  
  
Any month you accumulate more than a trivial amount of fees ClearCoin will
email you an invoice with a detailed list and a bitcoin address to which you
can send payment. You can also pay at any time by sending bitcoins to an
address on the ClearCoin website.  
  
  
All of these changes were prompted because I think it was confusing to pay
fees directly from the bitcoins being used for the transactions-- if you were
paying for something that cost 159.95 BTC, calculating how much to send to pay
for the cost AND ClearCoin fees was complicated. This should also be much
easier for anybody creating a lot of ClearCoin transactions via the new
ClearCoin API.  
  
As always, feedback, complaints, and suggestions are welcome.
