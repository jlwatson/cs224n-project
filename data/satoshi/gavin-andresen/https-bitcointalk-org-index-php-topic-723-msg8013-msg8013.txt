So for any new transaction, to verify it, you send it to the five closest
nodes to each in-point on the transaction. They record the transaction and
immediately tell you if they've seen a double spend. If any have, it's a bogus
transaction, which gets broadcast to the other close nodes.  

  
What happens when they disagree about which transaction happened first?
Majority rule? Who decides what the majority is, and can it change if 4 of the
five nodes leave the network and are replaced by another 5 nodes?  
  
And if I know that I'm going to create a large transaction, can I do some work
precomputing node IDs such that the transaction (which I haven't yet sent out)
will hash to nodes that I control? If I control all the nodes storing the
transaction, then I can just answer "yes, absolutely, that transaction is
valid and hasn't been double-spent..."  
  
The brilliant insight behind bitcoin is the distributed timestamping
mechanism; everybody agrees on an order of transactions. I don't see how your
scheme solves that problem.
