There are rumors that the Bitcoin network will split in two, one side, people
using 0.5.1, 0.4.0.... On the other side, people using 0.6.0...

I've been working hard to make sure there will be no blockchain split, and
I've convinced myself I've thought through all the "old/new client sending
transactions to an old/new miner" cases.  
  
The only case where an old miner could be split off the network is if they are
mining non-standard transactions (which means they've modified their mining
code) and do not upgrade. If you are in that situation, then you should either
stop adding transactions containing OP_NOP1 into your miner's memory pool or
upgrade to interpret OP_NOP1 as OP_EVAL.  
  
But I've said it before and I'll say it again: don't trust me. I make
mistakes. Two serious bugs in my OP_EVAL/multisignature code have been found
(and fixed) in the last week. Version 0.6 **will** have at least a month of
release candidate testing.  
  
I still firmly believe the benefits of the new 0.6 features far outweigh the
risks. Please help minimize the risks; review code if you can, run release
candidate on the testnet and try to break them, read the BIPS and try to think
of ways bad people might use them to do bad things. Review the contingency
plans and think about how they could be improved or if you could help when
(when, not if) vulnerabilities are found.
