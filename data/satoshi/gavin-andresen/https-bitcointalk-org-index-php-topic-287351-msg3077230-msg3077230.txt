I just downloaded 2 different SHASUMS.asc within an hour from from sourceforge
... what's going on?  

  
My build environment changed and the first -linux.tar.gz contained ._foo files
(see http://superuser.com/questions/61185/why-do-i-get-files-like-foo-in-my-
tarball-on-os-x ).  
  
So I untarred and re-tarred with the magic "don't be clever, please, OSX"
environment variable set and uploaded a new .tar.gz and SHASUMS.
