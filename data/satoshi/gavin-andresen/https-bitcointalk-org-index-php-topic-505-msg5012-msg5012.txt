I think this won't work because there is not a one-to-one relationship between
"unspent transactions" and public keys.  
  
Example: I start with 0 BTC. Two people each send me 50, to the same receiving
address "GavinPubKey".  
  
Balance Sheet: GavinPubKey: 100  
I spend the first one:  
Balance Sheet: GavinPubKey: 50  
  
If I'm dishonest, what stops me from waiting a few months and then spending
that first 50 again instead of spending that second 50? Double-spending that
first 50 will look like a perfectly valid transaction to any nodes using the
balance sheet method who weren't around to see the first time I spent it.
