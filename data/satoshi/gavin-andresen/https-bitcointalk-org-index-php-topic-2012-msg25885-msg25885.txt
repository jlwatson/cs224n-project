I'm reminded of the Y2K hype back in 2000; that was a predictable event that
turned out to be a non-event.  

  
When I see somebody claim that Y2K was a non-event, I have to either assume
this is a strawman argument or somebody who is completely clueless about what
actually happened.  
  
....... But saying that it is a non-issue because other similar kinds of
problems have been non-issues is ignoring why they were non-issues in the
first place. I don't get it.  

  
Y2K was a non-event exactly because it was predictable and so lots of people
did lots of work to make sure nothing terribly bad happened.  
  
My point is only that the block #210,000 switchover will, I think, be exactly
the same. An entirely predictable event that people will plan and prepare for.
It will be a significant event only for the very small minority of people who
have to do the planning and preparing.  
  
RE: complacency: I think we're a lot better at getting complacent about random
events (like earthquakes and hurricanes) than "this is absolutely 100% certain
to happen on or around this date" events.
