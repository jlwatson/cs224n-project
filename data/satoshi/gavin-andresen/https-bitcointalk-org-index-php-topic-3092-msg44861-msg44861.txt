I'm running version 0.3.19 and I cannot find neither `getblock` nor
`monitorblock`. Are these new methods coming for 0.3.20? Well, if `getblock`
does what I think it does (ie, return all information available about a given
block number, including block hash and transactions) then it would of course
be an alternative way to implement the "shoot-myself-in-the-foot" client.
Everybody can be happy, yay!  

  
They're not in 0.3.20; maybe 0.3.21.

... is the not-yet-ready-for-prime-time branch they're on.
