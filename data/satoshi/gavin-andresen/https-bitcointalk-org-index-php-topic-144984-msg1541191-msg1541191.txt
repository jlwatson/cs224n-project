So the current one megabyte hard limit is already double the limit Satoshi
originally put in place?  

No, the hard limit has been 1 megabyte forever. But 500K was the largest block
Satoshi's code could possibly build (I believe that that wasn't even possible
in practice, because you'd have to spend all 21 million bitcoins in fees to
fill it to 500K).
