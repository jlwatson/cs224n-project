Best thing I've bought: Boston Red Sox tickets (from a friend who has season
tickets).  
Second best: my alpaca socks.  
And I've bought three or four lunches with bitcoins so far (also from
friends-- they pay, then I repay them in BTC).  
  
I really wish I had a use for Golden Mean Calipers, they look nifty.
