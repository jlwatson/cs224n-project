Yes, diversity is good. If you do decide to go for it, do lots of testing on
either the test network or with a testnet-in-a-box setup before even THINKING
about handling real bitcoins. If you screw up and lose other people's money it
will take a long time to earn back their trust.  
  
Oh, and speaking of trust... unless you have a recognized Brand Name, I don't
think you'll have any success with a closed-source client.
