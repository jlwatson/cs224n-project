My rule of thumb is "never inline methods more than 1 line long."  
  
Unless you're doing something super performance-critical, in which case my
rule of thumb is "don't change anything until after you've written a realistic
benchmark."  
  
But I'm an old-fashioned C++ coder, kids these days seem to want to put all
the code in .hpp files.
