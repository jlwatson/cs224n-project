No, I think wealth and economic well-being comes from increasing productivity.

I do think that taking money from one set of people and giving it to another set of people is a zero-sum game, unless doing that increases productivity.

It might be possible to make a very good argument that increasing the minimum wage makes workers more productive, and that increased productivity more than offsets productivity losses (because there will be less investment in capital or re-investment or spending of profits).

But I don't see proponents of the minimum wage making that argument, which makes me think they have another model in their heads of how the minimum wage makes the world a better place, which is why I ask.
