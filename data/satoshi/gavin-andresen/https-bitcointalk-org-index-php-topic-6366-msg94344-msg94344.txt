If I were Satoshi... I would have built a modest amount of inflation in to
bitcoin. "Modest inflation is what most people are comfortable and familiar
with," I would have reasoned to myself, "so that's the right thing to do."  
  
However... I'm not so sure that would have worked. It is _very_ nice to be
able to say "bitcoins are valuable because they are rare, and they are rare
because they are designed that way-- there will never be more than 21-million
of them." That is easy to understand, and gives bitcoins a clear advantage
over existing currencies.
