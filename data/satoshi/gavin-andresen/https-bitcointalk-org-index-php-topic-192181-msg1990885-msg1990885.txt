So I'm guessing a 3rd option happens, it sends my BitcoinAddress, plus some
other derived number that lets the network know that my client has my private
key, but it doesn't actually send my private key. Is that right?  

  
Yes.  
  
If you want to get geeky about it, it sends an ECDSA signature derived from
the private key and the transaction data, and the full public key that
corresponds to your bitcoin address (the address is a shorter version of it).
