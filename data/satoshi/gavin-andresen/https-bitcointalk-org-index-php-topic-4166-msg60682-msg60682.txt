If you try and mine with a cpu it should point and laugh or say "youre doing
it wrong".  

  
WAAAAAY back in May of last year I did a little CPU mining. Then stopped when
I realized I was spending more on electricity than the bitcoins I generated
were worth. Bitcoins were selling for under a penny a piece, and I figured it
cost a couple cents in electricity to mine them.  
  
So if you think there's a chance bitcoin prices will be 10 or 100 times higher
in the next year or three, maybe CPU mining now isn't crazy.  
  
Just saying.
