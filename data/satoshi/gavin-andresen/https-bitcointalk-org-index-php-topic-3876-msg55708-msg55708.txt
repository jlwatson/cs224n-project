  
Uh-huh... storing a lot of bitcoins on a usually-network-connected device
would make me very nervous. I think we're going to see a LOT of smartphone
exploits over the next 5 years (maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised and it will
turn out the smartphone OS folks have done a great job making them secure).  
  
But security is not a boolean, and we clearly need to do what we can to help
people keep their bitcoin wallets secure.
