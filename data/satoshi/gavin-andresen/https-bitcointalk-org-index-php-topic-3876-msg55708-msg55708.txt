...The most obvious is root exploits on the phones themselves, if there's a
local root exploit then a bad app you install can still steal your wallet
until the OS is patched. But at least it's not insecure-by-design like
Mac/Linux/Windows are, and local root exploits aren't that common on these
devices.  

  
Uh-huh... storing a lot of bitcoins on a usually-network-connected device
would make me very nervous. I think we're going to see a LOT of smartphone
exploits over the next 5 years (maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised and it will
turn out the smartphone OS folks have done a great job making them secure).  
  
But security is not a boolean, and we clearly need to do what we can to help
people keep their bitcoin wallets secure.
