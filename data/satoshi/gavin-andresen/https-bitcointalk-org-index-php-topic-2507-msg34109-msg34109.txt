i think gavin's bitcointools can already extract keys from wallet?  

  
It dumps out keys in abbreviated hex (I worry about naive users accidently
publishing screen snapshots showing their full private keys).  
  
Teaching bitcointools to dump out keys in OpenSSL ascii-armored format is a
great idea. It is just not high on my personal priority list right now.
