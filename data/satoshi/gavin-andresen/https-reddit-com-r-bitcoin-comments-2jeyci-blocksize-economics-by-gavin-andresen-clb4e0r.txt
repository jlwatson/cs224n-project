I'll quote myself from this thread on bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=813324.msg9146609#msg9146609

RE: assurance contracts not working:

okey dokey. Please don't continue to muddle the maximum blocksize issue with whether or not transaction fees will be sufficient to secure the network in the future. They are mostly orthogonal issues that should be discussed separately.
