  
There is not a donation address for the whole development team; if there was,
somebody would have to be in charge of keeping track of the bitcoins, deciding
what they should be spent on, etc.  
  
I don't want to be that somebody....  
  
If you like the wallet encryption feature, send bitcoins to:  
Matt Corallo : 1JBMattRztKDF2KRS3vhjJXA7h47NEsn2c  
and Jeff Garzik : 1BrufViLKnSWtuWGkryPsKsxonV2NQ7Tcj  
  
Matt (aka "BlueMatt" in IRC) did the hard work of making wallet encryption
happen, and deserves a ton of credit for being persistent and reworking
~~his~~ Jeff's initial implementation a few times based on feedback and
suggestions.  
  
Gregory Maxwell ('gmaxwell') also deserves credit and donations, he gave a lot
of feedback and did a lot of testing:  
gmaxwell : 1LjPAUKf23kDBy9sLJbiLfsvjde3ZdHcbJ  
  
(corrected to give Jeff credit for the initial implementation-- sorry Jeff!)
