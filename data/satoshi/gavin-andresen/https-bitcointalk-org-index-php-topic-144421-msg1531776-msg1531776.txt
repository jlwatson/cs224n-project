Why do people include transaction fees?  
  
Assuming the miner hasn't tweaked the reference code's parameters, the rules
are:  
  
Create at most a 250,000 byte block:  
\+ 27 kilobytes of space is set aside for the highest-priority transactions,
regardless of fee.  
\+ 223k of space left for fee-paying transactions.  
  
Transactions with a small number of inputs/outputs, transferring a large
number of bitcoins, that weren't recently received are the highest priority
and are included first.  
  
If you send a low-priority transaction without a fee you can end up waiting a
very long time for it to get confirmed (and it may never be confirmed).  
  
Why do miners include free transactions?  
  
Either they're too lazy to change the default rules, or they believe that
allowing free, high-priority transactions will help make Bitcoin more popular
and will, therefore, increase the value of their coins.  
  
Why is there any incentive to pay fees at all?  
  
You'll notice that pretty much every block nowadays is bigger than 27k, so
there IS competition for that free space. But if you've got 10 bitcoins that
have been sitting in your wallet for a week or three, you'll still have no
problem spending them without a fee (they'll have a much higher priority than
somebody playing SatoshiDice 100 times a day).
