Shouldn't it be able to fix itself without having to delete the block data?  
As long as everyone with an 'old' client stops generating, the bad fork should
get shorter and die?  
  
Just checking my understanding.  

Yep, you're right. The good fork is longer than the bad one now; the last
ORPHAN BLOCK my TEST bitcoind got was about 20 hours ago.
