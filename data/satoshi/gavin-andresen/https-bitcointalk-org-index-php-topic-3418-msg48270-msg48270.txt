I'm halfway through creating releases-- I had a 0.3.20 candidate Windows
release that didn't pass sanity testing (rendering issues that it looks like
are fixed with a wxWidgets upgrade).  
  
If all goes well, 0.3.20 for linux and pc will be up and available tomorrow,
0.3.20 for the mac "real soon now".  
  
If not... it will take longer.
