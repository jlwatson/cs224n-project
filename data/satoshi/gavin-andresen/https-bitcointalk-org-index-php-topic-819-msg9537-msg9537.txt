.... This system requires that the majority work according to the protocol in
any case.

The NY vending machine can only take the coin if it controls a lot of CPU
power and can generate a block, but the whole bitcoin system is built on the
assumption that the vast majority of CPU power is honest. And being honest
with my proposal means following the pseudocode above.  

Right, that's my issue with your proposal: what incentive does the NY vending
machine have to be honest? It can be "dishonest", ignore verifiers all-
together, and accept more transactions (better for it) with less work (also
better for it).
