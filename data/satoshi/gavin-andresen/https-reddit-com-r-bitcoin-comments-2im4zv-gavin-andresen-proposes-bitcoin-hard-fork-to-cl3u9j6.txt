Quoting myself: "There are other ideas for how to make Bitcoin scale, and whenever practical I like to choose “all of the above” for how to solve a problem, because nobody is smart enough to choose The One True Solution every time. So I won’t be surprised or disappointed if development wanders off this roadmap in a different direction."

So, yes, go for it-- implement off-chain solutions, too.
