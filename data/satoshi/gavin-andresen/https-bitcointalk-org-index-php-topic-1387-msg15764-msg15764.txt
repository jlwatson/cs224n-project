Attached is a little patch that expands the getnewaddress RPC command so it
can try to generate a "vanity" bitcoin address.  
E.g. I told it to generate an address with "gavin" in it, and it chugged away
for an hour or two and came up with:  
12kUimDnb1a6oAPifgavinAaxMmLe43UR6  
  
This is recommended for fun and experimentation only; it takes a long time,
and while it is trying to find an address with the right string in it no other
RPC commands are accepted. Including 'stop'.  
  
It'd be kinda cool (and would speed it up a lot) to make it case-insensitive.
Or to match to an arbitrary regular expression. Or to make it spin off a
separate thread and just return "working...." (and have the thread add the
address to the wallet when it is finally found, labeled with the vanity
string).  
  
Maybe we should have a Best Bitcoin Address contest
