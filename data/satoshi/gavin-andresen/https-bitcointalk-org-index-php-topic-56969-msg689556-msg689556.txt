I just pulled p2sh into master, replacing the OP_EVAL code that I pulled last
month before the controversy erupted.  
  
If you think it is a bad idea, then don't use it. Hopefully it will inspire
you to prove that I'm an idiot and completely wrong about people continuing to
use 30-something-character "bitcoin addresses" for the next year or three.
