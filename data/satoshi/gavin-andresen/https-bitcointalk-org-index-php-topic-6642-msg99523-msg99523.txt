hmm, with new version i can't send 0.01 BTC without fee  
0.3.20.2 works fine  

  
You're running into the "very low priority transactions require a fee" rule.
Priority depends on the value of the transaction (fewer bitcoins == lower
priority) and how long ago you received the bitcoin(s) (older == higher
priority).  
  
That rule was in place for 0.3.20.2, but only for most miners. Most would not
include very-low-priority transaction in blocks until they were old enough to
have a high priority. The result was a big backlog of very-small transactions
starting to build up.  
  
With 0.3.21, the rules are the same for miners, for relaying transactions
across the network, and for the user interface-- if your transaction is very-
low-priority, it won't get relayed and the user interface will insist that you
pay a fee if you really want it transmitted RIGHT NOW.  
  
If you really really really need to send 0.01 bitcoins right now, then you'll
have to pay the fee. If you're willing to wait a while, you'll find you can
send it without a fee after it is old enough and has enough priority.  
  
All of this is to discourage people from "penny flooding" -- constantly
sending pennies back and forth to themselves without a fee just because they
can.  
  
Footnote: if you don't upgrade, you can send that 0.01 bitcoins without a fee.
But as everybody else upgrades, you'll find that it will take a long time for
that transaction to get confirmed.
