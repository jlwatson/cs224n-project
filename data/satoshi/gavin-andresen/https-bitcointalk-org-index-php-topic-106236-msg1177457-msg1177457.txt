  
debug.log might tell you why it is being rejected. Some reasons it might be
rejected:  
  
\+ You're re-using an input that has already been spent.  
\+ Sum(outputs) is greater than Sum(inputs)  
\+ signrawtransaction was unable to sign all of the inputs (it did not report
"complete" : true )  
  
By the way: be EXTREMELY careful with the raw transactions API. You can easily
forget to include a change output and create transactions with huge fees; test
your code thoroughly on testnet before putting it into production.
