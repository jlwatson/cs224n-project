From another thread:  
  
No need to embed the identification in the transactions, I don't think. You
just need to associate your public keys with 'you' at some place where anybody
can see that association and prove that you originally owned the private keys
associated with those public keys.  
  
Let's see, I think something like this would work:  
  
For every private key in your wallet:  
Grab the corresponding public key  
Sign it with the private key  
Compute SHA256(public key, signature, "your name and email address")  
  
Then upload all of those SHA256 hashes to some secure central database
somewhere, which stores it along with the time it was uploaded.  
  
Now if somebody copies your wallet and spends your coins, you can prove that
you had the public/private keys in the past by showing everybody the (public
key, signature, "your name and email address") that hashes to the value in the
central database.  
  
The crook can upload their own SHA256, of course-- this relies on you
uploading before the crook.
