I wonder who controls that twitter account.

I noticed I was blocked a few weeks ago and privately complained (and was unblocked-- didn't get an explanation of why I was blocked in the first place, though).

I figured maybe it was an honest mistake, so didn't kick up a fuss. It obviously wasn't an honest mistake, but a purposeful shutdown of communication.

I know there are good people working on Core, but they need to purge the poisonous people who keep doing underhanded crap that makes the project look bad.
