0.001 BTC at today's exchange rate is uncomfortably close to the estimated
network-wide cost of processing a bitcoin transaction (which is about 0.001 US
dollars).  
  
The danger is a flood of micro-transactions that keep everybody's CPUs busy,
driving up that hidden cost and, eventually driving people to stop running
bitcoin because the costs aren't worth the benefits.  
  
  
Also: lets not confuse the "how many free transactions" with "what is the
smallest transaction amount you can send."
