As an experiment, I've uploaded a Mac .dmg disk image with 0.4rc2 binaries to:  
https://github.com/downloads/bitcoin/bitcoin/  
  
I'd like to switch from sourceforge to github for binary release downloads,
because sourceforge doesn't support https for downloads.  
  
Help improving the script I used to create the .dmg file would be most
appreciated; see this branch for what I done did:

 ~~For some reason setting the "Drag and drop to install" background image
isn't working...  
  
shasum checksum is:

Fixed. New shasum checksum is:
