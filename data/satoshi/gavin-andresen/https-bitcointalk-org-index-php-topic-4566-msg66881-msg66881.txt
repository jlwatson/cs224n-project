I got this question from an editor at TechWorld.com.au :  

Quote

You are originally from Melbourne, and I noticed an Australian was prepared to
trade a car for Bitcoins. Any other stories like that you can share? Any news
on Bitcoin activity in Australia?  

  
... and I'm looking for good answers.
