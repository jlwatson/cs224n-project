First: it looks like we're in the middle of our first Bitcoin Bubble. Price
today went from about 0.8 US cents to 1.4 US cents on the Bitcoin Market.
Maybe the price won't crash back down... will be interesting to see what
happens.  
  
Second, RE: lending: I think it's going to be really hard to establish enough
trust to create a lending bitcoin bank. I base that on my experiences dabbling
as a Prosper.com lender; when hard times hit, repaying your Bitcoin debts will
be WAAAAY down on the priority list.  
  
Instead, I think we'll see Ponzi schemes masquerading as lending banks. Buyer
beware!
