We're pretty close to being able to duplicate the bitcoin GUI using the RPC.  
  
I think the only thing missing is reporting bitcoin addresses in
listtransactions. That gets a little sticky with multisends (one transactions
that sends coins to multiple recipients); here's what I'm thinking of
implementing after doing some brainstorming with theymos/jgarzik/nanotube in
IRC chat and running a couple of 'multisend' tests on the test network:  
  

Code:

"category" : "receive",  
"amount" : amount,  
"address" : "bitcoinaddress"

... plus the rest of what is reported now  
(account/txid/confirmations/time/comment). That's the "received on"  
address, of course.  
  
On the send side, I'm leaning towards:  

Code:

"category" : "send",  
"amount" : amount,  
"fee" : fee,  
"toaddress" : { "address" : amount } # or "toaddress" : { "address" : amount,
"address" : amount } for a multisend.

... plus the rest of what is reported now  
(account/txid/confirmations/time/comment).  
  
I don't like that the common case looks kind of ugly; I'd much prefer  
just

Code:

"address" : "bitcoinaddress"

  
That could be done by having listtransactions report multiple category:send
entries for a multisend... except it is not obvious  
which one should report the fee, if there is a fee. First one? All of them?  
  
I'm also a worried that websites might get their accounting wrong if they're
not prepared to deal with multisends; making "toaddress" an  
Object makes it obvious that multisends are possible. The only way a website
would get a multisend would be if they allow users to import keys from their
local bitcoin wallet, which nobody is doing... yet.  
  
  
Here's how listtransactions currently reports a complex multisend:  
  

Code:

{  
"account" : "Test3",  
"category" : "receive",  
"amount" : 3.03000000,  
"confirmations" : 66,  
"txid" :  
"36c86ca499275945a3f1805d6e070ac00b2d32e5e16a4c9cf2c83b189a347d88",  
"time" : 1292532062,  
"comment" : "multisend, Test1 to Test2 and Test3 twice (same addr)"  
},  
{  
"account" : "Test3",  
"category" : "receive",  
"amount" : 3.00000000,  
"confirmations" : 66,  
"txid" :  
"36c86ca499275945a3f1805d6e070ac00b2d32e5e16a4c9cf2c83b189a347d88",  
"time" : 1292532062,  
"comment" : "multisend, Test1 to Test2 and Test3 twice (same addr)"  
},  
{  
"account" : "Test2",  
"category" : "receive",  
"amount" : 2.00000000,  
"confirmations" : 66,  
"txid" :  
"36c86ca499275945a3f1805d6e070ac00b2d32e5e16a4c9cf2c83b189a347d88",  
"time" : 1292532062,  
"comment" : "multisend, Test1 to Test2 and Test3 twice (same addr)"  
},  
{  
"account" : "Test1",  
"category" : "send",  
"amount" : -8.03000000,  
"fee" : 0.00000000,  
"confirmations" : 66,  
"txid" :  
"36c86ca499275945a3f1805d6e070ac00b2d32e5e16a4c9cf2c83b189a347d88",  
"time" : 1292532062,  
"comment" : "multisend, Test1 to Test2 and Test3 twice (same addr)"  
},
