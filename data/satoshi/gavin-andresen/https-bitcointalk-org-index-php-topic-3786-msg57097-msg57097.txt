That seems like an internationalization bug. What was wrong with using the
correct localization?  

  
I was tempted to do more than fix the rounding problem...

If you'd like to start a discussion of whether or not it is a good idea for
one-thousand German bitcoin amounts to be displayed as "1.000,00", be my
guest. I think there was such a discussion in the past, but I didn't pay
attention to it. I think it would be nice if an amount like "1.001 BTC" (or
even "1.001 tonal bitcoins") was unambiguous.  
  
RE: subcent throwaway change: turn it into a proper PULL request (yes, you'll
have to-- horrors! -- use that evil, not 100%-pure-open-source github) and
it'll happen faster.
