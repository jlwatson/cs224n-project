PS: Anyone can recommend some kind of automatic backup software for Linux?  

  
My automatic backup strategy is:  
  
Cron task that runs a shell script twice a day.  
  
The shell script does:  
call bitcoind backupwallet to create a time/date-stamped wallet file  
gpg encrypt the wallet with my public key  
copy the result to an off-machine backup location  
(I'm using Amazon S3, which is itself redundantly backed up to multiple
geographic locations automatically)  
  
Shell script looks like:  

Code:

#!/usr/bin/env bash  
  
GPGU="Gavin Andresen"  
  
TS=$(date "+%Y%m%d-%H-%M")  
  
WALLET=/tmp/clearcoinwallet${TS}  
WALLET_E=/tmp/clearcoinwallet${TS}.crypt  
  
~/bin/bitcoind backupwallet $WALLET  
/usr/bin/gpg -r "$GPGU" --output $WALLET_E --encrypt $WALLET  
~/bin/s3cmd put $WALLET_E s3://NAME_OF_MY_S3_BUCKET  
rm $WALLET $WALLET_E  

  
I'd suggest doing something similar (replace the s3cmd with an scp to copy
somewhere if you're not an S3 user; you could even ftp somewhere, since the
wallet is encrypted it doesn't matter if somebody is eavesdropping).
