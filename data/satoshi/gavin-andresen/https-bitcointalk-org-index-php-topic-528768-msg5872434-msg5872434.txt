Sounds familiar...  
  
... I think I ran into a similar problem that turned out to be ssh being upset
that the file permissions on the id_dsa file used to login to the virtual
machine were too permissive (because I was running from a FAT32-formatted USB
stick that didn't support file permissions at all, if I recall correctly,
which I probably don't).
