Couple years ago it was "Don't talk to the CIA! They're Evil, and will Destroy
Bitcoin!"  
  
Now it is "Don't get involved in DC lobbying! That's Evil, and will Destroy
Bitcoin!"  
  
In a few more years, I bet it'll be "Don't go to the United Nations! They're
Evil, and will Destroy Bitcoin!"  
  
I'll quote myself from a related thread on google+
