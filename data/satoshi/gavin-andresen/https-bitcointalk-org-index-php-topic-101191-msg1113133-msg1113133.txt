From the whitepaper:  
  
I'd have to think about it a lot harder than I'm willing to right now to be
absolutely sure, but that seems like a mistake to me.  
  
If peers have to fetch inputs and compute coin age to determine whether or not
a chain is longest then it seems like that could be leveraged into a denial-
of-service attack. Because an attacker could do minimal proof-of-work (or
proof-of-stake) but then broadcast a chain with _JUST_ a little-less consumed
coin age than the current best chain.  
  
Their chain will be rejected, but their peers will waste time figuring out
that it should be rejected.  
  
Also note that Bitcoin does NOT use total proof-of-work-performed to determine
the best chain; it uses total proof-of-work-target. That's deliberate; if it
used proof-of-work-performed, then if you happened to get lucky and found an
extremely small block hash you could hold on to it, build on top of it, and
only announce your "more proof of work" chain when the network chain's work
started to catch up with your secret chain.
