listunspent output is designed to be read by machines, not people, and its
output is designed to go directly into createrawtransaction.  
  
If you need all the human-friendly details of a transaction, use
getrawtransaction <txid> 1  
  
I'm against adding "address" to the listunspent output, because most of the
time it will be unused and sometimes it would just not appear at all (because
not all scriptPubKeys are bitcoin addresses).
