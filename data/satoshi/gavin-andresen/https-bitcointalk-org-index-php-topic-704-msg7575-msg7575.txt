I just shut down freebitcoins.appspot.com; it looks like somebody in Spain is
being a jerk and getting a new IP address, bitcoin address, and solving the
captcha. Over and over and over again:  
  

Code:

79.154.133.217 - - [04/Aug/2010:12:46:55 -0700]  
"POST / HTTP/1.1" 200 1294 "https://freebitcoins.appspot.com/"  
"Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.0; U; es-LA) Presto/2.6.30 Version/10.60,gzip(gfe)"  
  
79.146.112.13 - - [04/Aug/2010:12:45:20 -0700]  
"POST / HTTP/1.1" 200 1294 "https://freebitcoins.appspot.com/"  
"Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.0; U; es-LA) Presto/2.6.30 Version/10.60,gzip(gfe)"  
  
81.44.159.81 - - [04/Aug/2010:12:42:20 -0700]  
"POST / HTTP/1.1" 200 1294 "https://freebitcoins.appspot.com/"  
"Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.0; U; es-LA) Presto/2.6.30 Version/10.60,gzip(gfe)"

Those IP addresses all map to Telefonica de Espana. If it was you: give them
back, please: 15VjRaDX9zpbA8LVnbrCAFzrVzN7ixHNsC  
  
Now that 5 bitcoins is worth a fair bit, I'm thinking I need more cheating
countermeasures. I can think of four things to try:  
  
1\. Rate limit based on the first byte of the IP address (79. or 81. in this
case).  
2\. Rate limit based on the USER-AGENT string ("Opera/9.8..." in this case).  
3\. Rate limit based on last two domains of reverse DNS lookup of the IP
address (rima-tde.net in this case).  
4\. Make the standard amount given away 0.5 Bitcoins (Bitcoins have gone up 10
times in value since I started the Faucet).  
  
If you get rate limited, you'll get a message that asks you to try again
tomorrow.  
  
BitcoinFX: thanks again for the donation to the faucet; I'm going to drain the
Faucet below 500 coins temporarily, and will refill it with your donation
after the new cheating countermeasures are in place.
