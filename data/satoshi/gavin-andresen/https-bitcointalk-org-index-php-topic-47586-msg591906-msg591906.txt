You might want to include a note in the instructions about this.  

  
You == me?  
  
There's a sticky here about creating a pull request, it'd be most excellent if
you could make you==you and fix the doc/readme-qt.rst file.  
  
I'll try hard to remember to mention this for the 0.5 release notes, but I'll
warn you I'm really good at forgetting things.
