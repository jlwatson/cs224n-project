What's funny?  
  
A server lying about whether or not your transactions are valid would be like
your ISP lying about whether or not your HTTP requests are valid or not.  
  
If they lie, you'll very quickly find another service provider (or download a
Bitcoin iPhone app that doesn't suck and say that your transactions are
invalid).
