So final question - is the designer or designers planning on implementing
(into the core) a secure system, so none of this nonsense is a problem
anymore?  

  
I'm not the designer of Bitcoin (I am one of the developers), but I **have**
been thinking a lot about what it will take to make it safe(r) for my grandma
to use.  
  
playanaut, I'd love to hear your suggestions on how to make bitcoin better.
And (shameless plug): I'd also love to know if you think my latest project,
ClearCoin, is a step in the right direction.
