By tweaking some caching settings, a rather spectacular speed increase for
loading a block chain was obtained. This will probably end up in 0.6 still.  

I pulled #964 for 0.6 this morning.  
  
I had played with database settings several months ago and saw no speedup
because there was another bug causing a bottleneck. That bug was fixed a while
ago, but nobody thought to try tweaking the db settings again until a few days
ago.  
  
Pieter and Greg did all the hard work of doing a lot of benchmarking to figure
out which settings actually matter.  
  
PS: the database settings are run-time configurable for any version of
bitcoin; berkeley db reads a file called 'DB_CONFIG' (if it exists) in the
"database environment" directory (aka -datadir).
