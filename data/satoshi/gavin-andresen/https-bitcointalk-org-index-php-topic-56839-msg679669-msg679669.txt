I hate to inject gloom and doom into a fun topic like vanity bitcoin
addresses... but y'all should be aware that one of my longer-term goals for
the Bitcoin system is to make bitcoin addresses disappear. I hope Bitcoin
software 10 years from now tells users "You're about to pay 11 micro-Bitcoins
to Amazon.com" and not "2mRwtf8blahblahblah". And I'm not alone, I know Mike
Hearn feels strongly about making bitcoin addresses go away for ordinary
users.  
  
If you do spent lots of time creating The World's Best system for mining
vanity bitcoin addresses, please don't be upset or surprised if you find it is
obsolete when " ** _Bitcoin 2017 Turbo++ Enhanced Edition_** " is released.
