correction: bitcoin-qt/bitcoind command-line arguments have a single-dash, so
it would be  
bitcoin-qt -server  
  
Since you have to set a rpcuser/rpcpassword in the bitcoin.conf file for
-server to work anyway, you might want to put "server=1" in the bitcoin.conf
file instead of using the command-line argument...
