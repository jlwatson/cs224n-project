I launched a new version of the Bitcoin Faucet today, with a few changes:  
  
1\. Payout is now 0.02 bitcoins (down from 0.05), to reflect the rise in value
of bitcoins versus other currencies.  
  
2\. Recent Sends page, showing scrambled email addresses and (not scrambled)
IP addresses of the last 100 people to get coins from the Faucet.  
  
3\. Behind the scenes, faucet payouts are bundled up and sent in batches every
N minutes, to minimize the fees that the Faucet pays.  
  
I want to recruit some trusted volunteers to be "Faucet Police" -- if somebody
notices a fishy pattern of either IP addresses or email addresses, I'll give
the Faucet Police the ability to temporarily stop the flow of coins from the
Faucet.  
  
If you're willing to help out and you've got a good reputation/history here on
the forums, email me (gavinandresen@gmail.com) your google account information
along with what time zone you're usually in, and I'll try to pick a couple
handfuls of people so no matter what time of day or night, somebody will be
awake and ready to turn off the spigot.
