No, I bet nobody knows if or how TD F 90-22.1 applies to Bitcoin.  
  
I am not a lawyer, but I bet the IRS would say that you should report any
funds greater than $10,000 held by non-US bitcoin exchanges or wallet
services.  
  
I don't know what the IRS would say about Bitcoins held on a server that you
control but that happens to be located outside the US, or if it would matter
if they were also held on your computer or printed out and stored in a safe
deposit box somewhere in Kentucky.
