He/she/they want an easier way for The Crowd to control The Policy-- right
now, if you know enough C++ to modify and compile your own version of Bitcoin
and can convince enough other people to use your version, then you can change
Policy.  
  
Allowing everybody to tweak Policy and having some sort of mechanism that
figures out what "everybody" wants to do is an interesting idea. I have no
idea how you could actually make it work, and it would open up a whole other
can of potential security problems (what if somebody controls a bunch of IP
addresses and decides to "vote" for a policy that benefits them? or can you
tie the policy changes to proof-of-work somehow? How do you aggregate what
"everybody" thinks in a non-spoofable way? etc etc etc)...
