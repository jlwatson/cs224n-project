No, actually, in the current source code it never gets lowered:  

Code:

// Retarget  
CBigNum bnNew;  
bnNew.SetCompact(pindexLast->nBits);  
bnNew *= nActualTimespan;  
bnNew /= nTargetTimespan;  
  
if (bnNew > bnProofOfWorkLimit)  
bnNew = bnProofOfWorkLimit;  
  
/// debug print  
printf("GetNextWorkRequired RETARGET\n");  

There's no "else if (bnNew < ...something)"  
  
 **UPDATE** : rodin is right, I'm wrong. bnProofOfWorkLimit is a constant, and
this code just make sure the proof of work never gets too easy.
