I've been working on adding -port= / -rpcport= command line / config file
options to bitcoin. The idea is to let you run multiple copies of bitcoind on
one machine; I need this because I'm planning on having at least two Bitcoin-
related web services (the Bitcoin Faucet and a service to be named later), I
want them to have completely separate wallets, but I don't want to rent
multiple servers to host them.  
  
Usage looks like this:  

Code:

$ ./bitcoind getbalance # The TEST network Faucet bitcoind  
40616.66159265000  
$ ./bitcoind -datadir=/home/bitcoin/.bitcoinTEST2 getbalance  
1000.000000000000  
$ cat /home/bitcoin/.bitcoinTEST2/bitcoin.conf  
rpcpassword=.....  
port=18666  
rpcport=18665  

  
Satoshi pointed out that allowing bitcoin/bitcoind to run on a non-standard
port could be dangerous, because if misconfigured two bitcoins might both open
and write to the same database. To prevent that, the <datadir>/db.log file is
used as a lock so only one bitcoin can access the same datadir at a time (uses
boost::interprocess::file_lock, which is purported to be cross-platform and
well-behaved, even if bitcoin crashes).  
  
Issues that came up as I was doing this:  
  
I left a call to wxSingleInstanceChecker in the Windows GUI code, so no
multiple-gui-bitcoins-listening-on-different-ports on Windows. I don't do
Windows...  
  
I didn't bother making the error handling graceful if you point two bitcoins
at the same datadir (you get a runtime exception "Cannot lock db.log, is
bitcoin already running?").  
  
Patches are at http://pastebin.com/2e4hfXSS; I've only tested on Linux so far,
anybody willing to try this on Windows?
