  
I don't think that belongs in Bitcoin-- I like solutions like i2p or ssh
tunneling that put encryption down at the lower network layer (where it
belongs, in my humble opinion).  
  
  
Are you worried about SourceForge and GitHub (the two 'official' trees) being
forced, or deciding, to drop bitcoin? At this point lots of developers have
their own copies of the source code, I'm sure if that happened another site
(maybe a hidden monotone repository inside the anonymous i2p network) would
spring up.  
  
They can't stop the signal...
