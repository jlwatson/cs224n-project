I guess when all you have is laissez-faire capitialism everything starts to
look like a market nail.  

  
I'd just like a rational system where policy changes are proposed along with
specific, testable predictions for those policy changes.  
  
Then the policy change is adopted. Evaluated after a little while.  
  
And accepted or rejected based on whether or not the policy change had the
intended effect.  
  
Then maybe we could take turns adopting our favorite policies, and see if that
nice liberal "inequality reducing" policy actually, you know, reduces
inequality (and we could argue about whether it is OK to do if it reduces
inequality by making rich people a lot less rich and poor people a little more
poor).  
  
Or if that nice libertarian "cost saving" policy actually, you know, saves
money (and we could argue about whether the cost savings is worth it if it
increases our chances of getting a scalp infection from an unlicensed barber).
