I think this comment says it all about Peter's way of thinking.

Anybody who even SUGGESTS that an issue might not be black and white is painted as "huge risk of making things fail catastrophically."

I want to live in a world where people can express their opinions openly, with rational debate and a lot of respect for the idea that NOBODY has a monopoly on the truth.
