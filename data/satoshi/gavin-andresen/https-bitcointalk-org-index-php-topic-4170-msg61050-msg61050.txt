  
You're browsing the web and see a link or button that says "Pay now with
Bitcoin"-- you click it, and... stuff happens. Where that stuff does NOT
involve copying and pasting anything (I know WE all know how to copy and
paste, but a surprising number of computer users don't) and certainly doesn't
involve trying to type in a 35-character bitcoin address.
