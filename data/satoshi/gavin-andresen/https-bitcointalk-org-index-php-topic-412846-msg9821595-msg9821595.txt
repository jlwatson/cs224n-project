  
Huh what? Field report from my talk at the CFR?  
  
I barely remember it, there were probably 50 people in suits in the audience,
nobody I recognized. The whole thing is on video, there were no secret
meetings, I got there 10 minutes before my talk and left 10 minutes after (I
had a bunch of interviews with DC-based journalists scheduled... and I think
that was the trip I had lunch with Jim Harper and got a tour of Cato, although
I might be mis-remembering).
