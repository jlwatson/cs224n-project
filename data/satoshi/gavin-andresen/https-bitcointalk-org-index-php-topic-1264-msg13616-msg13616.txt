3\. I want to be able to put the payment address into MyBitcoin and see the
status of my payment.  

  
I shoulda been more clear: I've now got a 1.11 payment to {some random
address} in Bitcoin; I want to take that {some random address} and give it to
MyBitcoin (or you, the merchant) and see what's up with that payment. Ideally,
it would pick up the payment process as if the PAYMENT TIMED OUT never
happened.  
  
And MadHatter: keep the change.
