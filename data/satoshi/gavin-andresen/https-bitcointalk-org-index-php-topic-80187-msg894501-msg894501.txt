Pieter fixed the "100% usage on OSX bug" and I created and uploaded a fixed
version 0.6.2.2 especially for the Mac.  
  
RE: upgrading: the best upgrade practice is to:  
  
1) Backup your wallet someplace safe (if you're running an 0.6 release then
use the Backup Wallet menu item).  
2) Shutdown. Make sure Bitcoin isn't still in your system tray-- don't just
close the window, shut it down.  
3) Wait a minute or two (it can take older versions a minute or two to
completely shut down)  
4) Install and run the new version.
