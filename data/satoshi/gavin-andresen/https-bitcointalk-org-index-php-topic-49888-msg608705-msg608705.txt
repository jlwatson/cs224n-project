Any Bitcoin developers care to fix this problem?  

  
Let me think... a problem that affects a small number of people... means you
end up with 8 connections instead of more than 8... and has an easy, obvious
workaround... and if fixed will be difficult to test thoroughly...  
  
Not high on my priority list.  
  
Things that ARE high on my priority list:  
  
\+ Getting the 0.5 release out the door  
\+ Improving initial startup and block download times  
\+ Solutions for wallet security and backup
