RE: botnets: if the botnet operator is economically rational, then their best
strategy to make money is to just follow the rules, mine coins, and then sell
them on the exchanges.  
  
RE: the original poster's question on "can somebody with lots of money and a
willingness to spend it to mess with the bitcoin exchange rate and cause fear,
uncertainty and doubt" :  
  
Yes. Yes, they can. That will be true while the bitcoin economy is small, and
that is why I tell people not to 'invest' money in bitcoins that they can't
afford to lose.  
  
I still predict that there will be natural price bubbles and artificial ponzi
schemes and all sorts of other things causing wild swings in the value of
bitcoins. Next time I talk to an economist who knows something about currency
markets I'll have to ask how big a currency has to be before it is mostly
immune from speculative bubbles and price manipulation...
