RE: "wasting" addresses:  
  
caveden is right, this patch generates and throws away lots and lots of
potential bitcoin addresses.  
  
But there are 2^160 possible bitcoin addresses, which is a really, really big
number. The chances of BioMike generating an address that matches my "gavin"
address before we're all dead is approximately zero.  
  
And davidonpda: I haven't tried to figure out how long 10 characters would
take-- it is exponential in the number of characters, so 10 characters would
probably take years...
