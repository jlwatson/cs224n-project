In case you don't subscribe to the bitcoin-development mailing list, we've
been talking about a new BIP:  
  
"Bitcoin blocks and transactions are versioned binary structures. Both
currently use version 1. This BIP introduces an upgrade path for versioned
transactions and blocks. A unique value is added to newly produced coinbase
transactions, and blocks are updated to version 2."  
  
Full BIP: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0034  
Mailing list discussion:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29505990  
Pull request that implements BIP 34:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1526  
BIP16 "Lessons learned" : https://gist.github.com/2355445  
  
I'd like to keep most discussion on the bitcoin-development mailing and not
here on the forums, although I do plan on posting to one of the mining boards
to warn solo miners and pool operators that they will eventually need to
upgrade (I expect it will take at least a year and probably two or more for
95% of hashing power to upgrade, which is the proposed timeframe for full BIP
34 support).
