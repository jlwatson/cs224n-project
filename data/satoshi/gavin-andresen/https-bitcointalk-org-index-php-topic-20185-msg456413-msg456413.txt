Update:  
  
The EFF donation account/address was at mybitcoin, so half of them are gone.  
  
I received 1,879 from the mybitcoin claims process. They are now safe in an
offline, encrypted wallet; here is the transaction:

According to block explorer, 3515.06 BTC were donated to the donation address
I had for them:  
http://blockexplorer.com/address/1MCwBbhNGp5hRm5rC1Aims2YFRe2SXPYKt  
  
49% of that would have been about 1,722 BTC, not 1,879. I'm guessing the
difference is because of donations from other mybitcoin customers just
crediting the eff account without generating a block-chain transaction.  
  
Before sending coins to the Faucet, I think I'll create a patch to always send
"change" to the same address, so it is really easy to keep track of these
bitcoins and make sure they're not sent anywhere other than the Faucet.
