Maintaining the faucet isn't a big drain on my time-- most days I don't think
about it.  
  
Given the number of newbies who wander into #bitcoin-dev and mention they got
0.05 BTC from the faucet, I think it is still valuable as a nice introduction
to using bitcoin.  
  
And Jim: thanks! Without donations the Faucet would have run out of coins long
ago...
