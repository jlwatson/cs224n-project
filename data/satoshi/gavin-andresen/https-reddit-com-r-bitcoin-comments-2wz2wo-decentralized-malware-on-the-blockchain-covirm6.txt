There was a similar paper at the IFCA'15 Bitcoin workshop: http://fc15.ifca.ai/preproceedings/bitcoin/paper_15.pdf

During the Q&A for that paper a clear consensus emerged that it would make more sense to use the Bitcoin p2p network for botnet command and control, but it really doesn't make sense to store either commands or payloads in the blockchain. Mostly because it is a really bad idea to leave a permanent public record of your criminal activity, but also because it is expensive.
