Chaining not-yet-signed transactions is impossible because transaction inputs
are identified by the previous transaction's hash, and the transaction's hash
includes everything about the transaction, including the signatures.  
  
A multisignature transaction taking funds from #1 and paying them to #4 that
requires signatures from #1, #2, and #3 should accomplish the same thing,
though.
