I'd read somewhere it was vulnerable to a "man-in-the-middle" attack. Not sure
what that means, but I figured it'd be good to be careful.  

  
To be completely sure you get all the donations you deserve, you should put
the donation address on an http **s** :// page.  
  
Otherwise hackers can hijack http: pages if they can insert themselves into
the network between you and your web visitors, and replace the donation
address on the webpage with their bitcoin address.
