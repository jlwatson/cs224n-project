Auto-reset once a month... very interesting idea.  
  
It'd make a mess of peoples' testnet wallets-- they'd be full of orphaned
0-confirmation transactions. But deleting your testnet wallet once a month
wouldn't be that big a burden, and that should prevent people from trading
testnet coins as if they were worth something.  
  
Somebody who wanted to be annoying could still drive up difficulty after every
reset and make life miserable for anybody testing their new exchange or
merchant software, though.  
  
The problem with **just** doing more frequent difficulty adjustments is
somebody with lots of hashing power can still over-write huge parts of the
chain whenever they like. I suppose you could argue that bitcoin services
should be written so that they can handle suddenly getting a 600-block-long
chain-reorg... but that just does NOT happen on the real bitcoin network.  
  
More hare-brained thoughts: could automatic block-chain lock-ins for the
testnet be implemented somehow? Fetch a block depth/hash pair from a website
somebody volunteers to create (auto-updated once a day...) ?
