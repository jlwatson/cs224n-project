  
I was actually thinking of a minute or three of proof-of-work on initial
connection, not when submitting a transaction, but requiring some proof-of-
work for every transaction submitted into the network IS a very interesting
idea! Should be straightforward to implement, too (add a nonce and either a
full or partial hash to the transaction)...
