\+ require some proof-of-work as part of the client-to-client connection
process (helps prevent 'Sybil' attacks).  

  
Isn't that a brilliant idea? Like hashcash?  
  
You would be required to hash the string of the transaction, with a proof of
work, that would say, take 5 seconds to calculate on a modern PC. Checking the
POW just like in bitcoin would be easy and very quick for the receiving
machines, but would stop a flood attack of random data without the attacker
having limitless CPU power.  

  
I was actually thinking of a minute or three of proof-of-work on initial
connection, not when submitting a transaction, but requiring some proof-of-
work for every transaction submitted into the network IS a very interesting
idea! Should be straightforward to implement, too (add a nonce and either a
full or partial hash to the transaction)...
