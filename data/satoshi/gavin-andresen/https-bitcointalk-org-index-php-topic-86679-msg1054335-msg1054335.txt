It isn't dooommmmzz but it does distort the market. Luckily it is self
correcting. As tx volume increases and tx fees increase the block subsidy will
decline and make the network more of a "pay per performance" model.  

Self-correcting assuming there are good market dynamics between miners and
users. That's broken right now, but I'm working on fixing it (see pull #1590
for the first step).
