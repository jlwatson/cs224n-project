Pieter is exactly right. The current code is extremely conservative with
multisig addresses, only counting them as yours if the wallet contains **all**
the private keys.  
  
Loosening that to considering them yours if you have enough keys to spend
might happen, although I am worried that might cause vulnerabilities for
applications that make the implicit assumption that if they have the key
necessary to spend that means nobody else can possibly spend those coins after
6 confirmations. If it is a 1of2 multisig that wouldn't be true.
