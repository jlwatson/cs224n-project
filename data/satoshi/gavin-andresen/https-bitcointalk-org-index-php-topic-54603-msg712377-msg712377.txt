  
I've been very clear about my top development priorities:  
  
1\. Network stability: DoS threats, scaling-up issues, etc.  
2\. Wallet security/backup.  
  
I see everything else as lower priority; I want users to be confident that
their bitcoins can't get stolen even if they slip up and open an attachment in
Outlook that the aughtn't have opened before I want a downloads-the-entire-
blockchain-in-10-seconds client with all sorts of other bells and whistles.
