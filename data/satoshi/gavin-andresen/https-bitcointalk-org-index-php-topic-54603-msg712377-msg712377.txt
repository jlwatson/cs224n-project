yeah lots of great features and improvements left alone for the supposedly
ultimate feature... p2sh (multi redeem) or what it's name is  
  
we need sweep now, fast initial blockchain download and lots more. I'm really
disappointed atm  

  
I've been very clear about my top development priorities:  
  
1\. Network stability: DoS threats, scaling-up issues, etc.  
2\. Wallet security/backup.  
  
I see everything else as lower priority; I want users to be confident that
their bitcoins can't get stolen even if they slip up and open an attachment in
Outlook that the aughtn't have opened before I want a downloads-the-entire-
blockchain-in-10-seconds client with all sorts of other bells and whistles.
