From a private email conversation to a Core developer about head-first mining:

The attack you describe is ludicrous. Silly. Not worth thinking about for more than eleven minutes.

The attack is:

Miner creates invalid block that takes a long time to (more than 30 seconds) to validate, and contains payment to SPV-running target accepting 2-confirm payments.
Network starts hashing on invalid block, and about 5% of the time will mine an empty block in that 30 seconds.
SPV client sees two confirmations, sends attacker something valuable.

Cost of the attack: bitcoin price * mining reward / 5% success rate == $200,000 at today's prices.

Really?  Seriously?  Somebody or several somebodies running SPV with 2 confirmations with no legal recourse will send an attacker more than $200,000 worth of stuff is in your attack model?
