Gavin, your ClearCoin project holds bitcoins on deposits. Can you direct me to
the security standards that you are adhering to? Has a 3rd party audit been
peformed to ensure that your organization is adhering to those standards? Have
you subjected your infrastructure to any kind of penetration tests? If I have
1000 btc in escrow at ClearCoin and an act of God wipes out your server at
2:15PM on a Sunday afternoon, is money safe and recoverable?  

  
No, no, no and yes. I'm planning on making the answers to all of those
questions "yes" within the next six months, although I need to look at how
many bitcoins are contained at any given time in the ClearCoin wallet; it
might make more sense to send double or triple that amount of bitcoin to a
publicly verifiable address, prove I own the coins, and guarantee any losses
due to ClearCoin getting hacked.  
  
(note: I just looked, and right now there are 540 bitcoins in the ClearCoin
wallet, so spending $50,000 to protect them really wouldn't make sense).

More to the point, how can I or anyone affordably provide the same kind of
fault tolerance and data security that a traditional banking institution
would?  

  
Yet another bitcoin chicken-and-egg problem that will get solved by investors
taking a risk and giving bitcoin entrepreneurs the resources to do security
right (or wealthy entrepreneurs stepping up and making the investment
themselves).
