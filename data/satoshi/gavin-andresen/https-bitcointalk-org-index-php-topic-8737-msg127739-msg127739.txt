  
No, no, no and yes. I'm planning on making the answers to all of those
questions "yes" within the next six months, although I need to look at how
many bitcoins are contained at any given time in the ClearCoin wallet; it
might make more sense to send double or triple that amount of bitcoin to a
publicly verifiable address, prove I own the coins, and guarantee any losses
due to ClearCoin getting hacked.  
  
(note: I just looked, and right now there are 540 bitcoins in the ClearCoin
wallet, so spending $50,000 to protect them really wouldn't make sense).  
  
  
Yet another bitcoin chicken-and-egg problem that will get solved by investors
taking a risk and giving bitcoin entrepreneurs the resources to do security
right (or wealthy entrepreneurs stepping up and making the investment
themselves).
