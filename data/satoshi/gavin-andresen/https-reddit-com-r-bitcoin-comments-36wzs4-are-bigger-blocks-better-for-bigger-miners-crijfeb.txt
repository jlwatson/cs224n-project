The topology for that test was the two 30% miners each connected to three of the 10% miners (not the same three), and the four 10% miners completely connected to each other.

It is easy to create config files with as many miners and whatever connectivity you want to test, so you should see what happens when mining power and network connectivity follows a power law distribution....
