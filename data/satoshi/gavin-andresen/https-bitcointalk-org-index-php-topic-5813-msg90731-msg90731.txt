  
After putting together the 0.3.21 release candidate today, I'm thinking after
0.3.21 is out the door it might be a good time to do a major source tree re-
org. I like the idea of following the GNU directory layout standard, and it
would make my job easier if source was in src/, readmes/etc were in doc/,
scripts to automate the Windows build were in build/, etc.  
  
PS: jaromil is the second person I've heard who says they'd prefer a
development mailing list. I don't care one way or another, but it would be
easy to create one using SourceForge's mailing list feature. What do others
think?
