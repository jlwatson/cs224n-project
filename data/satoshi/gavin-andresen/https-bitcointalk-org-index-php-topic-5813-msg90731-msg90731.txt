I don't want to speak for any of the other dev team members, but I tend to
prioritize massive re-orgs like this below just about any other change. They
create a lot of noise, making sifting through history more difficult (even
though git helps with this). They break existing patches.  
  
And in the language-specific arena, the two-files-per-class (.h, .cpp) creates
an absolute explosion of tiny files, which is frankly a pain in the ass.  

  
After putting together the 0.3.21 release candidate today, I'm thinking after
0.3.21 is out the door it might be a good time to do a major source tree re-
org. I like the idea of following the GNU directory layout standard, and it
would make my job easier if source was in src/, readmes/etc were in doc/,
scripts to automate the Windows build were in build/, etc.  
  
PS: jaromil is the second person I've heard who says they'd prefer a
development mailing list. I don't care one way or another, but it would be
easy to create one using SourceForge's mailing list feature. What do others
think?
