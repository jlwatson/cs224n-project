All this talk about neato-spiffy future hub-and-spoke supernodes-and-leaves
architecture is great.  
  
But I was kinda thinking of first solving the problem that anybody who just
wants to download the client, get a few coins from a friend, and then spend
them on something has to wait a very long time right now. That doesn't require
any re-architecting of the system or any new networking messages, and should
make the "out of the box" bitcoin experience much better for lots of people.  
  
And it is a step towards a future neato-spiffy Uber-efficient hyper++client.
