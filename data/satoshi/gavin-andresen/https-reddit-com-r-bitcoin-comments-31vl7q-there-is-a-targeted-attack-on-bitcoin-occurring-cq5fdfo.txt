Okey dokey, but this smells very much like a conspiracy theory.

Especially the action item at the end: "spread the word."

If you had ended with "These are the concrete things we all should be doing" then I'd be more sympathetic... assuming those things weren't just "BE EXTRA PARANOID! THEY ARE OUT TO GET US!"
