  
No, that's not a realistic attack.  
  
For an attacker to feed you a malicious block chain, they would have to be
able to produce malicious blocks that have CORRECT proof-of-work. I don't
think it is realistic to think that any attacker would throw lots of hash
power onto a malicious block chain just so they can feed a bad block chain to
somebody who connects to them.  
  
Especially since that somebody would discover that their version of the block
chain was incorrect within about 10 minutes, as soon as they got a new block
message.  
  
The bugfix was a "belt and suspenders" change to limit the potential damage
from somebody who already had more than 50% of hashing power.
