RE: binding to any/all IPs: DANGER! Make sure you have good firewall rules for
port 8332 or you are likely to find yourself with an empty wallet! Bitcoin is
using HTTP BASIC authentication, so anybody who can eavesdrop on the
connection between your JSON-RPC client and the bitcoin server can see the
password (it is NOT encrypted).  

I was thinking about adding support for Digest auth...  

I wouldn't bother-- HTTP Digest auth is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
attacks, it'd be a lot of work for a probably false sense of security.
