RE: the 100/120 difference:  
  
Check my work, but I think this is the scenario where it would matter and
cause headaches:  
  
You generate a block 100 blocks before a difficulty adjustment.  
  
Then you spend the coinbase exactly 100 blocks later, in a block in the next
difficulty period. And, let's say, whoever you send the bitcoins to spends
that transaction again immediately.  
  
Now imagine a really wacky scenario where you're reorganized onto a shorter-
but-has-more-difficulty block chain. That could happen if you were
disconnected from the main bitcoin network for a while.  
  
Your coinbase-spend transaction and any transactions that depend on it can't
be included in the main chain because they're immature, so they get dropped
from everybody's memory pool as "trying to spend an immature coinbase." I'm
not sure what then happens; I think you'd eventually retransmit them and get
them into the main chain, but that could take a while.
