  
Entering a password every time you want to send coins (or pulling out your...
dongle... err, that didn't come out right, uhh, fetching your one-time-
password-generating-device) might be annoying enough that withdrawing 50 or
100 bitcoins that you can spend with minimal hassle would be a nice feature.
