Why? It's all the same thing, a group of private keys. If it needs to be more
secure, require a password, biometric access, whatever. There's no good reason
I can think of to distinguish between one keystore and another.  

  
Entering a password every time you want to send coins (or pulling out your...
dongle... err, that didn't come out right, uhh, fetching your one-time-
password-generating-device) might be annoying enough that withdrawing 50 or
100 bitcoins that you can spend with minimal hassle would be a nice feature.
