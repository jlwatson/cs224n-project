But bitcoind is 0.3.20.0 **0** and requires MSVC libraries.  

  
Did I put the wrong bitcoin **d**.exe in the Windows exe and/or zip?

Companies I've worked for in the past had a rule-- programmers were not
allowed to test their own code. I'm still looking for people to volunteer to
be dedicated quality assurance testers (and a quality assurance manager to
organize them) to help keep this type of thing from slipping through.
