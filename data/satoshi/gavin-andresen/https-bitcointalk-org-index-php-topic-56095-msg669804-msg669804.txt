Anyone interesting in creating and testing more unit tests together?  

  
Good Idea. How are you creating the files?  
  
What language are you writing in? Anybody want to volunteer to write a
Satoshi-bitcoin unit tester in C++ that parses ThePiachu's format? Or do you
already have code that runs them? Committing a gazillion Script unit test
cases to src/test/scriptTests/ sounds like a very good idea to me.
