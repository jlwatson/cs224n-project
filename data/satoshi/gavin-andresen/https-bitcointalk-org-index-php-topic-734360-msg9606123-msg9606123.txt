If you want to work on IBLT stuff...  
  
... start with Matt's fast-relay code:
https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/RelayNode  
  
That is an "I know what I've already told my peers, so I won't tell them
again" optimization for transaction data. I haven't tried to figure out how
far that already-written-and-running code lets us scale, but I think that
would be the first step.  
  
Once you understand what Matt is doing, then figure out how an IBLT can
further optimize to eliminate sending even lists of transaction IDs. The first
step there is to figure out what software miners are using to build their
blocks, and figuring out how hard it would be to get that software to do the
IBLT thing (have similar policies for selecting transactions, and identical
policies for ordering transactions inside the block).
