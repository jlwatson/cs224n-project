  
Yeah-- "democratic" is such a loaded word. Everybody loves democracy, so I
didn't want to bash it.  
  
But democracy can be terrible if you're in the minority and the majority
decides to trample on your rights.  
  
I probably should have just said "Bitcoin is a lot more democratic than the
system we currently have, where a handful of unelected central bankers control
our money."
