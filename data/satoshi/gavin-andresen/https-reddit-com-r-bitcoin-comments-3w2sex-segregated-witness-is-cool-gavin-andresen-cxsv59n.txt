I was aware it was running on the Alpha sidechain.

The trick of interpreting a PUSHDATA *stuff*  scriptPubKey as a segwitness-enabled transaction is the part I wasn't aware of before, and that is what gives the smooth upgrade path for wallets. And that's really cool.

(I'm not aware if elements alpha does that, but I'd guess it doesn't, since it's not necessary because segwitness is built in to that chain from the start)
