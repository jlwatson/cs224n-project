  
There's been exactly one block with non-standard transactions:  
http://blockexplorer.com/b/71036  
... and it contained no fees.  
  
HOWEVER: jgarzik, you're over-reacting, too. This will **not** cause a block
chain split; all clients will accept blocks containing non-standard
transactions as valid. Most (many?) just won't put non-standard transactions
in blocks that they generate, and won't relay them. There will be no havoc.
