I think we want bitcoin to be stable before all else, so if somebody wants to
use different chain or different network, perhaps simply a forked client
should be made for that.  

  
The test network (run bitcoin with the -testnet flag) is a different block
chain, implemented so that the two chains never get confused. If anybody wants
to start yet another block chain, it isn't technically hard, and won't cause
any problems for "real bitcoin".  
  
The hard part would be getting anybody to use your alternative; it would have
to be better in some way other than just "I started the new chain, so I've got
a lot of the easy-to-generate-at-the-beginning-coins."
