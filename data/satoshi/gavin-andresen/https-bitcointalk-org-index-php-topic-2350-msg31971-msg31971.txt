Because Bitcoin has tremendous value, it's OK to underpromise and overdeliver.
It always turns out better that way, in the long run.  
  
If you lie, you only need one prominent journalist to say "I tried it, and
it's crap, it doesn't do what they say it does", and the public loses
interest.  

  
Well said!  
  
Trust is Bitcoin's biggest barrier to success. I don't think there is anything
we can do to speed up the process of getting people to trust that bitcoin is
solid; it takes time to build trust. However, there is **plenty** we could do
to lose that trust, including overpromising or misrepresenting what bitcoin
can do.  
  
Bitcoin is beta software; nobody should trust it 100%. Do not invest your life
savings in bitcoin-- in fact, do not invest any money you're not willing to
lose. Expect more ponzi schemes and fraud. Expect irrational valuation
bubbles, and, while the bitcoin economy is small, expect people to try to
manipulate the bitcoin markets.
