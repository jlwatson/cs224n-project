  
Interesting idea!  
  
Thinking out loud... There Doesn't Have To Be One Way To Do It. Piuk (or
somebody) should hack together a client or miner that uses a ledger system; it
could refuse to relay or include any transactions with inputs smaller than
0.001 BTC, so it only needed a truncated ledger to create new blocks (if it is
a miner, maybe it connects to a trusted 'traditional' bitcoin node to make
sure it only builds on valid blocks which might contain tiny inputs).
