Update on the problem and release:  
  
m0mchil reports no rendering issues running a 0.3.20 bitcoin compiled using
the mingw toolchain, and has volunteered to document/setup the build
environment (in an Amazon EC2 virtual machine that I'll make public so it'll
be easier for anybody to get a working bitcoin windows build environment up
and running).  
  
And responding to alkor: Windows/Mac open source coders seem to be a lot rarer
than Linux... which is not surprising, I suppose.  
  
PS to genjix: Looking good! I'll try to find some time to give it a try (I
don't know Qt programming so I probably won't be able to help code, though).
