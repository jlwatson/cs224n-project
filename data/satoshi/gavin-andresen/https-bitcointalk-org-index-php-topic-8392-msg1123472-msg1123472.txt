Making transactions with non-DER-encoded (aka BER encoded) signatures non-
standard has been on my TODO list for over a year now, but has never been the
highest priority. That's the first step to making non-DER-encoded signatures
completely illegal.  
  
Note that if there is a core-dumping bug in OpenSSL's decoding code then it
needs to get fixed in OpenSSL. Writing a BER decoder just for Bitcoin is a bad
idea, it is much more likely our new code would have a crashing bug.
