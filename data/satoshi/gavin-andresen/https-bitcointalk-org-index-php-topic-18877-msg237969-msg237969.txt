Bitcoin's technology is unstoppable, like p2p filesharing has proven to be
unstoppable. But "the Bitcoin Project" could fail in a bunch of different
ways.  
  
If mainstream people think "Oh, bitcoin is that internet thing used by
criminals", that is bad for bitcoin. It might be bad enough to kill the
project (note that I said "the project", not "the technology").  
  
If bitcoin really does turn into an internet thing only used by criminals then
I'll personally consider it a failed experiment and will find something else
to do.
