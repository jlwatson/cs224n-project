Microsoft/authenticode assumes one trusted master key (I think? Can a binary
be signed by multiple keys?)  
  
That is contrary to the no-central-authority idea, and it would be nice to
avoid that.  
  
However, given that Apple and Microsoft are both going in the direction of
"thou shalt be a registered developer to distribute software for our OS" a
central signing process for at least the initial install seems inevitable.  
  
This is one of those "interact with existing systems that do not consider the
possibility of radically decentralized solutions" hurdles that the Foundation
can help jump; I expect the Foundation will soon be a registered Apple and
Microsoft developer, and downloads will be signed with certificates owned by
the Foundation.  
  
The alternative is downloads only geeks can use (because only geeks know how
to turn off cert checks) or binaries signed by me personally. And I don't want
to be a single point of failure; having an organization that will hopefully
outlive me is a better solution.  
  
The best solution would be multi-signed binaries and a decentralized web of
trust system, but we're not there yet.
