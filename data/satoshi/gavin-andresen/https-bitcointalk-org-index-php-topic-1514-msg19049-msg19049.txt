I wonder if we have already passed the point where a user-typed-in-arbitrary-
key can be both secure from brute-force attacks and convenient to use.  
  
If you make the key long enough to prevent brute-force try-every-possible-key
attacks then typing it in gets really painful.  
  
You can add proof-of-work, but attackers tend to have lots of CPU power (think
botnets) and lots of time, and if you make the proof-of-work take more than a
few seconds per attempt on a low-CPU device it gets really painful again.  
  
I'm thinking some variation of wallet-on-a-USB-stick might be a more
convenient and practical way of physically exchanging bitcoins.  
  
I wonder if Ebay would let you sell USB sticks pre-loaded with Bitcoin, a
snapshot of the block chain, and a "starter wallet" with X bitcoins in it...
