  
The only completely and utterly decentralized bitcoin-like system I can think
of would have every person using it write and run their own code.  
  
On computers that they built themselves.  
  
Communicating over a wireless mesh network where each node in the mesh was
controlled by a single person who wrote all the code and built all the
hardware....
