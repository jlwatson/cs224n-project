Not a dumb question at all. Yes, that is possible, but would require a change to the proof-of-work algorithm that requires EVERYBODY (miners, merchants, exchanges, end-users) to upgrade their software.

There are less disruptive ideas for fixing this (e.g. @GibbsSamplePlatter's lock-up-some-coin idea, or the proposal that pools pay winning shares more and ordinary shares less so withholding blocks is too expensive to be profitable).
