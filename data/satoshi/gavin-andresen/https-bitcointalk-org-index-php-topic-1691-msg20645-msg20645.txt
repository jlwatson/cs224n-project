  
First: I've reviewed Bitcoin's networking code looking specifically for
possible buffer overflow vulnerabilities, and found none. It is possible I
missed something; please help review the code and let me or Satoshi know if
you find anything suspicious.  
  
Second: I don't think splitting the wallet handling code into a separate
process will improve security at all. If there is code that can send the
nicely-compartmentalized wallet handling code a command "Send XYZ bitcoins to
address 1ABC...", and that code has a buffer overflow vulnerability in it,
then you are just as vulnerable as today.  
  
If your PC has been compromised, then you are in trouble; anything you do on
your machine may be intercepted by a bad guy. Log into your bank account
website-- the bad guy might hijack your session and transfer money out. Start
up bitcoin-- the bad guy might inject keyboard and mouse events to send coins
out.  
  
Even if Bitcoin implemented multi-factor authentication before allowing wallet
access ("scan your fingerprint and enter your password to send coins"), if
your PC is compromised a bad guy could arrange to modify the bitcoin address
that you say you want to send coins to, so you think you're authenticating a
payment to Wally's Discount Center but you really authenticate payment to
Doctor Evil's Empire.
