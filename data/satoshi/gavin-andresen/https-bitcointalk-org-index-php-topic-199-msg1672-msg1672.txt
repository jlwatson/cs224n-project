I just finished creating a clean Amazon EC2 debian 5.0 machine image with
everything I needed to compile bitcoind, and it compiled (using a variation of
Laszlo's makefile.unix) and is running fine (just finished downloading the
block chain). I'll let you know if it misbehaves.  
  
I had trouble compiling the gtk version, but I think that's because I did
something wrong compiling wxWidgets. I don't need no stinkin' graphics (and am
not a wxWidgets expert), so I'm not going to bother trying to fix that.
