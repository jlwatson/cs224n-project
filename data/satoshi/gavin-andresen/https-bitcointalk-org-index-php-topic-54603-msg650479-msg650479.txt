  
The current import patch needs work to be of practical use to web services--
it does a scan of the entire blockchain to find transactions to the newly
imported key (and keeps the wallet locked that entire time). For any
sweep/import solution to be useful for more than once-in-a-blue-moon use, an
index of pubkeys to transactions involving those keys should be kept.  
  
It seems to me the "sweep now, and re-sweep every once-in-a-while"
functionality would work nicely for web services. Can you describe a use case
that wouldn't work?
