Thanks Xavier!  
  
To everyone else: the Faucet is now giving out bit-nickels; it just went under
500 BTC. I've got just under 2,000 BTC left to refill it, but I think I'll
start letting it drain a nickel-at-a-time and keep it above zero for as long
as I can (refilling it to just under 500 if it gets near zero).
