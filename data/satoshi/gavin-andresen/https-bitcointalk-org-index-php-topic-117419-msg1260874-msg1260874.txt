  
Actually, there is a small incentive to forward transactions:  
  
If you mine a block that contains a lot of transactions that have never been
broadcast on the network, it will take your peers longer to verify that the
signatures in the block are valid.*  
  
So it takes your block longer to propagate through the network, which makes it
slightly more likely to lose a block race.

* A couple of releases ago I implemented a signature cache, so if a node sees a transaction broadcast it doesn't have to re-check it when that transaction is part of a block.
