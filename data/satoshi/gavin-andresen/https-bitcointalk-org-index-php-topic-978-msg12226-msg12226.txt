Unlike a public HTTPS web server, which accepts connections from anybody, the
bitcoin HTTPS JSON-RPC server will only accept connections from trusted
clients, and you'll almost certainly be your own root certificate authority--
there is no reason to pay for a Verisign certificate, you should generate your
own and deploy it with the code that is talking JSON-RPC to your server.  
  
Or, in other words, since you'll control both ends of the conversation (as
opposed to a web server, where you typically control EITHER the server OR the
web browser) you can make it completely secure.
