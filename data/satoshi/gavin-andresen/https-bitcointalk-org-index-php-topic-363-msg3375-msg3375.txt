I'm working on an alternate bitcoin client and I'd like to try it on the test
network. Is there a list of bootstrap hosts for the test network somewhere, so
I don't need to implement an IRC client at this point?  

The TEST Faucet will be running on host: li133-197.members.linode.com  
(starting tomorrow, if all goes as planned). You can connect to it to
bootstrap.
