Thanks for all the kind words!

The truth is I'm just not excited about doing the work necessary to lead a team that could compete with Core. I'm tired of working with people spread out all over the world, and am tired of the toxic, 'gotcha!' culture that has taken over bitcoin protocol development.

So I'm keeping myself busy working on small projects (like randomsanity.org) and spending time looking for interesting people and projects near home.
