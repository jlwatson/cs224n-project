So, one thought:  
  
Instead of "staging" all of the dependencies and then modifying the
makefile/.pro to look for the dependencies in six different places, it would
be cleaner to configure with --prefix=<somewhere> and then 'make install' to
put all the dependency libraries/include files in one spot. Ideally, none of
the makefiles/.pro files would contain specific version numbers for anything.  
  
Specific notes as I worked through doing that on a Windows system, putting
dependencies in C:\deps :  
  
Openssl: /bin/perl Configure --prefix=/c/deps mingw ...etc  
  
BDB: ../dist/configure --prefix=/c/deps ...etc  
  
Boost: b2.exe --layout=system --prefix=C:\deps link=static threading=multi
runtime-link=static toolset=gcc ...etc  
  
Qt: configure.exe -prefix=C:\deps -I "C:\deps\include" -L "C:\deps\lib" ...etc
