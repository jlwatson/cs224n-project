I've uploaded release candidate binaries for Bitcoin versions 0.4.1 and 0.5.0
to SourceForge:  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.4.1/test/  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.5.0/test/  
  
The 0.4.1 release is the old wxWidgets-based Bitcoin with a critical fix to
the wallet encryption feature.  
The 0.5 release is the new Qt-based Bitcoin (which also includes the wallet
encryption bugfix).
