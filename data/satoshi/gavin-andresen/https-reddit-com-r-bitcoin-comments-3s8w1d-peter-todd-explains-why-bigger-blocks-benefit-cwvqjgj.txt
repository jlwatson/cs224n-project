Sigh.

Do you agree that there would be ~no problem if everybody outside the GFW started doing what the miners inside the GFW are doing (SPV mining on top of block headers)?

If you agree with that, then the problem is SPV mining, NOT the size of blocks.

And the solution is to get blocks propagating as quickly as block headers (which Matt's relay network accomplishes, and which can be improved with even smarter block propagation techniques).
