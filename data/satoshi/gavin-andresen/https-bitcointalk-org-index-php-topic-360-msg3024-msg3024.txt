  
If I understand correctly, you've got two chances to find a collision instead
of one.  
  
So this decreases the security of SHA256 by a factor of 2... which is just Not
a Big Deal. Bitcoin is using, essentially SHA255 instead of SHA256. It'll
still take longer than forever to find a collision...
