I think including a message that is NOT stored in the blockchain but is just
broadcast across the network is a good idea. The receiver would only get the
message if they were online and saw the transaction broadcast, but I think
that would be fine (and perhaps services would spring up to deliver the extra
transaction data associated with old transactions).  
  
First, though, I think the transaction memory pool needs to be re-implemented,
and the transaction relaying rules need to be changed so that the entire size
of the transaction (not just the part that will be stored in the block chain)
is considered in the priority/fee calculations.  
  
And fixing the client so it calculates fees properly is higher priority...
