Thanks! I agree, I think we can learn a lot from BGP.

This incident is interesting: http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2014/08/13/bgp-routing-table-size-limit-blamed-for-tuesdays-website-outages/

... disruption caused by old hardware not being able to handle growth in a protocol that didn't set a limit... 

I assume the fix was to upgrade the hardware, and not impose an arbitrary limit? Any network engineers know what happened?
