  
That's not the ONLY question. A question I've been thinking a lot about is
what are an employer's potential liabilities if they are caught paying
employees in bitcoins "under the table."  
  
I honestly don't know the answer if the employer is in Finland and the
employee is in Ecuador, and suspect the answer might depend on whether or not
the person doing the work is considered an independent contractor or an
employee.
