Bad peer code that drops the connection and refuses reconnection seems like a
good denial-of-service prevention measure.  
  
My only hesitation is accidentally causing a network (and, therefore, block-
chain) split if "bad" turns out to be "my peer is running a newer version of
the protocol and is accidentally sending me messages I don't understand."  
  
RE: net neutrality: if you have to worry about your bitcoin traffic being shut
down, I think that problem is better solved with TOR or another network proxy
solution.
