I can't resist, the problem of how to bootstrap a new chain in the face of
massive, hostile hashing power fascinates me.  
  
CoinHunter, what will happen to SolidCoin if, God forbid, you get hit by a
bus? What are the plans for the trusted CPF wallets? Do your heirs get control
of them?  
  
And what if SolidCoin is wildly successful-- so successful that each SC is
worth 1,000 euros? Will somebody still need 1 million of them (so have to be a
euro billionaire) to be trusted?
