As you are writing this is expected behaviour, does this mean the transaction
will eventually get confirmed at some point (if so, how will it be funded?)?
Or do I have to do something in order to recover the coins?  

It will get confirmed; it is already 'funded' (you can never send more coins
than you have in total in your wallet).  
  
This example might help; if you have exactly two accounts in your bitcoin
wallet and their balances are:  
  
Account A: -0.1 BTC  
Account B: 1 BTC  
  
... then if you tried to send 1 btc from account B the send would fail with an
"insufficient funds" error.  
  
I'd suggest funding a 'TransactionFees' account, and then when a sendfrom
results in transaction fees reimburse the account by moving funds from
TransactionFees.
