  
That's non-trivial to implement; it seems to me that a conscious decision by
the miners/pools to support or not support is less work and safer.  
  
Luke proposed something similar earlier, though; I'm surprised his patches
don't implement it.  
  
I like whoever proposed that the string in the coinbase refer to the BIP, in
the future that's the way it should be done.  
  
  
RE: schedules:  
  
Deadlines, as we've just seen, have a way of focusing attention. OP_EVAL got,
essentially, zero review/testing (aside from my own) until a month before the
deadline.  
  
It seems to me one-to-two months is about the right amount of time to get
thorough review and testing of this type of backwards-compatible change.
Longer deadlines just mean people get busy working on other things and ignore
the issue.
