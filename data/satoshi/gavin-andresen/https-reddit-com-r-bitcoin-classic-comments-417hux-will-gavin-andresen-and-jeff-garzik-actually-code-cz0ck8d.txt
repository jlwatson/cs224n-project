Here is what I said to somebody else in a private message:

What I want to do for Classic: get development started on the right foot. Creating crappy or insecure releases or a crappy development culture will kill it.

I don't want to end up lead maintainer.

And... that's about it.  Start it out right, hope it gets humming, then get back to researching gossip network protocols (or whatever).
