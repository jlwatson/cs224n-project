So go implement it and see how well it works.  
  
Create a little HTTP-based protocol with, oh, three methods:  

  * You send a block height or block hash, you get back a ledger hash.
  * You send a ledger hash, you get back the full ledger or an "I have no idea what you're talking about, that's not a valid ledger hash".
  * You send two ledger hashes, you get back the changes from one to the other or an "I have no idea what you're talking about, one of those isn't a valid ledger hash".

  
Then you just need to convince a bunch of semi-trustworthy people to run
"ledger servers." And maybe have some mechanism for reporting when a ledger
server has a bug or 'goes rogue' and reports a ledger hash that is different
from everybody else.  
  
Oh, and you might need to solve the incentive problem of "why would I run a
ledger server if I'm not paid for it" (and maybe write a bunch of denial-of-
service-prevention code in case some jerk with a botnet decides to ask for
10,000 full ledgers from 10,000 different IP addresses).
