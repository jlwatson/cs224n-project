I hate to be a wet blanket, but if "they" wanted to stop this why couldn't
"they" simply pass a law stating that it was illegal to buy or sell bitcoins?  
  
Or "they" could impose a punitive tax on purchases or sales of bitcoins.  
  
I suppose my point is: if "they" **really** want to make bitcoin illegal, then
they will find a way to do it; I don't think creating bitcoin derivatives will
help much on the legal front.
