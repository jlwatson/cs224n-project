With Satoshi's blessing, and with great reluctance, I'm going to start doing
more active project management for bitcoin.  
  
Everybody please be patient with me; I've had a lot of project management
experience at startups, but this is the first open source project of any size
I've been involved with. Anyway, I've created an integration/staging tree at:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin  
  
... and am proposing this for a development process:  
  
Straw-man plan for Bitcoin development (open source vets, please slap me
around and help make this better):  
  
Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature is ready.  
  
Requests get discussed (where? here in the bitcoin forums?) and if there's
broad consensus they're a good thing, well written, match coding style, etc.
then they're merged into the 'master' branch.  
  
master branch is regularly built and tested (by who? need people willing to be
quality assurance testers), and periodically pushed to the subversion repo to
become the official, stable, released bitcoin.  
  
We'll create feature branches if/when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.  
  
Discussion, feedback, etc, **especially** from people with experience leading
or working on other open source projects, is very welcome.
