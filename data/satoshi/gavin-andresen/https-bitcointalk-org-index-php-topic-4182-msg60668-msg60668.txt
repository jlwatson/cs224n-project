MT.Gox's selling price is now at 81 cents... it was at 90 cents a few MINUTES
ago, at 92~94 cents 2 days ago...  
is this a trend that will continue?  

  
You mean fairly large fluctuations in BTC/$ prices? Yes, yes it will. If
you're looking for a stable, boring investment do not buy bitcoins.  
  
I'm still surprised we haven't seen a real price bubble yet (where my
definition of bubble is "doubles in price and then falls all the way back
down"). Maybe we're in the middle of one still on its way up...
