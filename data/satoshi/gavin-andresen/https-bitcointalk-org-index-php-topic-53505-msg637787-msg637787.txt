How:  
  
CNode::Misbehaving(int howmuch) is called when code detects that a peer is
doing something out-of-the-ordinary. In this case, if a peer sends you a block
that can't possibly be in the best chain, Misbehaving(100) is called.  
  
When a Node accumulates a misbehavior score greater than or equal to
"-banscore" (default 100), their connection is dropped and their IP address is
banned from reconnecting for "-bantime" seconds (default 24 hours).  
  
When are they un-banned:  
  
After -bantime seconds. But the list of banned IP addresses is stored in
memory, so if you shutdown and restart bitcoin everybody is un-banned.  
  
There is no way to see the list of currently banned nodes, but you will see
"Disconnected n.n.n.n for misbehavior" and "connection from n.n.n.n dropped
(banned)" in the debug.log.
