  
You can run the front-end on one server and the back-end on another (and
communicate via JSON-RPC over HTTPS). That's how I'm able to run the Faucet
and ClearCoin on Google's App Engine (they talk with bitcoind processes
running on linode.com and aws.amazon.com servers). bitcoind doesn't take much
memory, bandwidth, or CPU (just don't turn on coin generation), so, for now,
anyway, you can even use an Amazon "micro" server (which costs something like
$100 per year).  
  
I'm not selling anything so can't comment on the shopping cart interfaces.
Screen-scraping web pages is a bad idea for lots of reasons.
