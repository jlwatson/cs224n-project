I'm reposting from the ClearCoin news blog:  
http://clearcoin.blogspot.com/2011/06/charity-escrow-changes.html  
  
I've been contacted by a charity who is not happy that they were listed as a
donation option for ClearCoin charity escrows.  
  
I made the mistake of assuming that charities would appreciate the extra
bitcoins; it never occurred to me that ClearCoin customers might contact a
charity and ask THEM for their (supposedly-donated) coins back. Charities
can't be expected to resolve ClearCoin disputes.  
  
To fix the problem, I have disabled all charities for new escrow accounts
except one: the Bitcoin Faucet. I will be writing to any charities that
received ClearCoin donations from already-created escrow transactions to make
them aware of the situation and will ask them to forward any ClearCoin-related
issues to me.
