I think it should be enough to backup your wallet, delete your .bitcoin folder
in your user profile folder, create a new .bitcoin folder, put your wallet
inside and then start bitcoin. It should download a new copy of the block
chain and you should be good to go. AFAIR this is a known bug.  

  
Don't do that, you'll just spend a lot of time re-downloading the block chain
and then be back in the same state you were before (unless you happen to get
lucky and your transactions get confirmed while you're waiting for the block
chain to download again).  
  
Restarting bitcoin and letting it get 8 fresh connections might help. Allowing
incoming connections so you have more than 8 connections should also help your
transactions get confirmed.  
  
Safest thing to do is to be patient; your transactions will be rebroadcast and
eventually will get confirmed. If they're not confirmed in a week, then there
are ways of deleting the transactions from your wallet and "freeing up" the
stuck bitcoins, but messing with your wallet should always be a last resort.
