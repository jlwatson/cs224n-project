I think in a year or so after the current influx of investment starts producing results it will be safe to stop saying "Bitcoin is an experiment."

Block sizes are already dynamic-- miners decide how large to make the blocks. If you mean maximum block size: I haven't heard a dynamic proposal that fixes the problem that people are worried about.

No, there is no canary clause for Bitcoin.
