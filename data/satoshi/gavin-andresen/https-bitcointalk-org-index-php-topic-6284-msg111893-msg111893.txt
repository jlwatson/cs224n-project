  
Why? Thats years and years away. I don't think any of us can predict exactly
what is going to happen 10 or 15 or 20 years from now; I don't think it is
possible to get a consensus now because there has never been a system like
bitcoin before, so predicting how merchants, miners, and users will interact
in 10 years seems to me to be impossible.  
  
So: do you think this supposed problem will happen all at once? Or will it
happen slowly over time? If you think it will happen all at once, would there
be any warning signs? If it is a problem that we can clearly see coming, then
there will be time to react.  
  
I'm much more worried on the problems I see coming in the next year or two or
three-- bitcoin-specific viruses and trojans, poorly coded bitcoin web
services, and maybe bitcoin service operators getting charged with financial
crimes that they didn't know they were violating.
