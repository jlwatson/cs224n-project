Yes, he suggested transactions voting at the Satoshi Roundtable in Florida.

It makes sense to have the people using the network vote on improvements.

But... there are a whole 'nother set of 'hodlers' who almost never move their coins who might want to have a vote, too.

And then there are the miners who have sunk costs into equipment and power contracts and who will bear most of the burden of any change.

And startups who might not not be generating a lot of transactions but have sunk time and money and have a stake in Bitcoin's success.

All of these are 'stakeholders' that should have a voice (and ideally a vote, but I have no idea how to do that) in the technical direction of Bitcoin.
