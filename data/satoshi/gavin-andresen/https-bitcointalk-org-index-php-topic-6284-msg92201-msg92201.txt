Consider for now, we're in the future, and miners only gain from transaction
fees. I assume now that including a transaction is cheap, and generating a
block is, in comparison, expensive. (Is that true?)  

  
Today, it costs the entire network something like $0.001 to process each
transaction.  
  
The limiting factor is checking to see if the transaction is valid or not (the
CPU cost of ECDSA signature verification). When the transaction volume gets
high enough miners will have to start prioritizing which transactions they
check, and they will use transaction fees as a quick initial check to see if
they should invest CPU cycles to include transactions in a block. Yes, miners
want to include as many transactions with fees as possible in their blocks,
but it won't be economical for any miner or mining pool operator to include an
infinite number of them.  
  
And speaking of mining pools... they are a lot more efficient than individual
miners because they allow transactions to be verified once instead of
requiring that all of the miners in the pool do that work. Very small miners
will be driven to join a mining pool, and the big mining pools will be
competing to have the lowest fees and highest payouts (and so will be
optimizing their ECDSA verification code and will figure out which
transactions are profitable and which aren't).  
  
So: I don't think bitcoin will have very few miners. I think it will have lots
of miners connected to a smaller number of mining pools, and the whole system
will optimize itself to be wonderfully efficient.
