Transaction spam is not a high-priority issue, in my humble opinion, and I
don't think we need to do anything more right now.  
  
We were running into big free-transaction backlogs because of the rise in
popularity of the mining pools, but with the big pools now using the new
sendmany feature to pay (with a transaction fee) their users that issue has
gone away.  
  
The improved -limitfreerelay and sendmany will both be in the next release,
which should further improve the situation. And I think in the next few months
lightweight download-headers-only clients will start to appear.  
  
I would much rather see work on optimizing the network protocol so that hashed
of already-spent transactions deep in the block chain aren't sent to (or
stored on) new nodes joining the network.
