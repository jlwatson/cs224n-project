It seems to me having miners share 'near-miss' blocks with each other (and the
rest of the world) does several good things.  
  
As Greg say, that tells you how much hashing power is including your not-yet-
confirmed transaction, which should let merchants reason better about the risk
of their transactions being double-spent.  
  
If the protocol is well-designed, sharing near-miss blocks should also make
propagation of complete blocks almost instantaneous most of the time. All of
the data in the block (except the nonce and the coinbase) is likely to have
already been validated/propagated. See Greg's thoughts on efficient encoding
of blocks: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/User:Gmaxwell/block_network_coding  
  
So there could almost always be no advantage to working on a smaller block
rather than a larger block (it would be very rare to find a full-difficulty
block before finding-- say-- a 1/100'th difficulty block).  
  
Near-instant block propagation if you 'show your work' should give un-selfish
miners an advantage over miners who try any kind of block withholding attack.
And it should make network convergence quicker in the case of block races;
miners could estimate how much hashing power is working on each fork when
there are two competing forks on the network, and rational miners will abandon
what looks like a losing fork as soon as it looks statistically likely (based
on the previous-block pointers for near-miss blocks they see) that they're on
the losing fork.  
  
We can do all of this without a hard fork. It could even be prototyped as an
ultra-efficient "miner backbone network" separate from the existing p2p
network-- in fact, I'm thinking it SHOULD be done first as a separate
network...
