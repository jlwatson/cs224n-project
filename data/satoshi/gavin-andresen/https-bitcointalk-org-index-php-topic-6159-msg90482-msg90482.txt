I think the default client should show at least one additional digit by
default, and of course there should be the option to increase it arbitrarily.  

  
The 0.3.21 release (I hope to have a release candidate available today) will
support full-precision values-- you will be able to send 1.00123456 BTC, if
you like.  
  
Sending less than 0.01 BTC still requires a 0.01 BTC fee, though. Changing
that to "sending less than 0.01 BTC requires a 0.001 BTC fee" might be worth
thinking about, but I think there are higher priorities on the core bitcoin
TODO list.
