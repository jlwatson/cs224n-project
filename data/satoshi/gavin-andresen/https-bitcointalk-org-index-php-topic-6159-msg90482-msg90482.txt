  
The 0.3.21 release (I hope to have a release candidate available today) will
support full-precision values-- you will be able to send 1.00123456 BTC, if
you like.  
  
Sending less than 0.01 BTC still requires a 0.01 BTC fee, though. Changing
that to "sending less than 0.01 BTC requires a 0.001 BTC fee" might be worth
thinking about, but I think there are higher priorities on the core bitcoin
TODO list.
