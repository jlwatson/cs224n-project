Pure coincidence, but I had lunch today with a local developer who will be
putting up a building in downtown Amherst. They are planning on running fiber
to the building, because they want to build for the future and the people they
want to sell to (like me in a few years, when we downsize after my kids are in
college) want fast Internet.  
  
If I gaze into my crystal ball... I see nothing but more and more demand for
bandwidth.  
  
We've got streaming Netflix now, at "pretty good" quality. We'll want enough
bandwidth to stream retina-display-quality to every family member in the house
simultaneously.  
  
Then we'll want to stream HD 3D surround video to our Oculus Rift gizmos,
which is probably another order of magnitude in bandwidth. To every member of
the family, simultaneously. While our home security cameras stream to some
security center off-site that is storing it as potential evidence in case of
burglary or vandalism....  
  
Then... who knows? Every prediction of " _this_ will surely be enough
technology" has turned out to be wrong so far.
