Couple of things:  
  
First, I want to squash the "Satoshi mined a bunch of bitcoins on his own
before releasing the bitcoin chain" idea. He publicly announced bitcoin
version 0.1 six days after he generated the genesis block: January 9, 2009:  
http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html  
  
According to the block chain history, he generated about 10 blocks total
before the announcement. And we know that he didn't pre-generate blocks
because the genesis block contains a quote from the January 3rd Financial
Times newspaper.  
  
Second, I have no problem with alternative block chains, I just don't
personally like how this particular alternative block chain is being promoted
and developed and introduced. In particular, I think it is unfair to keep
hundreds of thousands of whatever-coins for yourself, and it is unwise to
think that a bitcoin variation that is "almost exactly like bitcoin, only
different because... well, just because" will ever have anything more than
speculative value.
