  
I really like your idea of scaling up difficulty based on the number of domain
operations in a block to prevent the key:value database from growing
arbitrarily big.  
  
It seems to me that should be enough to make domain operation pricing correct;
I don't see why there needs to be a block reward or fees, I assume the
registrars will charge whatever they need to charge to make a profit, and I
would strongly encourage you to avoid making the DNS system yet-another-
currency. I'd like to use dollars or euros or bitcoins (preferably bitcoins)
to pay for my domain names, please.  
  
I imagine a system something like:  
  
\+ I give some money to a registrar, and ask them to register/renew/transfer
'gavinandresen.dianna'  
  
\+ The registrar makes sure the register/renew/transfer operation is valid  
  
\+ The registrar bundles up a bunch of register/renew/transfer operations and
then asks/pays a Bitcoin miner to merge-mine that hash to securely timestamp
those changes  
  
\+ After they're timestamped, the registrar asks that all of those record
changes be inserted into a shared distributed hash table, providing the DIANNA
proof-of-work and the bitcoin block hash.  
  
\+ The nodes maintaining the shared DHT make sure the records have the right
DIANNA proof-of-work, that the bitcoin block is valid, and that the changes
aren't over-ridden by a later bitcoin block, and then update the records.
