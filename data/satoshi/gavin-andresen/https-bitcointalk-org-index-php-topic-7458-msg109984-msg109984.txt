If your 0.33 bitcoins came from one or two recent payments to you, then
waiting a day or three to let the inputs "mature" will let you send them
without a fee. The transaction priority fee rules are designed to discourage
people from sending lots of small bitcoin transactions in a short time.  
  
If your 0.33 bitcoins came from 20 or 30 penny-sized payments to you, then
you'll have to go to a lot of work to send them without a fee, because a 20-
or 30-input transaction will be too big to qualify to be free. The transaction
size fee rules are designed to discourage people from wasting everybody's disk
and network bandwidth by sending big transactions.  
  
If you did receive lots of tiny payments, you can try to bundle them up in
chunks-- you might be able to send three payments of 0.10 BTC without a fee
(because each of them would be smaller than the "too big to be free" size).  
  
But you should ask yourself: is it really worth your time? 0.01 BTC is less
than 5 US cents. If it takes you more than 20 seconds to send 2 or 3 payments
to avoid the 0.01BTC fee, then you're valuing your time at less than US
minimum wage.
