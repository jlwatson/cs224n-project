Thanks to midnightmagic who directed me to this very helpful video about
identifying and then dealing with "poisonous people" in open source software
projects:

Watch the whole thing for examples of "poisonous person" behavior, like
repeatedly flooding mailing lists/forums with their opinion or comments, not
listening to the opinion of others, or making sweeping "the world will end
if..." statements about the project.  
  
I'll be blunt: I think Luke Dashjr fits the definition of a poisonous person,
and I think Bitcoin would be better without him. At the very least, we
wouldn't be creating two BIPs for every technical issue, one for Luke and one
for the rest of us (see BIP 16/17, and now we have BIP 20/21, too).
