No, I don't see how large miners can "cheaply" fill excess space in order to get an edge over small miners, NONE of the simulations that have been done show that. Please point me to one that does (Pieter's doesn't count, he was simulating a miner that was bandwidth-constrained. My simulation showed a very small effect with 20MB blocks IF the small miners are stupid and are somehow convinced to also produce 20MB blocks, but that effect goes away if the small miners produce small, quick-to-propagate blocks).

I DO see how a more-than-30%-hashrate miner could try the selfish mining attack... but as Mike points out in another comment here, miners aren't generally malicious AND these "how many miners can dance on the head of a pin" theoretical attacks backfire if more than one miner attempts them at the same time.
