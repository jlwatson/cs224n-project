Can you say something like "this transaction becomes void at block X" so if
it's not put in a block before then it becomes useless?  

  
I give you a transaction that sends you 11 bitcoins... but I tell you "you
better put that in the blockchain in the next 120 blocks, or I'll broadcast
another transaction that sends the inputs somewhere else so the transaction to
you will be seen as a double-spend."  
  
I'd need a bitcoin client that let me do that, and you'd need one that could
take a transaction in some format and then let you decide whether or not to
broadcast it for inclusion in the block chain, or told you "sorry, too late,
inputs already spent", but that all should work today.
