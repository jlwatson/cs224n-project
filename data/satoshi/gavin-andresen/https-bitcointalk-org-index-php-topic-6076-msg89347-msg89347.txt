It might make more sense to allow non-sensitive RPC commands to function
without a password. Where "non-sensitive" would be getblockcount/getdifficulty
maybe getnewaddress/getaccountaddress and a new 'you clicked on a bitcoin: URI
so popup a payment confirmation dialog'.  
  
"Making it easier for other applications to integrate with bitcoin" is bad if
the other applications are trying to steal your wallet, so I'm reluctant to
have bitcoin do things like create passwords for users.
