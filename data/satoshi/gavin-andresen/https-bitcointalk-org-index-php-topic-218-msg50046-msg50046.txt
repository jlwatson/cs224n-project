  
No, but there should be.  
  
Proposal: treat immature coins as starting with -100 confirmations, and modify
listtransactions to list immature category=generate coins (with negative
confirmations).  
  
There's probably an off-by-one-error lurking there... (will have to make sure
the coinbase transaction is spend-able when it goes from -1 to 0
confirmations).
