The new QT GUI (in git HEAD) has a nifty block-chain-download-progress
indicator.  
  
I'd like to pull together a version 0.5 release candidate and start testing it
early next week.  
  
Maybe the big feature for version 0.6 can be fast initial download (I'm
thinking the best thing to do for brand-new, starting-with-an-empty-wallet
installations is to download only block headers, function as a 'lightweight'
client, and 'backfill' full blocks until you're caught up with the full
chain-- then function as a 'full' client).
