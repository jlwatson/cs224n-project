Is my understanding correct that using the "payment protocol" will give away
my IP address to the merchant?  

  
No, not if you use Tor.  
  
Tor (or i2p or some other anonymizing proxy solution) is the only way to keep
online merchants from figuring out your IP. After all, if you browse to their
website without Tor, then your IP is sitting right there in their web server
logs.
