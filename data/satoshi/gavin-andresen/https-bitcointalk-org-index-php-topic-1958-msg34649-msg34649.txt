This was an extremely good interview. I didn't really entirely get how bitcoin
really works until now after reading this interview.  

Thanks! It was the first interview I've ever done via IM/chat, and it worked
well. I was surprised to see how little editing/reworking was done; I guess
they were happy with what I wrote, too.

Gavin, you mention that you use VPSes for your bitcoin apps. May I ask which
VPS providers you use? I am currently looking for VPSes for my own bitcoin
apps.  

  
Sure. I run two instances of bitcoind on a "Linode 512" running Debian (sign
up using this URL and I'll get a $20 credit). They're used for the TEST and
regular Bitcoin Faucets.  
  
I also use that system to compile bitcoin/bitcoind. I've been very happy with
Linode.  
  
The bitcoind for ClearCoin is running on an Amazon EC2 "micro" VPS instance,
also running Debian, using an encrypted EBS filesystem. I'm extra paranoid
about security and reliability for ClearCoin because I'm handling other
people's money.
