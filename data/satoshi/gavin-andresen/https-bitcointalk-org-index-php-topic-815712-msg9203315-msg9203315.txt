bottlenecks) are all growing exponentially right now, and are projected to
continue growing exponentially for the next couple decades.  
  
Why would we choose linear growth when the trend is exponential growth?  
  
Unless you think we should artificially limit Bitcoin itself to linear growth
for some reason. Exponential growth in number of users and usage is what we
want, yes?
