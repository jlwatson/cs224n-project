No, by itself segwit does not 'optimize' transactions; it just hides part of the transaction data from old, un-upgraded full nodes so it doesn't count towards the 1mb limit.

That hiding costs ... uhhh... about twenty extra bytes per transaction sent over the network versus the smallest possible old-style transaction (but about the same number of over-the-wire bytes as the Bitcoin-address transactions wallets create today).

There are transaction size optimizations being talked about, but they aren't part of segwit (or, at least, aren't being proposed as part of segwit yet-- they would add more code and need a LOT of review and testing).
