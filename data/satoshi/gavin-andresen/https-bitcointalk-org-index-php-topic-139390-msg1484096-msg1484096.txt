Humans are pretty bad at being original. REALLY bad at being random. And we
are terrible at comprehending huge numbers.  
  
So if you ask the average person to create a secure passphrase, they're very
likely to create something that a "determined attacker" with a lot of
computing power can crack.  
  
I think if people start to use quotes from obscure literary works as their
brain wallets, then they're going to lose their bitcoins sooner or later.
Attackers can try MILLIONS of passphrases per minute, to crack EVERY SINGLE
brainwallet that has ever been created.  
  
So: if you absolutely, positively won't be dissuaded from using a brainwallet,
here is my advice on how you _might_ be able to come up with a secure
passphrase:  
  
Think of two passphrases that you think you can remember. And think of a
government-issued number that you can easily lookup or remember (like your
driving license or social security number).  
  
Create a brainwallet passphrase that is:  
  
the first passphrase,the government id number,the second passphrase  
  
Then create a 'sentinel' brainwallet that is just the first passphrase, and
send a small number of bitcoins to it. When those bitcoins get spent (or more
bitcoins are sent to it by somebody else), you know that the first passphrase
you chose isn't good enough any more. Choose a more complicated passphrase and
create a new 'sentinel' and real brainwallet, and move your old brainwallet
there.
