Sounds like a challenge. If somebody can get sanity-checking of 8MB blocks running in less than 40ms, would you support raising the cap?

(is the merkle-building code parallelized? Building binary trees should be a nicely parallelizable process and multicore is a standard feature of modern CPUs...)
