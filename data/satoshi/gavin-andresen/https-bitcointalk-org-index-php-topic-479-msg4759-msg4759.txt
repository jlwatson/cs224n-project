chroot: won't protect you.  
  
Running as a separate VM: I think will protect you. But I thought browsers
wouldn't allow XMLHTTPRequests to "localhost" from web pages fetched from the
web, so my advice would be to test it. See if you can talk to the Bitcoin
daemon from another VM on the same machine by running "bitcoind getinfo" or
"bitcoin getinfo" on the non-bitcoin-vm.
