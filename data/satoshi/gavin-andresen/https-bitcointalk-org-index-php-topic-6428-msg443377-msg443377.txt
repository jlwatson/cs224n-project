Everybody likes this feature, and it feels like it is very close to being
ready for inclusion.  
  
There are two reasonable requests in this thread that I think should be
implemented before this is pulled:  
  
1\. Pieter's change to the API, so the <pubkey> is extracted/verified from  
verifymessage <bitcoinaddress> <signature> <message>  
  
2\. ByteCoin's request that the <signature> be industry-standard-
base64-encoded instead of hex or base58 encoded.  
  
  
The nonce/no-nonce argument seems like "angels dancing on the head of a pin"
to me; seems to me the tiny iota of theoretical added security (...sometime in
the future maybe when SHA256 is broken or partly broken...) isn't worth the
extra complexity.
