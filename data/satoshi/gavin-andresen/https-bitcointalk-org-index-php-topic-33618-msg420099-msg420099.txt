blk0001.dat stores all of the transaction data for the block chain.  
  
So to "inject" data into it you transmit valid transactions that are then
included in blocks. Dan crafted transactions that contain the tribute message.  
  
I think it is a neat hack. ("hack" in the sense of "clever, non-obvious way to
use technology") I wonder how much it cost in transaction fees, or if he
managed to do it entirely with free transactions...
