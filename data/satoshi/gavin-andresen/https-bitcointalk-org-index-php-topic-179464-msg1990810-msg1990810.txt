... In any given distro, there are thousands of packages, so thousands of
upstream projects, and tens to hundreds of package maintainers.  
  
Shouldn't we be worried about this?  

  
Sure. That's one of the reasons why I'm reluctant to upgrade the
distro/dependencies for the deterministic build process, and generally prefer
to use older dependencies rather than the "latest and greatest" of everything.
But there's a tradeoff between "risk that an Evil Maintainer slipped something
in" and "risk that we ship with an upatched bug" -- e.g. we tend to be on the
latest version of OpenSSL, but a few releases behind of Qt4.  
  
PS: if you really want to be completely paranoid, you should only run bitcoin
on old hardware/OS manufactured before 2009 so you can be sure the
hardware/firmware/OS doesn't have any wallet-stealing circuits/code
lurking....
