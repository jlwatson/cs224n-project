That is an Underpants Gnomes attack:

1. Majority of miners produce a 100+ block long chain with bogus million-dollar output.
2. Miners send million dollar transaction to unsuspecting Classic mode who happens to be catching up with chain.
3. ?????
4. Profit!!!
 
If I recall correctly, every node on the network starts warning something fishy is going on at step 2 ('invalid more work chain detected')....,
