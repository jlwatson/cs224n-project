  
I was thinking of a kind of replay attack:  
  
\+ Control the TPM's view of the world (e.g. make it seem like it is Jan 1,
2010)  
\+ Get the TPM to sign a small transaction, shut it down.  
\+ Increment time, get it to sign another transaction  
\+ Repeat.  
  
Replace "time" with "blockchain" and you've got the same problem: can the TPM
know that it's view of the external world is correct? If it sends a nonce (to
prevent replay attacks) to some external service that adds a timestamp and
signs it with a public key known to the TPM code... then we're back to using
two different servers.
