Good news: I'm just about to get a Bitcoin-Qt version 0.5 Release Candidate 1
out, with a much-improved GUI.  
  
Bad news: all the translations for the old wxWidgets Bitcoin are obsolete, and
the process for making translations is different.  
  
Is anybody willing to write new translations? Here's what you'll need to know:  
  

  * Three translations already exist: de nl and ru.
  * Translations are stored in ".ts" files in the src/qt/locale folder
  * The 'QT Linguist' tool can be used to create translations
  * ... or maybe an online tool like Transifex could/should be used to crowd-source the work

  
And is anybody willing to take the job of coordinating translation efforts,
figuring out if Transifex is a good tool to use, and writing some
documentation to make it easy for people to create and submit new
translations?
