  
I can't see how OP_CODESEPARATOR can be used, either. I'm tempted to suggest
that any transactions using it be 'discouraged' (have miners refuse to build
on blocks that contain transactions using it).  
  
Transaction hashes might be another, separate discussion topic-- I've been
thinking that the way transaction hashes are calculated/used could be
improved, although I don't think it is a critical design flaw but in the
category of "stuff we can live with but that maybe could have been done
better".
