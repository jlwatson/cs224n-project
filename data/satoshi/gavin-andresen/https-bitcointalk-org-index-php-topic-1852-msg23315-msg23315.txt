  
I worry that the correct analogy is:  
  
Typing a password every time you use your bitcoin wallet is like putting
padding your car's steering wheel instead of wearing a seatbelt. It might make
you feel safer, but it is a false sense of security.  
  
Good security **is** hard. If you're not computer savvy, then you've probably
already got spyware and trojans on your system, and running bitcoin on a
system infested with spyware and trojans is a bad idea. Period.  
  
I think an online service that takes care of wallet security for you is a much
better solution for non-geeks like my mom.  
  
All that said: As my personal bitcoin wallet gets more valuable, I get more
nervous. I would like to be able to export some of the value in my wallet onto
a USB thumb drive and then put that thumb drive in my safe deposit box (along
with a backup, gpg-encrypted copy that I'd keep in the fire safe in my
basement).  
  
Another analogy: I keep most of my money in the bank; I don't have piles of
cash or gold in my house. I will do the same for my bitcoins, keeping only
enough in my online, connected, possible-to-hack wallet to use day-to-day.
