After first time run db seems to have changed and no longer work with the old
(0.3.19) version. This is as planned?  

  
You must have compiled against a newer version of Berkeley DB, and it uses a
new log file format. Try removing the ~/.bitcoin/log.* files before running
the older bitcoin version.  
  
I changed build-unix.txt as you suggested.
