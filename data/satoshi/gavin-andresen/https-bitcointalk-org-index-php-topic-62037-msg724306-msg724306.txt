gavin, what they talk about in the video is one person derailing a whole
project over extended periods of time.

  
Yes, exactly. At some point you have to say "enough is enough, I'm not going
to let this person derail the project any more going forward."  
  
I'm saying that point is right now; see the unproductive, one-sided argument
about BIP 20 versus BIP 21 on the bitcoin-development mailing list that is re-
hashing a wiki editing war that "the rest of us" just gave up on a year ago
for the latest example.
