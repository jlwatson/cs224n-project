  
Yes, exactly. At some point you have to say "enough is enough, I'm not going
to let this person derail the project any more going forward."  
  
I'm saying that point is right now; see the unproductive, one-sided argument
about BIP 20 versus BIP 21 on the bitcoin-development mailing list that is re-
hashing a wiki editing war that "the rest of us" just gave up on a year ago
for the latest example.
