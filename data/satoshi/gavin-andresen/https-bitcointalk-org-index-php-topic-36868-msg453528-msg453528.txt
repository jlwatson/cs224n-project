  
Really? You do realize that will just start an arms race with maxmint; he or
she will write code to detect and ban bots, somebody will deploy bots via
multiple IP addresses to workaround, maxmint will be forced to add a CAPTCHA,
etc...  
  
maxmint: it can be kind of fun to try to scam the scammers. If you detect
them, just never let them win (but don't tell them you're not letting them
win).  
  
However, they'll eventually figure out you're doing that. The only way to win
the arms race is to make it more expensive for the scammers to win than the
reward. If I recall correctly, getting around one-per-IP-address and CAPTCHA
restrictions costs a scammer a few US pennies. If you're giving away 1BTC
worth $10, then you'll have to make sure the scammers will have to solve
several thousand captchas to win.
