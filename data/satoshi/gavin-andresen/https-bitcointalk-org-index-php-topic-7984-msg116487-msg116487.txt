  
Because that requires that you do some math to figure out how many to send to
pay the escrow plus release the right amount.  
  
And because I'm planning on eventually implementing "receiver creates and
pays" escrow transactions, so merchants can setup escrow transactions (via the
API) for their customers. Merchants are used to paying fees as just a cost of
doing business.  
  
RE: how will I prevent you from creating new escrow transactions if you don't
pay? Click on "Create Escrow" and you'll be taken to a page that politely
explains you're not allowed until you pay. If you use the API, the
create_escrow call will fail.  
  
I realize some people may try to cheat by using/creating multiple Google
accounts. That will be a cost of doing business for me. Perhaps I will reserve
the right to publish deadbeat account email addresses on a "hall of shame..."
(I'd implement a Terms of Service Agreement to which you would have to agree
before creating a new escrow)  
  
RE: will this affect coins in existing escrow accounts:  
  
No, existing escrow accounts will be unaffected, these new rules will be for
new escrow accounts only.
