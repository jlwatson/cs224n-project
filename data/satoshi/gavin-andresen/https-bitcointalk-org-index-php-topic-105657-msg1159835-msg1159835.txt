I'd like bitcointalk. **org** to be in the spirit of the Internet's original
".org" -- For Non-Commercial Use Only.  
  
But... it is hard to figure out what is Commercial Use and what isn't (e.g.
some mining pools are non-profit, some for-profit, and I'm sure there are some
in the fuzzy middle), which is why there really aren't any rules for .org any
more.
