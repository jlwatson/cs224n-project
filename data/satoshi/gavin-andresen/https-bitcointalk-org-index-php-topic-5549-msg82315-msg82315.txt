What about an infinitesimal, but non-zero transaction fee on all transactions?  
  
Is anyone but the spammers going to notice that they just got 0.00000001
clipped off their transaction?  

  
The problem with that idea is if the transaction fee is that low spammers
won't notice it either. They can just invest 0.01 BTC and send millions of
"non-free" transactions.
