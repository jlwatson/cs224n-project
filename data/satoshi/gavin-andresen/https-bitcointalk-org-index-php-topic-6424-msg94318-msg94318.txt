Code:

openssl enc -aes256 -in /dev/shm/wallet.dat -out $dir/wallet.dat.aes256 -pass
pass:$passw  
rm -f $dir/wallet.dat  

  
That really aught to be openssl .. && rm -f ...  
... or maybe something more complicated to make sure the wallet
encryption/writing completed OK before removing the wallet.dat. Like checking
to make sure wallet.dat.aes256's filesize doesn't get smaller through the
decrypt...use...re-encrypt cycle.
