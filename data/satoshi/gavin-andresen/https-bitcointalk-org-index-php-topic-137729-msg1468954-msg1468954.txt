  
But a transaction with a 0.005 BTC output triggers this rule:  

Code:

// To limit dust spam, require MIN_TX_FEE/MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE if any output is
less than 0.01

  
... so you're back to paying 10kilobytes * 0.0005 BTC / kilobyte == 0.005 BTC
to spend those 0.005 BTC.  
  
Yes, if you have a large-value, well-aged input then you can combine it with
tiny transactions, have a single output greater than 0.01 BTC, and probably
get into a block for free.  
  
If you want to prototype a smarter coin-selection algorithm, you might start
with the 'spendfrom.py' code I wrote as an example of using the raw
transactions API:
