I saw a version of this at a presentation of a local "time dollars" group...
and I think their arguments go wrong at a couple of places.  
  
First, wealth creation is limitless (we continue inventing more efficient ways
of doing things and new things to spend our time and money on), so it's simply
not true that an ever-increasing money supply (created via debt) is
unsustainable. If there was some way of pegging the creation of the 'right'
amount of money to the overall amount of wealth being created, then we'd get
stable prices and the 'right' level of investment.  
  
And second, the argument is that the system is stacked against the borrower--
that it is designed so that there's never enough money for everybody to pay
off their debts. So if I WANT to pay back my debt, I'll find out there's a
money shortage, and I won't be able to.  
  
That ignores the fact that I can walk away from my debts via bankruptcy. And
the fact that many loans are secured with some form of collateral, which
lenders accept in lieu of cash. Borrowing/lending is not an entirely closed
system, and, ideally, lenders have to be smart and fund borrowers who are
creating real wealth.
