It is possible to generate transactions that "fan out" to an arbitrary number
of recipients.  
  
They're non-standard transactions right now, so they won't be relayed or
included in blocks. But you should probably assume that they will be possible
in the future (and a miner could, of course, include them in their own blocks
now).
