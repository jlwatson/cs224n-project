you are putting words into mouth.

I agree the min wage is a redistribution device, I am just not convinced it is a very good one. If it mostly redistributes from the lower middle class to teenagers working part time who have wealthy parents then it is a really bad redistributive device.

If it mostly redistributes from the rich to the poor then cool. 

So educate me: any convincing studies on which it is?
