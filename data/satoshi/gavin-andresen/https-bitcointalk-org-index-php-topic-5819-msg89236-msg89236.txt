Thanks for the suggestions and comments, everybody; I think a combination of
dropping the faucet reward again (I'll start bundling up faucet payments into
'sendmany' transactions, so the transaction fees are lower) and "community
watch program" will work.  
  
The 'community watch' will be a web page that anybody can see that shows the
last 100 IP addresses that got payments along with an obfuscated version of
the email address (I'll obfuscate by randomly turning an email address like
'gavinandresen@gmail.com' into 'gavniadresen23@gmail.com'). And I'll recruit
some trusted people and give them access to a master faucet shut-off switch if
it starts getting abused again.
