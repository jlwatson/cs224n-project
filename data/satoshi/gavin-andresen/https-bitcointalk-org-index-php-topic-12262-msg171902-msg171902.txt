If I worked at AMD, I'd suggest that.  
  
I started my professional career at SGI, writing 3D graphics demos and
benchmarks, some of which were used to "burn in" the new hardware. Running a
bitcoin miner along with a couple graphics demos (to exercise all the graphics
hardware) might be a good way for ATI to make money on their burn-in process.
