I don't know nuthin about error-detecting checksums, but I think the time it
would take to implement it and argue about it would be better spent on more
user-friendly, secure ways of making bitcoin payments. I haven't heard of even
a single case of "I manually typed in a bitcoin address and the coins got lost
because I made an undetected transposition error."
