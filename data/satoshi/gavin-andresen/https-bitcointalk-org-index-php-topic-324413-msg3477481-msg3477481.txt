other miners as possible (to reduce orphan costs).  
  
RE: Evaluating sybil resistance: I would still like to see blocks and
transactions being broadcast over another completely different networking
protocol, either peer-to-peer or not. More diversity so we're not relying on
the one p2p network would be great, and, depending on how it was implemented,
might automatically bring sybil resistance.
