  
Yes. Old solo mining clients will produce perfectly valid blocks, unless
they've been hacked to mine "non-standard" transactions.  
  
There is a small risk that somebody ELSE will produce an invalid block, old
solo mining clients will think it is valid, and will try to mine on top of it.
But that's a small risk because we'll wait until a super-majority of the
network supports p2sh before starting to reject any p2sh transactions.  
  
So worst case scenario would be:  
  
\+ Somebody with a hacked bitcoind mines a block containing a valid-under-old-
rules, invalid-under-new p2sh transaction.  
\+ Old miners try to build on it, but the majority of the network rejects it
(there's a short block-chain split).  
  
If an attacker could target just the p2sh-supporting nodes and denial-of-
service enough of them to get p2sh support below 50%, then there could be a
longer block-chain split. If you do the math, that's not as easy as it sounds
(if p2sh support is at 80%, you'd have to knock out 60% of the supporting
nodes-- 20% of the original network would support, 20% wouldn't...).  
  
  
Don't do that, please. "Voting" with your coinbase should mean you actually do
the extra validation required by p2sh, otherwise you're saying you support a
feature when you really don't.
