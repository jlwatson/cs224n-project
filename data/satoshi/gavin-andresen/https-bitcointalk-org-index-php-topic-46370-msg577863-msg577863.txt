Nice work!  
  
That's almost exactly the direction I'm heading with the cross-platform
testing framework I've been working on, although I was planning on storing
blocks in JSON format and was planning on using Python's Twisted/Trial
framework to feed the different chains to the implementations to see if they
accept or reject them.  
  
I got sidetracked by the 0.5 release and then sidetracked again because I
couldn't resist experimenting with the "OP_EVAL" idea and multisignature
bitcoin addresses...
