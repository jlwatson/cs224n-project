Huh? That's backwards, transaction fees are smaller (as a percentage) if
you're sending more BTC. Number of bitcoins being sent doesn't matter, number
of inputs and outputs to the transaction matters.  
  
RE: estimating fees beforehand: what is the use case where that is actually
useful? What do you want the user experience to be?  
And what happens if the estimate turns out to be wrong?
