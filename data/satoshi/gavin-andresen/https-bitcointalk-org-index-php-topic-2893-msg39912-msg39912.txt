I think you should begin by defining the threat model.  
  
Can the attacker see all unencrypted IP traffic to/from the sender's node, or
is the traffic tunneled through an anonymizing network like i2p or tor?  
  
Does the attacker know any of the sender's receiving bitcoin addresses? Is the
attacker willing and/or able to send 'marked bitcoins' to the sender? Lots of
them?
