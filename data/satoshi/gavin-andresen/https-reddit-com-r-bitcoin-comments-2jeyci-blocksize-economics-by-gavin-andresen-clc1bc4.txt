I don't see how that changes the analysis in the blog post, which is making two major claims:

1. Transaction fees would not drop to zero, no matter the block size.
2. Block size has little to do with whether or not the future 0-subsidy Bitcoin will have enough fees to secure the chain.

Assuming that people don't work around the 10 minute artificial limit (I think they will, there are at least two approaches that should work, but lets assume they won't): that means less demand for transactions, which, indeed, should mean lower fees.

Again, I don't think that changes the analysis at all, it just adds yet another influence on the demand for Bitcoin transactions.
