I see what you mean now. Sending hashes for the target block that are a low
difficulty. Well that could work, but I see 2 issues immediately. The first is
that these hashes may or may not be produced in a regular manner, and there is
not even a guarantee a client would produce one. The calculated hash rate
based on this metric would have to be taken from a large sample size. The
second issue is that each miner would now need to check the calculated hash
against the target after every hash. This is another operation the client must
perform and it will slow down generation.  

  
I bet you'd get a good approximation of hash rate if clients submitted their
best (highest difficulty) hash every N minutes. Over a period of a few hours
the average of all of those best hashes should be proportional to the client's
hash rate (unless a client were somehow repeatedly very lucky or unlucky, but
that would be extremely unlikely).
