No, that will be fixed in the 0.8 release.  
  
If you think the single-send-not-randomizing-the-change-address-bug gives you
significantly less privacy... well, you're probably wrong, it is easy to
cluster addresses if you have the right network analysis tools. But you can
workaround the bug by adding an extra output to all of your transactions (add
a new receiving address and then click the 'add recipient' button in on the
Send Coins tab in Bitcoin-Qt and send some coins to yourself).
