Ebay specifically prohibits the sale of currency. I know, because I tried to
sell 10 as an experiment, some dick flagged my listing, and eBay sent me a
message with clear threats of shutting down my account if I ever list one
again.  
  
Anyone know a way around this?  

I still think selling boot-able USB sticks that contain a Linux distro,
bitcoin, a bitcoin miner, and "starter" bitcoins would be a great eBay
business/product. You're not selling currency, you're selling software and a
USB stick.  
  
You'll have to have a good eBay rep, though, because the person who gets it
would have to trust that you didn't keep a copy of the wallet.
