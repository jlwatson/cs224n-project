FYI:  
  
The Bitcoin Faucet bitcoind's are both running on a Linode VPS, which was
mysteriously restarted 14 hours ago. The 5 bitcoins in the main-net Faucet's
wallet were stolen, also; I'll shutdown the Faucet website, do NOT donate any
coins to the Faucet donation address, it is controlled by the thief.

... if you want to start watching where the coins end up.
