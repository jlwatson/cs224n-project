The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has determined that Amherst is
at "High" risk of mosquito-borne illnesses, and recommends that we all stay
inside at dusk.

  

Yeah... but I like going outside at dusk.

  

The incentives for the Health Department are to exaggerate the risks, because
when somebody gets Eastern Equine Encephalitis and dies they can (correctly)
point to their High Risk Warning and say "not our fault, we told you so."

  

But maybe the risk really **is** high, and we ought to slather ourselves with
DEET before walking downtown for dessert.

  

I wish there was a standard, easy-to-understand unit of risk, so the Heath
Department could say something like "We estimate spending an evening in
downtown Amherst with no mosquito repellant is 4-10 RUs (risk units)."

  

Where 1 risk unit is something we can all understand-- maybe "the risk
associated with driving 100 miles on the highway."

  

Or "1 risk unit is the overall risk of dying in an accident in any given
year."

  

I don't know what the right baseline would be; it doesn't really matter what
is chosen, what matters is making it easy to compare the risks of things
relative to each other.  The Health Department says we're at High risk... but
High compared to what?
