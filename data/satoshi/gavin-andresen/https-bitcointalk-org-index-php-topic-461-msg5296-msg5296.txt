I've updated the RPC wiki page for how the password stuff will work in Bitcoin
0.3.3.  
  
One nice side effect: you can prepare for the changes now; create a
bitcoin.conf file with a username and password and modify your JSON-RPC code
to do the HTTP Basic Authentication thing. Old code will just ignore the .conf
file and the Authorization: HTTP header.  
  
Question for everybody: should I add a section to the wiki page describing, in
detail, how to do HTTP Basic authentication? PHP and Python make is really
easy-- just use the http://user:pass@host:port/ URL syntax. I don't want to
just duplicate the HTTP Basic authentication Wikipedia page.
