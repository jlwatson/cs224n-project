It seems reasonable to me to start with UPnP disabled by default. As long as
enabling it in the client is easy enough to do, the network will benefit
because some nodes will "opt-in" that wouldn't have before. We can change the
default later, after we gain more confidence about remote vulnerabilities.  

  
Who knows enough about wxWidgets to add a checkbox to the Settings UI for
"Enable UpNP" (grayed out #ifndef UPNP...)? Wanna coordinate with BlueMatt to
get that done?
