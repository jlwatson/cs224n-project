I have a question  
Why we have "block/transaction versions" if we don't use it? There was a good
moment to increment version number and later use it in such way: if Miner gets
a "strange" block with increased version number -- it is a signal for him to
check for new soft. We could have avoided many of lost orphaned blocks  

We should have, but "we" didn't think of that in time.  
  
I've been working on a "how to do it better next time" document:
