The consensus from Tuesday's IRC meeting is to replace OP_EVAL with "pay-to-
script-hash" -- a simpler, safer-but-less-powerful alternative for creating
bitcoin addresses for multisignature and future more-complex transactions.  
  
So please read the BIP: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0016  
And the source: https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-
git/tree/pay_to_script_hash  
  
Important dates:  
Feb 1 deadline to try to get 50+% of hashing power to express support.  
Feb 15: "full validation" pay-to-script-hash switchover date (assuming success
on Feb 1)
