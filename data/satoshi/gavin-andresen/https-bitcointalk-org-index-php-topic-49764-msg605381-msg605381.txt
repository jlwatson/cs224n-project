Good question. The timeline for clients is less critical, as long as a
majority of hashing power will properly interpret OP_EVAL clients that
relay/generate those transactions can be rolled out anytime after Feb 1.  
  
So I'd suggest releasing a 0.5.something or 0.6 after the Jan 15 "are the big
miners on board" evaluation that turns on OP_EVAL support Feb 1.  
  
  
Same time.  
  
  
Another very good question. The timestamp in the block will be used to
determine whether OP_NOP1s in the block are interpreted as no-ops or OP_EVAL
when checking block validitity (wall-clock GMT time will be used to figure out
if the node should relay/mine OP_EVAL transactions). I'll double-check my
code, I think I did NOT code it that way.  
  
  
That seems exceedingly unlikely; once the big mining pools switch, there is a
very strong incentive for the smaller pools to switch, too.
