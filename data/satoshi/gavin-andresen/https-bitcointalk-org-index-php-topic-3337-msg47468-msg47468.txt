The Faucet has several abuse prevention features in place. I'm not going to
say what they are because then the 'bad guys' would have a road map for what
to do to try to get around them.  
  
They're not 100% foolproof, but they're pretty good.  
  
The steady stream of transactions from the Faucet the last few days IS because
of the increased interest due to the security now podcast and slashdot
mention.
