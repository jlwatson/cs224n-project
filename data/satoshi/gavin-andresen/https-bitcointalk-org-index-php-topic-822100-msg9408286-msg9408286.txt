  
This is a very important concept to internalize. I don't think Satoshi
realized it, and I think if he did Bitcoin Script would be very different from
what we have.  
  
In a future ideal world where arbitrary zero-knowledge-proofs are time-tested
and have robust implementations, everybody except for the N entities directly
involved in a transaction would validate a short, opaque proof that some
computation took place authorizing the transaction.  
  
If you're designing a better transaction system, you should design with that
ideal in mind.
