The keypool IS used for coin-generation transactions.  
  
And the way it is implemented, it should never throw away keys. If I recall
correctly, there is a very small chance if you lose power or bitcoin crashes a
key from the keypool could be used twice. But that has no bad effects, it is
just very unusual.
