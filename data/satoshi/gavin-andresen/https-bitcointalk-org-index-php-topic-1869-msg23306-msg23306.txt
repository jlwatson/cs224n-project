Also, I think there may be some cases where a keypool address would be thrown
away without a generation (like if Bitcoin crashes, or maybe even when it
shuts down).  

The keypool IS used for coin-generation transactions.  
  
And the way it is implemented, it should never throw away keys. If I recall
correctly, there is a very small chance if you lose power or bitcoin crashes a
key from the keypool could be used twice. But that has no bad effects, it is
just very unusual.
