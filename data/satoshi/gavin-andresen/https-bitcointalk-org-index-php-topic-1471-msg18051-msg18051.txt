I suspect (but am far from certain) that a couple of psychological factors in
the average human mind makes deflation worse than inflation.  
  
First, we've got an irrational attachment to "free" (see the book Predictably
Irrational for experiments that show this). If money is deflating, I can just
let it sit under my mattress for "free" -- and that might be more attractive
to me even though I'd get a better return by investing it. Investing ALWAYS
looks like it costs something (brokerage commissions or lawyers fees or...).  
  
And second, we've got an irrational aversion to loss and an irrational
attachment to stuff that we own. Investment means opening yourself up to the
possiblity of loss AND lending out something you own; I think a little bit of
inflation helps overcome that irrationality, by building in a little loss if
you stick your money under your mattress.  
  
I wonder if somebody could devise a small-scale experiment to figure out if
deflation is bad for investment, and/or measure the size of the effect...
