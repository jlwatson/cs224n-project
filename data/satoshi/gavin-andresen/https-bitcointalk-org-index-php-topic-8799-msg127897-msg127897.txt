Then a "stealth" client is needed, that functions as a dark node unless
specificly commanded to connect to a particular peer, or accept a particular
peer's requests. In fact, I want this client, portable on a thumbdrive.  

  
That is exactly what -connect does (if I recall correctly; you might need
-connect and -nolisten together).
