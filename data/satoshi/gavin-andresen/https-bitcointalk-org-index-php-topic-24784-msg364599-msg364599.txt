Does this patch give any sort of warning if bitcoin isn't being used through a
proxy?  
  
I worry that a user will be REALLY careful keeping all their addresses
separated so their ordinary transactions are separate from their fund-the-
oppositition transactions, and then will get busted by the Secret Police who
were eavesdropping on their bitcoin IP traffic at their ISP.
