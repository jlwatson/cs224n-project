I've started reverse-engineering and documenting the wallet and block
databases, and have written some Python code that deserializes many of the
Bitcoin data structures. I was going to let it ferment a little more before
announcing, but Mr. Google will surely find and index it soon, and it should
be a good head start for anybody who wants to start a Python bitcoin client.
