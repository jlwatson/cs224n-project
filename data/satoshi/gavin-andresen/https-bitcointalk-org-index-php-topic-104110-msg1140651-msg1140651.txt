testnet in a box is supposed to come with a huge balance "out of the box", but
I didn't make v3 so maybe it's not been done in the same way?

  
If I recall correctly, the first testnet-in-a-box node should have all the
coins. The second starts with a zero balance / empty wallet (send it coins
from the first if you need to...).
