I've not seen any way to resolve the problems with my original proposal; it
seems too easy to use a large amount of cash to reach back arbitrarily far in
the block chain to re-write history (and hence, invalidate transactions where
you spent money).  

  
... or, even worse, invalidate competing proof-of-stakes.  
  
I might like proof-of-stake schemes better if somebody has a good plan for how
to get them started-- you've got a genesis block, so the creator starts with
100% stake.  
  
Now what, exactly, happens to create block number 2 for proof-of-stake
systems?
