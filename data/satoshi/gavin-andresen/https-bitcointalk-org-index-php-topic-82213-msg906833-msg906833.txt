Gather (or generate) 3 bitcoin addresses, on whichever machines will be
participating, using getnewaddress or getaccountaddress RPC commands (or copy
and paste from the GUI).  
  
Get their public keys using the validateaddress RPC command 3 times.  
  
Then create a 2-of-3 multisig address using addmultisigaddress; e.g.  
  
addmultisigaddress returns the multisignature address. Be a little careful,
the public keys are raw hexadecimal and don't contain checksums like bitcoin
addresses do.  
  
You can then send funds into that 2-of-3 transaction using the normal
sendtoaddress/sendmany RPC commands, or the GUI (or anything that's been
updated to recognize multisig addresses).  
  
That will create a multi signature transaction.  
  
If you want to then SPEND the funds sent in that 2-of-3 transaction... that
isn't implemented yet (well, if bitcoin has all 3 private keys in it's wallet
then the funds will show up in the wallet's total balance and it may be
selected to be spent like any other funds received by the wallet). "We" need
to implement RPC calls to implement BIP 10 or something like it.
