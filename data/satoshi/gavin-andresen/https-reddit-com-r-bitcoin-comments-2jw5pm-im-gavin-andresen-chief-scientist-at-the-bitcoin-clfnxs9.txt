That's a great question for somebody who has studied how other Internet protocols evolve (or not) over time.

My guess is that protocol change will speed up again when some of the startups grow up a bit and have the time and resources to participate in a more formal standards-making, protocol-evolving process.

And then a few years later it will slow down again.
