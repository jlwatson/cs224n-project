Easy to say... but HOW should the Foundation vet corporate members?

That is why I'm asking if anybody can point to a successful organization that can be a role model for the Foundation to follow. The models I can think up are either US-centric (e.g. you must be a member in good standing of the Better Business Bureau), arbitrary (e.g. some person at the Foundation judges you "doesn't smell like a scam"), or are not open (e.g. "you must be nominated by two members in good standing").
