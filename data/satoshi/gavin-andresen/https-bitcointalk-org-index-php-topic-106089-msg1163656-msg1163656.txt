  
I've said that I think the download-and-install-software-on-your-PC is a
mostly-dead way of using software, and that the vast majority of people using
Bitcoin in a year or three will be using it via a web application or on their
smart phone. That's half of the reason why I don't think improving the UI is a
high priority right now (the other half is because I think solving wallet
security and backup issues is critical).  
  
RE: 2112 and GAAP: "patches welcome." I don't know nuthin about GAAP, so if
you're complaining that the reference implementation doesn't adhere to them
then I'm not surprised. Feel free to fix that, or write a detailed proposal on
what's wrong, why it'll cause problems, and how it ought to be fixed.  
  
RE: funding development: funding open source software projects is tricky; if
done poorly you end up with a couple of paid developers and lots of
disappointed unpaid former contributors who decide "I'm not gonna work if I'm
not gonna get paid."  
  
That said... stay tuned, and I'll say more when I can.
