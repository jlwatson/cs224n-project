The number of confirmations tells you which block a transaction is in:  
0 confirmations: not in a block yet.  
1 confirmation: in block number "getblockcount" block.  
2 : getblockcount-1  
... etc.  
  
Note that if there is a block chain reorganization which block the transaction
is in can change (as can the number of confirmations).
