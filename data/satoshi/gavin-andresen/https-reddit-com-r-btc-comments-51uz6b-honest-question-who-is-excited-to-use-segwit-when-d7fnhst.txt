It IS as simple as changing a 1 to a 2 for a lot of software. It is only more complicated for consensus-critical software (mining pools and solo miners or sophisticated merchants that care about low-number-of-confirmation transactions).

It is even simpler for most wallet software, which requires zero changes (they don't care about the block size).

Greg is great at poking holes and finding edge cases, and that's an awesome skill that I highly respect.

But it is terrible for building community or finding common ground for compromise where reasonable people can politely disagree about risks, benefits, and priorities.
