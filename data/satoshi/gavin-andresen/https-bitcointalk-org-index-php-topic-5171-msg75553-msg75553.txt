All this endless talking about the Perfect URI Scheme is very nice.  
  
So is anybody, you know, actually working on IMPLEMENTING something?  
  
You'll need to know how to write browser plugins for Firefox/Safari/Chrome/IE
and figure out how to pass arguments to a running bitcoin/bitcoind and know
how the bitcoin/bitcoind will prompt the user to confirm the transaction. Oh,
and figure out how to get the browser plugin(s) installed when bitcoin is
installed.  
  
Deciding on whether it is bitcoin:address or bitcoin://amount/address is the
easy part, and I think whoever actually does the work of making this happen
should define the standard.
