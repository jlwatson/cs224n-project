  
Quick reaction: what stops malicious or lazy BitX chain generator from
implementing a type of denial-of-service attack against some bit-app they
either don't like or don't know about? If BitX blocks are never rejected for
bit-app reasons, then what is the incentive for main-BitX chain generators to
include only (or any!) valid bit-app hashes? What stops me from constantly
flooding the BitX network with bogus bit-app hashes and asking them to be
included in BitX blocks?
