Conceptually you have a single BitX chain with several bit-app chains weaving
in and out of it. Generating a BitX block will then allow you to generate a
bitcoin block, a bitDNS block, a bit-foo block, etc.  
  
...  
  
The BitX chain is straight-forward although a key observation here is that
BitX blocks should never be rejected for bit-app reasons, i.e. a client should
be able to accept/reject a BitX block without ever downloading app blocks  

  
Quick reaction: what stops malicious or lazy BitX chain generator from
implementing a type of denial-of-service attack against some bit-app they
either don't like or don't know about? If BitX blocks are never rejected for
bit-app reasons, then what is the incentive for main-BitX chain generators to
include only (or any!) valid bit-app hashes? What stops me from constantly
flooding the BitX network with bogus bit-app hashes and asking them to be
included in BitX blocks?
