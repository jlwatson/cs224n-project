svnTEST branch is up on github.  
  
I also uploaded just the production-bitcoin-to-TEST-network-bitcoin patches to
github, at: http://gist.github.com/502460  
... so:  

Code:

curl
http://gist.github.com/raw/502460/2182724de9ef2d6721bf0e0962cc6a6895bcbee4 |
patch -l

... should patch production network source code to TEST network. And:  

Code:

curl
http://gist.github.com/raw/502460/2182724de9ef2d6721bf0e0962cc6a6895bcbee4 |
patch -l --reverse

... will go the other way.
