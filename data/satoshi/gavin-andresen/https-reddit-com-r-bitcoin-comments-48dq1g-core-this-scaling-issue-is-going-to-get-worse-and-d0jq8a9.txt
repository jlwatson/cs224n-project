You are confusing "block size limit" with "how big are blocks."

A 20MB limit would be perfectly safe-- if the network cannot handle 20MB blocks (and it can't right now) then miners won't produce 20MB blocks.

You will hear complicated arguments about "accidental selfish mining" and "advantages for larger miners" but they are just FUD -- ordinary selfish mining is a much better attack than "produce an expensive-to-validate-block and pray most people are not doing something smarter than single-threaded validation."

I have been listening very carefully to what they've been saying, have responded to every criticism raised, and have asked if I'm missing anything.  See http://gavinandresen.ninja/time-to-roll-out-bigger-blocks for links.
