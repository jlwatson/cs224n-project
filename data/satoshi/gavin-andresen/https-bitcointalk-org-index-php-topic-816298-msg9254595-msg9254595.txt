  
I am trying to get consensus. The process will look like:  
  
Get rough consensus. I need to write some code to find out what size blocks
the current code can handle, but other than that I think we're close to rough
consensus on the approach.  
  
Note: Getting consensus that we actually need to change something NOW will be
harder; it will be much easier to get consensus after we hit the 1MB blocksize
limit and transaction fees spike up. It would be lovely to avoid that
panic/pain.  
  
Implement the change / Write a BIP (these happen at about the same time).  
  
Submit a pull request, after code is reviewed pull it into the reference
implementation.  
  
... wait until there is a release containing the change...  
  
... wait until supermajority of miners have upgraded to the new release...  
  
Voila, the possibility of bigger blocks.
