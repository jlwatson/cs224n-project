  
It is definitely an issue-- the account code doesn't keep track of where the
coins it is sending out came from, so if you accept 0-confirmation coins
you're vulnerable to double-spending attacks (see, for example, the discussion
of the "Finney attack" in these forums).  
  
Seeing coins show up right away is a fantastic feature, though, so I'd suggest
getting the 0-confirmation balance and a 3+-confirmation balance, allowing
only 3+ confirmed coins to be withdrawn, and displaying the difference as
'waiting confirmation'.
