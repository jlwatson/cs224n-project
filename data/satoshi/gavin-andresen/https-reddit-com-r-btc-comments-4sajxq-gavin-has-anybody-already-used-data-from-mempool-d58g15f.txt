We need over-flowing blocks to get the data needed to answer the question.

Over-flowing blocks are a bad idea (never a good idea to run a network at 100% capacity, and never a good idea to possibly reduce adoption by driving away people who want to use your technology)... but that ship has sailed, we might as well make lemonade and see if we can get some numbers on how much money miners are losing because they aren't allowed to make their blocks any bigger.
