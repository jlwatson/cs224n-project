Are there any hard limits of to how far the daemon can scale or is this
limited by the underlying hardware?  

No hard limits, but the bitcoind "accounts" code hasn't been optimized for
that. For example, computing an account's balance loops through all
transactions in the wallet, so will take an increasing amount of time the more
transactions you have in the wallet.
