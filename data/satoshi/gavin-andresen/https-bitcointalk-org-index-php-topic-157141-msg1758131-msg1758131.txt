So the longer I think about the block size issue, the more I'm reminded of
this Hayek quote:  
  
  
We can speculate all we want about what is going to happen in the future, but
we don't really know.  
  
So, what should we do if we don't know? My default answer is "do the simplest
thing that could possibly work, but make sure there is a Plan B just in case
it doesn't work."  
  
In the case of the block size debate, what is the simplest thing that just
might possibly work?  
  
That's easy! Eliminate the block size limit as a network rule entirely, and
trust that miners and merchants and users will reject blocks that are
"obviously too big." Where what is "obviously too big" will change over time
as technology changes.  
  
What is Plan B if just trusting miners/merchants/users to do the right thing
doesn't work?  
  
Big-picture it is easy: Schedule a soft-fork that imposes some network-rule-
upper-limit, with whatever formula seems right to correct whatever problem
crops up.  
Small-picture: hard to see what the "right" formula would be, but I think it
will be much easier to define after we run into some actual practical problem
rather than guessing where problems might crop up.
