My Gox account was under 'Andresen' -- I changed my name years before Bitcoin existed.

I had no inside information about the collapse before it happened, I was told the problems with withdrawals were due to difficulty maintaining banking relationships.

I have never actively traded Bitcoin-- I used Gox only as a way of diversifying into other asset types as the price rose or for expenses I couldn't pay in BTC, so any bitcoins I sent there were converted into dollar wire transfers to my bank account as quickly as possible. I stopped using Gox as soon as they started taking weeks/months to process outgoing wire transfers.
