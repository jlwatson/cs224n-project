  
I still feel that way.  
  
I believe that if people want a secure network, they will figure out a way of
getting it. My justification is the same as my belief that if people want
clean, cheap, safe drinking water they will figure out a way of getting it.  
  
I don't claim to know **how** , and it is very possible the **how** will
offend the sensibilities of either (or both) of the "PRIVACY AT ANY COST!!!!"
or "DECENTRALIZATION AT ANY COST!!!!" factions. Just like government
regulations and institutions around clean water offend the "INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY
AT ANY COST!!!!" faction.  
  
I can imagine a lot of possible futures, from big merchants and exchanges
investing in mining to save themselves on transaction fees and ensure that
their transactions are confirmed securely, to assurance contracts, to a cartel
of miners regulated and funded and licensed as a global public utility.  
  
I hope that last one doesn't happen...
