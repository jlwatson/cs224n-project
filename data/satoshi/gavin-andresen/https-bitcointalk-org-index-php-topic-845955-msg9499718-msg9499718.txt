OP does have a point, Satoshi did walk away the moment Gavin accepted the
invitation to speak with the CIA. Coincidence?  

  
YES THAT WAS TOTALLY AND COMPLEETLY A COINCEDENCE!!!! HE WUZ PLANNING ON
LEAVING WAY BEFORE THAT!  
  
I THINK THE OP IS RIGHT, SO I'M GONNA MOVE THE SOURCE CODE TO SUMPLACE MORE
SECURE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T SEE IT ANYMORE. AND I WENT AND GOT ME A GOOD
HAT TO WEAR WHEN I WRITE CODE SO THEIR SATELITES CANT HEAR ME EITHER.  
  
FOR THE CHILDREN!  

Is this the real Gavin? Maybe someone hacked his account. I didn't expect that
he had a sense of humor. Too much stress to still be funny. can anyone
confirm?  

He is being sarcastic. He is trying to get across a point that having bitcoin
be open source is much better then it be closed source and the government not
have access to information about bitcoin  

  
Or maybe I just ate too much peyote one night (and, happily, decided to read
bitcointalk instead of write some code).  
  
(and for the humor-impaired: NO, NOT SERIOUS. Everybody knows I don't eat
peyote, I spend my money on hookers and blow.)
