I set the topic as sticky for a while because I think that if anything needs
extensive testing it's the software that handles our money.  

  
I would much rather people help test individual pull requests or 'git HEAD'
rather than "random collection of changes". Putting eleven unrelated changes
together makes figuring out what caused a bug/regression much harder.
