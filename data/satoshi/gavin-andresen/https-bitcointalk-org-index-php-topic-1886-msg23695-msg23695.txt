Is there no longer a way to place labels on a per-transaction basis?  

  
There never was a way to place labels on a per-transaction basis. It was
always a one-label-to-multiple-bitcoin-addresses association.  
  
But all of the old label functionality is still there, just renamed. You
should be able to do anything you were doing before.  
  
However, you might think you were doing something that you weren't actually
doing. There was no way to label/name particular transactions before (just
addresses).  
  
RE: the empty string as the default account: None of this is (or will be)
visible to GUI users, and if you're a programmer using the JSON or the
command-line interface SURELY you know how to quote strings.  
  
RE: hierarchical wallet keys: Huh? If you want trivial searching and
grouping... then export the info into a database and use SQL.
