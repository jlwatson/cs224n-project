You'd need 15 words to represent a bitcoin address; more if you include a
checksum (a very good idea, transpose two words without a checksum and you'd
get a "black hole" address).  
  
Creating a secure payment protocol so I can tell people "send payment to
gavinandresen@clearcoin.com" and be confident that I'll get the coins is very
high on my priority list.
