If you're interested in coin control, and you're comfortable with python and
the command-line, then I could use your help.  
  
I've written a little utility called 'spendfrom.py' that uses the raw
transactions JSON-RPC api to send coins received on particular addresses that
I'd like to ship in the contrib/ directory.  
  
But since it touches the wallet it needs thorough testing.  
  
I've written a test plan; who is willing to run through the test plan with
their -testnet wallet and then try to break it?  
  
Test plan:
