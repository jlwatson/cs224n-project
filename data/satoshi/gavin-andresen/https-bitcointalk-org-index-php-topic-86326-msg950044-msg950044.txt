I actually created and spent some "input from wallet a", "input from wallet b"
private testnet transactions earlier this week (I'm working on some lower-
level RPC commands for bitcoind -- see https://gist.github.com/2839617 for the
half-baked spec).  
  
Somebody could build a transaction-combining service on top of those low-level
RPC commands, although I suspect to be really resistant to sophisticated
network analysis doing "one or more inputs from A in, one or more from B in,
ApayToSomebody Achange BpayToSomebodyElse Bchange out" won't help much. There
is a lot of prior work on "mix networks" and maintaining anonymity, and the
only thing I know about it is that it is a hard problem to get right.
