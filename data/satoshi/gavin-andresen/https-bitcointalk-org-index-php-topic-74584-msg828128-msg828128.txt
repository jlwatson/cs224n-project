What is your definition of "truly mainstream" ?  
  
If 1% of the world uses Bitcoin for 1% of their transactions, then I'd still
consider it a huge success. I think there's a good chance that happens, but
that doesn't fit my definition of 'mainstream.'  
  
I think there is small possibility Bitcoin proper is used by a majority of
people in some country somewhere in the world use it at least once a week to
pay for things. I'd consider that mainstream success.  
  
I think there's a tiny possibility Bitcoin will eventually become as popular
as the dollar.  
  
But I'm not very good at predicting the future, so you might want to consult
you local fortune teller.
