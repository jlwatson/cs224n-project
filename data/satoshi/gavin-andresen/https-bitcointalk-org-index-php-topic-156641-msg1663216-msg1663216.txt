To be clear: the 'donor' was the EFF, and their only request was that the
Bitcoins be given back to the bitcoin community. If you like, think of it as a
bulk payment of transaction fees that the faucet would have paid if it had
been operating over the last year instead of closed (due to lack of time for
me to fight the scammers).  
  
Because it sent tiny transaction amounts, it paid almost as much in fees as it
gave out...
