so my question is this, if we take everything that is written in this article
for granted, would it even be technically possible to secure ones bitcoins on
a computer with one of these vPro processors?  

  
Relying on any single piece of hardware to secure your bitcoins is a bad idea.
In the future, you should use two pieces of hardware created in two different
parts of the world by two different organizations in two different legal
jurisdictions to secure your bitcoins.  
  
Right now... "only invest time or money you can afford to lose."
