  
That statement is incorrect.  
  
There are two ways you might waste time hashing:  
1) Put a bad BIP16 transaction in your block  
2) Building on top of a bad block produced by somebody else  
  
So even if you don't include anybody else's transactions in your blocks you
will still almost certainly waste some time hashing by building on top of
invalid blocks produced and announced by some other lazy miner running an old
version of bitcoind.
