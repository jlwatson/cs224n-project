I understand that but I thought when this idea was first presented it was said
that the user would keep both key's a in a backup wallet so you couldn't be
held hostage with your service provider.  

  
Yes, that's the use-case I care most about -- you have control over all of
your keys, you just put them in multiple places so if you lose control of
(say) your computer you don't lose your bitcoins.  
  
But there are other use-cases, like you agreeing to let the government control
half the keys, so the government can "guarantee" the transactions, etc. I can
imagine the PR campaign: "It is just like Federal Deposit Insurance (FDIC),
only for Bitcoin!"  
  
I don't think that will ever happen, though. I know I wouldn't trust the
government to keep the keys to my money safe and secure, I don't think most
people would, either. More likely is most people will trust banks to hold half
the keys, and the governments will then regulate the banks like they do today
to get information about who is paying who for what....
