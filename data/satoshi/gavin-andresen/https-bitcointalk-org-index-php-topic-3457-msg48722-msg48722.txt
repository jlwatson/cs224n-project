Here's what happens when you press the Get Some button on the Faucet and it
sends you coins:  
  
\+ A Google App Engine task is scheduled to actually do the send.  
  
\+ The send tasks are (currently) scheduled to run at most once per minute, so
huge spikes in demand for coins from the faucet are smoothed out.  
  
The nice thing about App Engine tasks is that they're persistent little
buggers-- they'll keep going until they succeed. If the send fails for some
reason (I need to restart bitcoind for some reason, or the connection between
the Google and my bitcoind server is down), App Engine will reschedule the
task to try again after an hour.  
  
So, you were probably just very unlucky and the send failed twice in a row, OR
you on the tail end of a couple hundred people all asking for coins at about
the same time (the faucet will service a maximum of 120 requests in two
hours).
