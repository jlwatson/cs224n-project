RE: how many free keys are in the pool:  
  
By default, there are at least 100 free keys in the pool, always.  
  
When a key is taken out, if the number of free keys drops below 100 (or the
-keypool= number) another is generated.  
  
Keys are put back if they're unused-- for example, a key is needed for every
miner hashing thread, so if you're on a 4-core machine and turn on coin
generation and then turn it back off you'll wind up with 104 keys in the free
pool.  
  
But for most people most of the time there will be exactly 100 free keys.
