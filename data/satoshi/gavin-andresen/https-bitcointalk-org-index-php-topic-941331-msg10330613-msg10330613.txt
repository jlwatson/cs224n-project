What's the problem with paying 10 bucks instead of 10 cents to securely
transfer a million dollars?  

  
What's wrong?  
  
Lets say those million dollar transactions are 250 bytes. That is 4,000 of
them in a 1MB block.  
  
So $40,000 total reward to the miner -- about eight times current block
reward.  
  
BUT YOU ARE SECURING TRANSACTIONS WORTH SOMETHING LIKE 2,000 TIMES MORE
VALUABLE THAN TODAY'S TRANSACTIONS (estimated average transaction USD value
for today's average transaction is about $380). And I GUARANTEE that attackers
would have a much easier time pulling off a double-spend of one million-dollar
transaction than 1,000 $1,000 transactions.  
  
The math for "large value transactions will generate enough fees to secure the
chain" just doesn't work.  
The math for "lots of small transactions will generate enough fees to secure
the chain" might.  
  
Also:  
  
I still haven't heard a coherent argument on why large value transactions are
necessarily also high-fee transactions.  
  
I'd suggest you go research existing high-value-payment networks and see what
typical fees are for multi-million dollar transactions. FEDWIRE is running at
6 transactions per second, average transaction value over $6million, with fees
per transaction **UNDER ONE DOLLAR.**  
  
Why? Because if you are giving somebody one million dollars for something, you
almost certainly have built up real-world trust, and probably have a
longstanding relationship, signed contracts, etc etc.  
  
If you think Bitcoin is different, please explain the scenario where I send a
stranger who I don't trust (so have to rely completely on the blockchain)
$1million for something.
