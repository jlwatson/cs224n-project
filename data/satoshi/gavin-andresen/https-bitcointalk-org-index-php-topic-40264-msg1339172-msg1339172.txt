What about this... The owner of a website puts a file on their website called
bitcoin_tags.json or something like that. This would server a similar purpose
to sitemap.xml but instead contains a number of bitcoin addresses and labels.  
  
For example http://wikileaks.org/bitcoin_tags.json  
  
{  
"tags" : {  
"address" : "1HB5XMLmzFVj8ALj6mfBsbifRoD4miY36v",  
"tag" : "Donations",  
"sig" : "signature of concatenated tag and domain"  
}  
}  
  
Once the owner of a website has added the file they can suggest that
blockchain.info indexes it, once indexed blockchain.info will display the new
tag accordingly. This has the advantage of.  
  
* maintainable, webmaster can update bitcoin_tags.json as they choose. Deadlinks will be removed from the database.   
* Decentralised, any service can index tags.  
* More secure, both the domain and the address signature is verified. Tags can be independently verified if necessary and little moderation is needed.  

  
You should only trust tags fetched via https, otherwise a man-in-the-middle
could hijack the .json file and replace the address and signature.  
  
(and I think you'd want "tags" to be an Array of Objects...)

using ECC math to tie a hash to a transaction without any blockchain bloat?
