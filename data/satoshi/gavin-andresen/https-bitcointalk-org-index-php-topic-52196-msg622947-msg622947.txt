I had grand plans to make this the center of a Linux-powered multimedia
center... but after doing nothing with it for a couple of months I think I
just won't ever have the time.  
  
  
This is an Intel Atom D410 -powered little computer, with 1GB of memory and a
250GB hard disk, running a custom version of Linux (easily upgraded to the
latest Ubuntu or other Linux distro by booting from a USB stick, though).  
  
Like new in the original box with all the original parts (keyboard, mouse,
stand, power cable). New at Amazon: $229  
  
Selling for 90 BTC, I'll pay shipping to the US or Canada.
