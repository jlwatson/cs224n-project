Sure-- I've always liked the BitTorrent/W3C model because it is less
centralized (lots of different implementations of the protocol, as opposed to
a project like Perl, where essentially everybody runs the same code). I
consider Satoshi's code the "reference" client, though, not "proof-of-
concept", since there is no formal specification.  
  
(I've written a formal specification, and I think having a working reference
implementation is better than An Officially Blessed Pile of Paper).
