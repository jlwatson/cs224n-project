But... but... video on the Internet is CENTRALIZED! If you want everybody in the world to see your video you have to pay for a bunch of servers!!!!

Thatâ€™s not FAIR!!!!!!!  Until anybody can serve all the videos in the world to all the people in the world (and that is n-squared!!!) from their phone we MUST limit the size of files!
