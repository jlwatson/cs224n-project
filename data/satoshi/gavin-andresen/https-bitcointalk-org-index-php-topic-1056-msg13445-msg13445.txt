RE: hippich XML/JSON:  
XML ain't gonna happen, and I think JSON is overkill for this. Using the same
format as the bitcoin.conf file is the right answer, I think (easy to
implement, human-readable, comments allowed in the file, easy to extend as
necessary). That's what I mocked up at skypaint.com.  
  
RE: nimnul http://localhost:.../  
If you've never installed bitcoin, or bitcoin isn't running already, you get
an unhelpful error message. One advantage of a "payment request file" is many
users will understand that you need something called "Bitcoin" to open a
"Bitcoin Payment Request" file.  
  
RE: mizerydearia Linux support:  
In my research I briefly an across a reference to a KDE startup file to
associate mime types with applications, so I _think_ it would work nicely
cross-platform if you've already installed bitcoin. (UPDATE: cross-desktop
spec here)  
  
RE: nimnul clipboard monitoring:  
Seems to me that's a feature for geeks, because only geeks would happen to
know that if you highlight a bitcoin address when bitcoin was running you
could automatically launch bitcoin. And there's no way that would be turned on
by default. And it also seems to me clipboard monitoring is perfect for a
standalone, general-purpose utility ("if selection matches any of THESE
regepxs, launch THAT applications with arguments "beginpayment %{address}
%{amount}" ... ).  
  
RE: mizerydearia portable devices:  
I've never programmed for Android or iPhone; anybody know how they handle non-
standard MIME types? Can apps register themselves as content handlers?  
  
  
  
Thinking about actually implementing this, the hard part is getting a running
(or just launched) Bitcoin's attention in a cross-platform way. Using the
existing command-line control (which uses JSON-RPC under the covers) would be
the most straightforward, but that requires that you set a rpcuser/rpcpassword
in the bitcoin.conf file AND run bitcoind or bitcoin -server. Yuck.  
  
I suppose, as a special case, payment request JSON-RPC calls could be allowed
with no rpcpassword, and -server could be made the default. Makes me a little
nervous, though.  
  
Running bitcoin /path/to/browser/cache/with/payment_request_file (which is
what the web browsers will do) should:  
IF bitcoin isn't running: launch it, and **wait** until it is ready to receive
payment request messages  
Send running bitcoin (...somehow...) "Hey, we got a payment request here for
you to deal with" messgae.
