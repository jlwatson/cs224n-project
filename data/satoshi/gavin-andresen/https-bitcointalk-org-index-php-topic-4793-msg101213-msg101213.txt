Maybe link to instawallet.org should be added to the getting started page?  

  
Nothing against jav, but I think instawallet needs a month or three of 'soak
time' to give the scammers and script kiddies time to try to break it (and to
see how jav reacts to the scammers and script kiddies trying to break it...).
