Micon could you please get your ass out of all these threads I like to follow?
You're making it quite hard for me with all he off-topic unsubstantiated
nonsense you're constantly repeating. If you do not comply I will start
reporting every such post of yours to the modsto try ad get you removed from
these forums instead and adviseothers to do the same.  

Yeah, don't do that, you'll annoy some of us moderators.  
  
I think Micon is doing the moral thing, warning people of what he thinks are
scams.  
  
I think they're scams, too. It is impossible to get risk-free 1.5% weekly
interest, I don't care how good you are at "playing the market" or "choosing
who to lend to."
