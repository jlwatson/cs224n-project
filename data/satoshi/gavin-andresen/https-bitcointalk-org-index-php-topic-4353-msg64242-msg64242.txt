  
In my head I was imagining a way of telling bitcoin to subscribe to some
service(s) that did the mapping-- maybe a setting in the GUI where you could
specify "use these six services, in this order, to try to resolve bitcoin
addresses that aren't plain-old-bitcoin-addresses." With the services
specified by name+URL (and some standard REST-ful protocol was defined for
mapping string to bitcoin address). Or maybe name+pattern+URL.  
  
I haven't looked at genjix' patch, and haven't thought deeply about security
issues-- but I bet there are lots...
