I believe that the statement: "bitcoin is new kind of money" passes the duck
test.  
  
Bitcoins function as money (they're a unit of account, a medium of exchange,
and a store of value), and if PayPal started allowing Bitcoin transactions
tomorrow I'm certain they'd treat them as Just Another Currency.  
  
If you like, call it a commodity, but I think all you'll accomplish is
confusing potential users who might think they'll end up getting pork-bellies
delivered to their porch if they don't get rid of their bitcoins.
