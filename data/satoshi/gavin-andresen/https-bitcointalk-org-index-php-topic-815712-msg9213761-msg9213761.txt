Of course one can say, let's put it 50% per year until the bandwidth stops
growing that fast,  
and then we fork again. But this only postpones the problem. Trying to predict
now exactly when this happens, and to program for it now, seems futile.  

  
Okey dokey. My latest straw-man proposal is 40% per year growth for 20 years.
That seems like a reasonable compromise based on current conditions and
trends.  
  
You seem to be looking hard for reasons not to grow the block size-- for
example, yes, CPU clock speed growth has stopped. But number of cores put onto
a chip continues to grow, so Moore's Law continues. (and the reference
implementation already uses as many cores as you have to validate
transactions)  
  
PS: I got positive feedback from a couple of full-time, professional
economists on my "block size economics" post, it should be up tomorrow or
Friday.
