  
Okey dokey. My latest straw-man proposal is 40% per year growth for 20 years.
That seems like a reasonable compromise based on current conditions and
trends.  
  
You seem to be looking hard for reasons not to grow the block size-- for
example, yes, CPU clock speed growth has stopped. But number of cores put onto
a chip continues to grow, so Moore's Law continues. (and the reference
implementation already uses as many cores as you have to validate
transactions)  
  
PS: I got positive feedback from a couple of full-time, professional
economists on my "block size economics" post, it should be up tomorrow or
Friday.
