Am I correct in my understanding that:  
a) There is a single block chain for the whole world at all times  

  
No. The end of the chain can, and does, fork, but the forks are short and the
network pretty quickly decides on the One True Chain.

b) The block chain contains a record of every bitcoin transaction that has
ever taken place  

Yes.

c) The entire block chain must be downloaded in order for a client to use
bitcoin  

Short answer: no.  
  
Longer answer: it is complicated, and what you need depends on whether or not
you're trying to generate new blocks. To keep it simple, the original client
downloads everything.
