Accuracy/precision is a red-herring unless you're treating numbers as strings,
since JSON-RPC numbers ARE ALWAYS double-precision floating point numbers
(according to the JavaScript/ECMAScript spec). Bitcoin could send a number
that looks like 2100000000000001, but the code that interprets that JSON-RPC
number will convert it into an inexact double-precision floating-point
equivalent. And then the code that displays that number will have to decide
how to round and format that inexact floating point number and display it to
the user.  
  
When we need more than 51 bits of precision (wouldn't THAT be a fantastic
problem to have!), then we'd HAVE to send numbers as strings, and have the
JavaScript (or whatever) on the other end feed them into a bignum-type library
to handle them.
