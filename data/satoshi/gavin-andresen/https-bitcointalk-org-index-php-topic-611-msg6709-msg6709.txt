It's pretty common to turn maps into objects, so you can use syntax like:  
foo.tx_id  
... instead of foo['tx_id']. Especially if you're doing something like passing
the data into a templating system (which may ONLY understand the object.field
syntax).  
  
And foo.class just doesn't work out nicely.
