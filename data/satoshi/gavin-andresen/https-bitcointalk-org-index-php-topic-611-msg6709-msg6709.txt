Couple of quick suggestions:  
  
Using the key name "class" will cause problems for, at least, JavaScript, and
probably other languages where "class" is a reserved word. "type" or "variety"
or some other synonym will cause fewer problems later.  

  
Can you be more specific? All mainstream programming language seem sensibly
insensitive to abitrary string contents, JS included. String content can
certainly include language-reserved keywords and parsing tokens.  

It's pretty common to turn maps into objects, so you can use syntax like:  
foo.tx_id  
... instead of foo['tx_id']. Especially if you're doing something like passing
the data into a templating system (which may ONLY understand the object.field
syntax).  
  
And foo.class just doesn't work out nicely.
