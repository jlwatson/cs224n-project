Good advice, but too 'Buck Rodgers Secret Decoder Ring!' for my taste.

I'd say: buy a bitcoin wherever is most convenient (e.g. Coinbase).

Print a paper wallet on a computer that isn't acting wonky. Send the Bitcoin to the paper wallet.

Put it in a zip-loc bag in your safe deposit box (best, but you do have to remember to pay for it every year) or safe.

If you were storing 100+ BTC then unplugging and then destroying computers in case of malware and being paranoid about your future government confiscating your paper wallet for some future wealth tax starts to make sense.
