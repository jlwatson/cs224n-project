Is it OK to require people to pass a drug test before getting welfare
benefits?  
  
If you're a conservative, you probably think: "Sure! It is against the law to
take drugs, and giving welfare to drug addicts just encourages their illegal,
self-destructive behavior."  
  
If you're a liberal, you probably think: "No! Drug users are some of the most
disadvantaged members of our society, denying them benefits is just heartless
and will make their problems worse, and testing innocent people is demeaning
and violates their human rights."  
  
Who is right? What should the government do?  
  
I wish people would spend less time arguing about questions like this and
realize that the real problem is we've got a winner-take-all system where
"There Shall Be One Correct Answer."  
  
It doesn't have to be that way.
