I did a transaction about 2 hours ago and it is staying at 0/unconfirmed, the
recipient has no credit showing or even an unconfirmed line... The coins seems
to disapeared in the void...  
Should I wait is this just a transaction that is going to take exceptionally
long?  

  
Are you still downloading the block chain? If you don't already have all
70,000+ blocks in the block chain, then you transaction won't show up as
confirmed until you catch up.
