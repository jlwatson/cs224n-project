Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn also deserves recognition; he warned us that the method
Bitcoin uses to compute the Merkle tree was possibly insecure (although at the
time we couldn't see how to turn it into an exploit).  
  
This was a nasty bug; if Forrest hadn't found it and responsibly reported it,
an attacker probably could have stopped most of the nodes on the network
before we got patched code out. It is bugs like this that make me think that
having several different implementations of the Bitcoin protocol is a good
idea.
