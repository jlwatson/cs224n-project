Multiple Dr. Evil type of characters including Gavin Andresen (Notice
Mr.Anderson) have been tinkering in their underground facility thinking of new
ways to destroy the free economy along with their CIA friends as the camera
zooms out of the darkness you can only hear their evil laughing as they summon
this patch from the deepest dungeons of hell to completely censor any micro
transactions or _"dust"_ in hopes of probing the masses for compliance before
further arbitrary, dictatorship-style changes take place.  

  
Nah, I'm not in the underground facility any more. I packed up the hookers and
blow and we're all living the sweet life in a penthouse suite now.
