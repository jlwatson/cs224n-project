When I was in school, the Big Bad Boogey-Man was Russia, and we were afraid of
nuclear war.  
  
I remember "duck and cover" drills in school, in case of nuclear attack.  
  
Looking back, wasn't that unnecessary fear-mongering? And not just because
there didn't happen to be a nuclear war. But because if there WAS a nuclear
war, getting cut by flying glass because you didn't hide under your desk when
the air raid sirens went off would be the least of your worries.  
  
Today's Big Bad Boogey-Man are strangers in schools. We've had two incidents
in Amherst this week where schools went into "lockdown" -- one ridiculous
false alarm, and one genuine "somebody creepy and probably mentally
unbalanced."  
  
Which makes my skeptical mind wonder: is that just unnecessary fear-mongering?
How many times has a school going into "lockdown" saved lives or injury? Can
anybody point me to even one story of "Thank God we went into lockdown, that
homicidal maniac found the doors locked and just gave up!"  
  
Kids are much safer in school than any other place, despite the high-profile,
tragic, terrible incidents that happen somewhere in the world once or twice a
year. Kids in US schools are much safer overall than they have ever been.  
  
And it's not because we're locking down our schools; adults in the US are much
safer from violence than they've ever been.  
  
I also remember learning to sing about how we're supposed to be living in "the
land of the free, and the home of the brave." Locking our kids in their
classrooms because we're so afraid of strangers in our schools is teaching
them exactly the opposite.
