There are three stages to the rollout:  
  
1\. Before 75% are producing block.version=2 blocks: no special checking  
2\. Between 75 and 95% : block.version=2 blocks MUST have height in coinbase.
We are here.  
3\. 95% or more: all blocks MUST be block.version=2 and MUST have height in
coinbase. Should happen soon.  
  
Shell script to count block versions:  
  

Code:

gavin$ for i in {225925..226925}; do ./bitcoind getblock $(./bitcoind
getblockhash $i); done | grep version | sort | uniq -c  
173 "version" : 1,  
828 "version" : 2,
