I am sad that all gavin's work have been wasted!  

  
Don't be sad-- it hasn't been wasted at all. Most of the work was making
multisignature transactions work properly, the OP_EVAL part was a small amount
of code (which becomes an even smaller amount of code under the new
PayToScriptHash scheme, which is one of the reasons I like it).  
  
And re: new cycle of coding/testing/etc taking 3 more months: I'm going to
propose slipping the schedule by two weeks, which means a "network is fully
validating the new transaction types" of Feb 15 instead of Feb 1.
