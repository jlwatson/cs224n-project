... so to solve the problem we should decrease the block size?  Or do you have some other solution in mind?

I propose that "we" make propagating big blocks as fast as small blocks. See my latest blog post for why I believe we should "design ahead" in the protocol: http://gavinandresen.ninja/designing-for-success

If you'd like to help, there is plenty to do. Participate in the -testnet tests that jtoomim is running, or help test Mike's "thin blocks" patch.

If you're not willing to help, the phrase "lead, follow, or get out of the way" comes to mind....
