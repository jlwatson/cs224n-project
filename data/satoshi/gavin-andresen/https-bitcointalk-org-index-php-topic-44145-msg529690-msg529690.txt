sendfrom needs the minconf to know if it should fail because of too few
confirmed coins in the account.  
  
move used to need minconf for essentially the same reason, but as of (some
release in the past) it always succeeds.  
E.g. if account A has 5 0-confirmation bitcoins and 5 1-confirmation bitcoins
then:  
move "A" "B" 10  
... used to fail, because A's 1-confirmation balance was only 5.  
  
Now it will succeed, giving it a -5 one-confirmation balance. move "A" "B" 100
will also now always succeed, making A's balance go negative.
