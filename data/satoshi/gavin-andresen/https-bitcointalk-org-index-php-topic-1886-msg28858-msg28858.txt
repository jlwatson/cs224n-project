  
Accounts do not affect the previous-transaction-selection algorithm at all; if
you sendfrom FOO, bitcoin doesn't make any effort to only use coins that were
received by FOO.  
  
Think of your wallet as being a big pool of coins. Coins are not stamped with
account names when they go in, instead, there's a little man with a green
visor making entries in a ledger.  
  
Each receiving address is a pipe that dumps coins into the pool, and the
little man knows which pipes are assigned to each account.  
  
Every send the little man grabs his shovel and picks a bunch of coins randomly
from the pool. Then debits an account.  
  
And for moves, the little man doesn't have to touch the coins in the pool at
all, he just adjusts his ledger.
