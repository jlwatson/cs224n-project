A half-baked thought that's been bouncing around my head for the last couple
of days:  
  
One piece of functionality missing from bitcoin is the ability for somebody to
prove that they own a certain bitcoin address.  
  
I'm thinking that if there was a way to ask bitcoin to:  
1) Sign an arbitrary bunch of data with a bitcoin address' private key, and
return the signature.  
2) Take a bitcoin address and signed data and verify that the signature is
valid.  
  
... then maybe that could function as the building block allowing webs of
trust to develop in an application independent of 'core bitcoin'.  
  
And secure, pseudo-anonymous communication between people who know only each
other's bitcoin addresses. And probably a bunch of other interesting things I
haven't thought of.
