I don’t think anybody knows how long the average channel will stay open. Will there be a lot of churn in hubs as people decide (for whatever reason) to stop running a hub and cash out locked up funds?

Will security vulnerabilities in popular Linux distributions result in hubs closing channels as attackers drain them?

Will everybody use highly centralized but highly reliable (24/7 sysadmin behind the hub) ‘up forever’ hubs?
