Sirius runs the website.

Quick "why no proper SSL cert" : because it never made it near the top of
anybody's TODO list. The task is:  
\+ Figure out where the bitcoin.org domain is registered and make sure the MX
records/etc are pointing somewhere so verification emails from the certificate
authority don't get lost.  
\+ buy the cert and jump through the 'verify you are who you say you are'
hoops.  
\+ replace the self-signed cert on the web server
