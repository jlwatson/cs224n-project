Arnold Kling  _concisely_  expresses something I've been thinking about a lot
lately:  

> The minimum wage issue is high on symbolism and low on substance.

It feels to me like 98% of the political debate I see is over issues that, in
the grand scheme of things, don't really matter.  
  
There are issues that people really, truly, care deeply about. That they get
emotional about. That they organize around and march on Washington and make
demands.  
  
Abortion. Minimum Wage. Legalizing Marijuana. Children Being Abducted By
Strangers. Student loans. Global warming. Peak Oil. Gay marriage. Israel. The
Terrorist Threat.  
  
All high symbolism, low substance.  
  
Or, to put it another way: 100% solve any of those issues (in whatever
direction your political leanings say they should be solved) and I think the
world would look pretty much like it does now.  Slightly better, but not a lot
better.  
  
Immigration. Disease. Empowering Individuals / Disempowering Despots. Better
Governance ("It's The System, Stupid"). Tolerance.  
  
High substance, often low symbolism. I wish we spent more time talking about
things that, if fixed, would make the world much better.
