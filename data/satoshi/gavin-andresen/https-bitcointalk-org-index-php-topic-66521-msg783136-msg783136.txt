RE: tx replacement:  
  
Somebody aught to start experimenting with transaction replacement with
testnet-in-a-box.  
  
Put together a test plan, modify the code and try to break it.  
  
Assuming it all works, submit a pull request to enable transaction replacement
on testnet (with a pointer to your test plan and results of testing, please).  
  
Then we can start trying to break transaction replacement on testnet; again,
assuming no bugs/hacks/issues turn up after "enough" testing, and if there's
general consensus that the benefits outweigh the risks, it could be rolled out
to the production network.  
  
We just pulled a DoS fix involving filling up memory with orphan transactions;
one concern with transaction replacement is DoS (could I fill up the memory
pool by spamming "will be replaced" transactions?)
