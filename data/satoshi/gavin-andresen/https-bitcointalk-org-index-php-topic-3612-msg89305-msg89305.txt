Ok I tried accessing windows AMI with remote desktop using the ip address(?)
as the name of the remote computer (after starting the instance in Amazon) and
it wouldn't connect. Can someone help a non-techie figure out what I'm doing
wrong?  

  
When you launch your instance, make sure the firewall ("Security Group" in
AWS-speak) is setup to allow remote desktop access from your machine's IP
address to port 3389.  
  
I run Remote Desktop Client on my Mac, but the process should be the same on
PC.  
  
Connect using the "Public DNS" machine name-- something like:
ec2-184-2-91-236.compute-1.amazonaws.com  
  
Login as Administrator, password: bitcoin development  
  
(I just launched the 0.3.20.2 Windows AMI to get ready to build a 0.3.21
release candidate).
