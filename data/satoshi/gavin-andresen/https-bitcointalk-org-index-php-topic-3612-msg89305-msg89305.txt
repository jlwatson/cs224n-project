  
When you launch your instance, make sure the firewall ("Security Group" in
AWS-speak) is setup to allow remote desktop access from your machine's IP
address to port 3389.  
  
I run Remote Desktop Client on my Mac, but the process should be the same on
PC.  
  
Connect using the "Public DNS" machine name-- something like:
ec2-184-2-91-236.compute-1.amazonaws.com  
  
Login as Administrator, password: bitcoin development  
  
(I just launched the 0.3.20.2 Windows AMI to get ready to build a 0.3.21
release candidate).
