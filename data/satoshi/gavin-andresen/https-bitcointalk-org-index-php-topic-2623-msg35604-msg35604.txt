Very nice! Let me ask some dumb questions:  
  
  
What does PPA stand for?  
  
Does launchpad help solve the 'trusted build' problem-- e.g. does the build
process automatically fetch from source code that we can all look at and
audit?  
  
How hard would it be to setup something similar to produce regular builds of
the github integration repository?  
  
Right now, the bitcoin build process is "Satoshi does it." Using Launchpad to
create the Linux builds seems like the right way to go.  
  
Last dumb question: are there services similar to Launchpad for building
Mac/Windows software?
