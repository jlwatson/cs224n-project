Because the first byte in a bitcoin address is a version number, and "version
0" is encoded as a "1" in the bitcoin address "base58 encoding" (because 0 is
too easy to confuse with capital-o).  
  
Trivia: -testnet addresses are version 111 (eleven is my favorite number), and
begin with m or n (I haven't actually worked out whether they might begin with
another letter, too...).
