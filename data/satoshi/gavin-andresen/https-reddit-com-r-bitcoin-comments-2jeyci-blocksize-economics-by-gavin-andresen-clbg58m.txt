I think I followed you right up to "If blockspace were unlimited..."

One of the main points of the blog post is that blockchain security and maximum block size may have very little to do with each other. Increasing/decreasing/keeping-the-same maximum block size won't solve the Tragedy of the Commons how do we secure the blockchain problem.

The first statement does is *not* saying there is a relationship between fees and people's desire for a functioning network. It just says that fees will not drop to zero, assuming economically rational miners and non-zero desire for people to make Bitcoin transactions.

That says nothing about whether or not those fees would be enough to secure the network.
