The 5-minute Ignite! talk I did about Bitcoin is up:

It was mostly what I wanted to say; I think I ended better than I started. My
slides and script  
with exactly what I planned to say are here:

Feel free to remix it. If I ever do another Ignite! talk (they're 5 minute
talks with slides that auto-advance ever 15 seconds) I'll plan to say less,
try to interact with the audience more, and may hire somebody (with bitcoins,
of course) to replace my text-heavy slides with more pretty pictures.
