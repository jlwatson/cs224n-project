By the way, an important question: if I generate a 500KB block with only free
transactions in it, it will be accepted by the network, right?  
Or this current "default fee policy" is not just for the default client, but
for the protocol as a whole?  

  
You can generate a 1MB block with only free transactions in it and it will get
accepted (maximum block size is 1MB, although the standard bitcoin client will
never generate blocks larger than 500K).

That sounds like the pool needs to do it differently, not the network. If this
is a pool payout to 500 people in a single transaction, then the pool needs to
break it down into smaller transactions. I sent a few regular transactions
yesterday and they were immediately included in solved blocks.  

  
The problem isn't the pool payout-- the problem is that people participating
in the pool end up with wallets full of tiny (e.g. penny-size) transactions.
When they go to spend those tiny transactions, they're bundled up together to
make a transaction that is small in value but large in size.  
  
Pools can mitigate the problem by requiring larger minimum payouts (e.g. 1 BTC
instead of 0.01 BTC).
