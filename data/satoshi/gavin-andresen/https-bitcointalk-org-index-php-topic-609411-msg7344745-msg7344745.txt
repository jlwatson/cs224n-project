I haven't been paying to the whole "cloud hashing" thing, but it seems to me a
great cover for an old-fashioned Ponzi scheme.  
  
1\. Take investors BTC, "buy" gigahashes of mining.  
2\. Pay them back for a while using new investor's BTC.  
3\. Once you've got enough investors, take the BTC and run.  
(maybe claim "oops, sorry, got hacked")  
  
I'm not saying CEX.IO is a tarted-up Ponzi scheme. I have no idea.  
  
I'm just asking how everybody who is giving them money knows that they aren't
a Ponzi. Or aren't selling the same hardware twice or three times, operating a
kind of 'fractional reserve' system (that will eventually fall apart).  
  
Excuse me in advance if this has been discussed and I'm just missing something
(e.g. a variation on Greg Maxwell's exchange auditing scheme might work: e.g.
"they publish all the blocks found and an auditable merkle tree of all
customers and how much hashing power each has").
