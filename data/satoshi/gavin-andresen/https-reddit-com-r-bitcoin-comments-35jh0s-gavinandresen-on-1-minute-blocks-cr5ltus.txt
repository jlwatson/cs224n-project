Jeepers creepers, I can’t have a half-baked opinion on ANYTHING anymore, can I?

I do think 1-minute blocks would pass a cost/benefit analysis; benefits would be less variance in confirmations-for-whatever-level-of-security (e.g. wait 60 1-minute confirmations has much lower variance than wait 6 10-minute confirmations).

I think it would probably encourage mining decentralization. Easier to solo mine if you’re competing for 1.25 BTC 1-minute block instead of a 12.5 BTC 10-minute block.

… that might not be true, would have to run the numbers for disadvantage due to higher orphan rates....

I have no opinion on whether or not the adjust-difficulty-every-2-weeks should be changed if the block time was changed, but that’s something else to think about.

Disadvantage is that SPV nodes would have to download more headers, but that’s not a huge disadvantage and I think the benefits of an SPV node finding out about a re-org / double-spend quicker probably outweigh them.

One minute is not fast enough for real-time payments, so that’s neither an advantage or disadvantage.

Whether or not to change the 10-minute block time is a separate issue (with its own pros and cons) from whether or not the max block size should change. Status-quo with a faster block time would be 100K max blocks, each with one-tenth the current mining reward.
