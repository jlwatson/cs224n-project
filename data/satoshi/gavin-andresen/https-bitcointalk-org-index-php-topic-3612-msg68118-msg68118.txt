Gavin,  
  
Did you get a chance to build using the gitian process? Would be cool to
compare hashes.  
  

  
I didn't-- the first "community build" took long enough as it was, and I
didn't want to add one more 'different from the way it was done before'
variable.  
  
Next release I want to automate some of the manual steps, and maybe use the
gitian process, assuming it will work inside an Amazon VM (DO nested virtual
machines work?). Unless anybody feels motivated to step in and do it first;
with a verifiable build, anybody can take on the role of build-meister.
