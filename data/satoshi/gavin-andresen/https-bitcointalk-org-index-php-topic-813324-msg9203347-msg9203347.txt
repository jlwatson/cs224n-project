I propose the following rule to determine the block size limit, once the block
reward is low  
 **The block size limit would increase (or decrease), by X%, if total
transaction fees in the last N blocks is Y Bitcoin or more (or less).**  
  
......  
  
I am aware miners could also manipulate fees by including transactions with
large fees and not broadcasting these to the network. However why would miners
in this scenario want to manipulate the limit upwards?  

  
The fear is that a cartel of big, centralized, have-huge-data-pipes miners
would drive out smaller miners by forcing up the block size high enough so the
smaller miners have to drop out.
