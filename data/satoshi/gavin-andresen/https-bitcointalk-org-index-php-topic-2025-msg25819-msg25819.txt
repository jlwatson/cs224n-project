The "accounts" feature (to replace "labels") is done for now: listtransactions
and gettransaction are implemented, and move, sendfrom, and getbalance
<account> are enabled.  
  
This should make implementing web services much easier; you can assign each
customer their own 'account' and rely on bitcoin to keep track of exactly how
many bitcoins they have, have it return a list of the customer's last N
transactions, etc.  
  
This is a minimal implementation **on purpose** \-- for example,
gettransaction doesn't return every possible bit of information you might want
to know about a transaction, and will only return information for transactions
in your own wallet. We are trying to think ahead and not add features that
will be broken or taken away when bitcoin supports running in a 'lightweight
client' mode, without access to the entire bitcoin transaction history.  
  
I've updated the API wiki page with the new methods.
