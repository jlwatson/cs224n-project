I can see the GUI not allowing a less-than-CENT to save fat-fingered users
from themselves, but I think the RPC should allow it; at the very least it
makes it possible for a kind of grass-roots movement to arise between miners
and people generating transactions so if we start seeing a lot of transactions
with less-than-CENT-per-kbyte-fees then that's a really good indication the
default definition of "free" needs to change.  
  
And now that the RPC and GUI allow full-precision amounts for send/move, there
is no problem with "I got 50.000001 bitcoins from mining, how do I send ALL of
them?"
