  
How far back in history do you have to go to find a time when the Earth
couldn't support human life?  
  
If I recall correctly, CO2 concentrations were pretty darn high when the
dinosaurs where walking around. There were no people around then, but I don't
see any reason why we couldn't live in a much warmer, wetter world.  
  
You got it backwards. The dinosaurs came after the mass extinction of other
species.  
  
Which is kind of my point: if there IS a mass extinction event, then that
sucks for the species that go extinct. But new species will arise that are
well-adapted to the new climate. And we humans are a pretty darn adaptable
species...
