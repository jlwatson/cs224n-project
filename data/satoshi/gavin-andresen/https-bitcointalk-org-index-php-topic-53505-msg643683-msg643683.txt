  
Sure-- it has to be possible, there is no guarantee that you'll see blocks
announced on the network in order. An orphan block may just be one that you
can't connect to the main chain yet because you haven't seen it's parent yet
(maybe you're downloading blocks and haven't got them all yet, or maybe a
miner got lucky and only needed eleven hashes to build on a block and you see
her block before the parent because of network delays).
