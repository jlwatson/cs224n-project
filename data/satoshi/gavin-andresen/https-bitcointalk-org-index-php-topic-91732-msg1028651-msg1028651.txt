I believe developers underestimate how transaction replacement feature is
important, e.g. utilizing this proposal a business dealing with customers
bitcoins wouldn't be required to hold private keys with a substantial balance
and the Bitcoinica hacks (I stumbled on typing the word "hack" in plural)
wouldn't have such devastating results.

Bottom line: I think transaction replacement is important, but if we just
enable it as-is then I think we open up the entire network to an easy DoS
attack.  
  
And I think the incentives for miners aren't right. I think the rule for what
version of a transaction will be included in blocks has to be something like
"the one that pays miners most OR the one that pays miners first (if there are
several with the same fee)."  
  
So I think a scheme where transaction fees are increased, or lock times are
decreased, with every transaction replacement is the right way to go.
