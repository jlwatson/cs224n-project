IF you have 30% or more hashpower...
... and IF you are willing to sustain the attack and tolerate a much higher orphan rate and lower profits until the difficult changes...
... and IF you can control network connectivity so you're sure just 30% of hashpower gets your bigger block...
... and IF you assume that no other miner is or will try to pull off the same attack...

... then maybe this would work.

That is a lot of ifs.

And if the first two conditions are true, then you could just try to selfish mine with ordinary size blocks. The fact that we don't see selfish mining means either miners can't, or they won't because they take into account meta-incentives of wanting Bitcoin to succeed so they're mining hardware doesn't become worthless.
