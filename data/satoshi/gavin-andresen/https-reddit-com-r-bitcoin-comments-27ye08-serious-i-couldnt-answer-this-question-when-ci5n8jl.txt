Those are very smart, well-informed question.

Theoretically, if Bitcoin becomes a truly global currency it should be more stable than any regional or national currency, because unavoidable negative events in one part of the world (war! famine!) should be balanced out by unavoidable positive events in other parts of the world (peace! freedom!).

Only global unavoidable events should affect stability in that case-- and as economists say, "there ain't no such thing as a free lunch." Clever monetary policy won't save us from a worldwide depression if we're hit by a massive asteroid that causes crop failure all over the world.

As for poorer countries being left behind: maybe you could ask your dad how a country's monetary policy makes poor countries wealthier. Where does that extra wealth come from?

The only answer that makes any sense economically is that somehow monetary policy can make people more productive, but that seems unlikely to be significant to me. Innovation and ease of starting businesses increase productivity a lot; I can't imagine that making exports cheaper (and imports more expensive) by devaluing your national currency has a huge impact on productivity in the long run.

And we certainly have a lot of examples of countries becoming poor (or becoming more poor) by central banks screwing up and hyper-inflating.
