  
You don't seem to have the "jump in and help" mentality needed to participate
in a radically open project like Bitcoin.  
  
As I have said repeatedly in the past: you don't have to ask anybody for
permission or advice. You are part of the process-- make it happen.  
  
Personally, I don't know nuthin about "opfor teams" ... (but am the creator of
the Bitcoin testnet, so am offended by you saying there is no ability or
desire to bring more testing rigor to Bitcoin).
