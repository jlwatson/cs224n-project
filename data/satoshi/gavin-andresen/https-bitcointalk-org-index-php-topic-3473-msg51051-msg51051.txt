Version 0.3.20.01 is now at:  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.20/  
  
Differences with the first release candidate 0.3.20:  
  
\+ Windows built with mingw instead of Visual C++ (my fingers are crossed that
fixes the rendering issue)  
\+ Fix for a denial-of-service attack reported in IRC
