Was there an interim version of accounts on git at some point that had just
("acentry", "account") for the key?  

  
I just browsed back through the git commit history, and I don't see any
interim commits of the account code (I was working in local branches, and
didn't push interim versions up).  
  
davout: You should try dumping your wallet using the latest bitcointools
(dbdump.py --wallet), it will tell you if it finds weird key values in there.
