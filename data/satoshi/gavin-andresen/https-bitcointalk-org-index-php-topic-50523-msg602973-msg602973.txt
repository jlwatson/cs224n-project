It sounds like that arbitrary scripts have been run through the client
software successfully in the past (such as these testnet scripts), but there
hasn't been any rigorous efforts to check that it's robust, etc. I would
volunteer, but I'm not sure how to isolate the ref client scripting engine,
and then still throw in things like OP_CHECKSIG evaluations which require more
than just the script itself (such as the whole Tx and the ECDSA verification
methods).  

  
See src/test/script_test.cpp in git HEAD.  
Or for more examples of testing script operations, the unit tests I wrote
here:
