Great!  
  
  
Unless Mike messed up his implementation of the OP_NOP1 and made it do
something other than be a no-op, there should be no problem (OP_EVAL re-
defines OP_NOP1 to do stuff instead of doing nothing, but all OP_EVAL
transactions are valid if the OP_EVAL is interpreted as a no-op).  
  
  
Publish how? I already made a couple of testnet transactions using OP_EVAL; I
will make a few on main net (assuming Luke doesn't change Eligius to reject
OP_NOP1 transactions). And I wrote thorough unit tests that create
valid/invalid OP_EVAL transactions.  
  
What do you mean by "everytime there's a block change" ?  
  
"OP_EVAL" can be anywhere in the coinbase, I'll probably write a little tool
using bitcointools to look at OP_EVAL adoption over time will make sure it
doesn't care where the string appears.
