Unless I'm a rat after the big block of cheese, in which case I'm probably
smart enough to pass up the small piece sitting on the rat-trap while making
my way to the fridge.  

Yes, but if Bob and Alice keep the 2-of-2 multisig address secret, then you,
the rat, will have no idea that they key you managed to steal is one of the
two keys needed to open the fridge.  
  
That's why I say that sending the change back into the same multisig address
every time is somewhat bad for security...

What does this mean? Does it only mean that client version 0.7 will have
M-of-N signing functionality through its API?

Yes, that was announced before (see the thread about the raw transactions
api).
