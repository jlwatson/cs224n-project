Thanks for the donations, everybody!  
  
Catching up on questions:  
  
Is the faucet supported entirely by donations? Not entirely-- the captchas
have generated about $100, which will go into refilling it. It looks like
captcha revenue is only covering about 1/4 of the cost of the coins, although
the company that does the money-for-captchas is a startup looking for more
advertisers. Actually, if you want to advertise a bitcoin-related business you
should talk to them... (they're adscaptcha.com)  
  
Was somebody abusing the faucet? Yep, somebody was exploiting a weakness in my
IPv6-handling code. I've fixed the weakness (the faucet is now much stricter
about what it considers "different" IPv6 addresses), but I think I'm fighting
a losing battle-- the next step will be to require you to login with a valid
google account to get coins. I hate to add another hoop to jump through...  
  
Is it time to reduce the payout? Maybe soon, but I'd rather wait until the
next release is out and then reduce the payouts another factor of 10 (so
'standard' payout if balance was above 500BTC would be 0.05BTC, and 0.005 when
it was running low).  
  
Can I add a link to bitcoinmonitor.com? Done.
