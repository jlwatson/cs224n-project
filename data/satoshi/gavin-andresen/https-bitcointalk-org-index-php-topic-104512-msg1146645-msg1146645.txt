Disclaimer: I don't do Windows.  
  
But according to a quick google search, caret is the Windows cmd.exe escape
character, and [] and {} are NOT special characters to cmd.exe.  
  
So maybe this?  
  

Code:

bitcoind.exe createrawtransaction
[{^"txid^":^"eb63d5d53cd906b5cf75a014e1bcf1c0198ae58d378d45dbfa15045ac89a38ac^",^"vout^":0}]
{^"1GMaxweLLbo8mdXvnnC19Wt2wigiYUKgEB^":23.35}
