Thinking out loud:  
  
If miners (or other nodes) not relaying transactions starts to become an
issue, "we" could write code to detect and discourage it.  
  
Detecting: the node says it is a full node but you get many fewer 'inv'
messages from it compared to your other peers.  
  
Discouraging: you refuse to relay or build on any new-block messages that you
get from that node.  
  
See https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/tree/discourageblocks for a
framework for the 'discourage' part.
