Transactions won't disappear if they're valid. They'll just move to the longer
block chain.  
  
Invalid transactions would be somebody trying to double-spend across the split
chains (which would be tricky-- you'd have to run a modified client, or copy
your wallet to a machine working on the other block chain).  
  
Or if the split lasted long enough (more than 100 blocks), transactions that
involve generated coins on the shorter chain would be invalid at the merge.  
  
For shorter splits, immature generated coins on the shorter chain will
disappear when the chains merge, but that would be about the worst
consequences for honest users (unless you were unlucky enough to get an
invalid coin from somebody trying to cheat).
