If the mediator generates the script and you use the hash without checking the
script then you would have to fully trust the mediator.  

  
So in an escrow situation all three parties have to exchange public keys and
agree on one particular way of putting them together into a Script that they
all agree on (so they all agree on the Script's hash). That seems OK-- the
three parties have to exchange public keys before creating any transactions in
any case.
