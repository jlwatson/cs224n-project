How would you use a 'getaddressbalance'? What are you trying to do?  
  
Start with an empty wallet. I send you 100 BTC to address 'foo'. Then you send
somebody else 1 BTC.  
  
Internally, a new change address with ~~49~~ (edit: 99) bitcoins is created,
so getaddressbalance 'foo' would return zero. Would that ever be the right
answer?
