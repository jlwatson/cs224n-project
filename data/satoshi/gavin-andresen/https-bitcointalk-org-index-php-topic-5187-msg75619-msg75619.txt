So before deciding to do ClearCoin, I was thinking I was going to clone one or
more of the PayPal shopping cart / payment APIs.  
  
The advantage would that all of the existing shopping cart interfaces that
know how to talk to PayPal would "just work" with bitcoins (the PayPal APIs
can already deal with multiple currencies) -- just replace the
https://api.paypal.com/ URL (or whatever it is) and specify amounts in BTC
instead of USD or EUR.  
  
The short-term business model would be an E-Wallet for businesses (like
PayPal). The medium/long-term business plan would be to get acquired by PayPal
when PayPal decided they need to support bitcoin.  
  
If you don't like PayPal, then replace "PayPal" by "Google Checkout" or
whatever other, popular payment processing gateway API is already being used
by lots of websites.  
  
I still think this is a good idea, but I'm busy, so I'm throwing it out here
and hoping somebody decides to do it.
