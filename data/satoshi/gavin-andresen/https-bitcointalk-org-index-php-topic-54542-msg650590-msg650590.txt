I spent some time today looking again at the state of quantum computing: I'm
still not worried.  
  
The D-Wave system is not a general-purpose quantum computer; it is pretty
specialized for solving certain problems (I'm reasonably certain cracking
ECDSA encryption is not one of the problems it would be good at, but I am
definitely NOT a quantum crypto expert).  
  
Skimming the research, it looks like you'd need a specially-constructed
quantum computer with 515 qbits and over 100million quantum gates, running
more than 16 million quantum operations to crack Bitcoin's 256-bit ECDSA
private keys using Shor's algorithm.  
  
There's was a good reality-check article in the New York Times just last week:  
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/science/scott-aaronson-quantum-computing-
promises-new-insights.html  
  
  
I've said it before: I'll start to worry when quantum computers can factor
64-bit numbers.
