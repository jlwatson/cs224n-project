I spent some time today looking again at the state of quantum computing: I'm
still not worried.  
  
The D-Wave system is not a general-purpose quantum computer; it is pretty
specialized for solving certain problems (I'm reasonably certain cracking
ECDSA encryption is not one of the problems it would be good at, but I am
definitely NOT a quantum crypto expert).  
  
Skimming the research, it looks like you'd need a specially-constructed
quantum computer with 515 qbits and over 100million quantum gates, running
more than 16 million quantum operations to crack Bitcoin's 256-bit ECDSA
private keys using Shor's algorithm.  
  
There's was a good reality-check article in the New York Times just last week:

Unfortunately, while small quantum computations have already been demonstrated
in the lab, they typically fall apart after only a few dozen operations.
Thats why one of the most-celebrated quantum computations to date has been to
factor 15 into 3 times 5  with high statistical confidence! The problem is
decoherence: basically, stray interactions that intrude prematurely on the
computers fragile quantum state, collapsing it like a soufflé. In theory,
it ought to be possible to reduce decoherence to a level where error-
correction techniques could render its remaining effects insignificant. But
experimentalists seem nowhere near that critical level yet.

  
I've said it before: I'll start to worry when quantum computers can factor
64-bit numbers.
