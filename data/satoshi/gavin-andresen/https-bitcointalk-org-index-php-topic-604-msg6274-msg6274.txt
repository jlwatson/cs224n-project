Was that the only thing I broke in the OSX build?! Does it actually work after
just that one change?  

I built a TEST-network bitcoind with the SVN r115 changes merged in, and yes,
after that one change it's been happily generating coins all afternoon.  
I don't use the stock makefile.osx, though-- I setup the dependency directory
structure a little differently (for no really good reason).
