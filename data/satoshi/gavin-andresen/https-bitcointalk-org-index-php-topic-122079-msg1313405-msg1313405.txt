The relevant settings and their default values for recent versions of bitcoind
are:  
  

Code:

Maximum size, in bytes, of blocks you create:  
blockmaxsize=250000  
  
How many bytes of the block should be dedicated to high-priority transactions,  
included regardless of the fees they pay  
blockprioritysize=27000  
  
Minimum block size you want to create; block will be filled with free
transactions  
until there are no more or the block reaches this size:  
blockminsize=0  
  
Fee-per-kilobyte amount (in BTC) considered the same as "free"  
Be careful setting this: if you set it to zero then  
a transaction spammer can cheaply fill blocks using  
1-satoshi-fee transactions. It should be set above the real  
cost to you of processing a transaction.  
mintxfee=0.0005  

  
So if you set blockprioritysize=0, you will only accept fee-paying
transactions.  
  
If you only want to accept 500 or so transactions, set the blocksize to 500 *
average transaction size (400 bytes or so) = 200000  
  
The rules for filling up the block are:  
  
First, take the highest priority transactions (regardless of fee) and fill up
the block to blockprioritysize. (if blockprioritysize is zero, then this step
does not apply)  
  
Then, take the highest fee-per-kilobyte transactions and continue filling the
block until either you run out of transactions with a fee-per-kilobyte greater
than mintxfee or the block would be larger than blockmaxsize.  
  
Finally: the rules are likely to change again fairly soon so that groups of
related transactions are considered together ("child pays for parent", so
customers can send zero-fee transactions to merchants, who can create a child
transaction with a fee when they need the transaction to be confirmed).
