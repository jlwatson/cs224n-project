I split this into it's own thread.  
  
Here's a counter-proposal:  
  
All RPC methods dealing with amounts take and report full-precision bitcoins.  
E.g. if you have 1 BTC getbalance reports 1.00000000 (as it does now)  
The send and move methods will be changed to NOT round to two decimal places.  
  
luke-jr's patch that makes bitcoin avoid creating sub-cent change (when
possible) will be applied.  
  
The GUI will be modified to display full precision amounts, and will allow
full-precision sends.  
(if you have 1 BTC, GUI should show balance: 1.00  
if you have 1.0001 BTC, GUI should show balance: 1.0001  
...etc)  
  
A new setting: maxtxfee will be added, default will be 0.01 BTC. RPC methods
will fail with a new error message if a send/sendfrom would generate a
transaction fee larger than maxtxfee.  
  
A new RPC method to change maxtxfee setting (maybe a generic RPC method to
change any run-time option that can be changed on the fly?)  
  
The code should be checked and all references to CENT which really mean
"minimum transaction fee" should be changed to reference a new "minimum
transaction fee" constant (==CENT for now).
