1\. TxOut scripts are not evaluated until they are spent-- those are probably
unspendable TxOuts.  
  
2\. The inputs must be valid (you're looking at coinbase txns with no inputs
though). Again, TxOuts aren't evaluated until they are used as inputs in
another transaction; as long as they deserialize properly they'll be accepted.  
  
3\. I don't know of any other bugs in the scripts ops, but I don't know that
anybody has written thorough unit tests for them (anybody looking for a good
get-your-feet-wet project that could be a good one to tackle; there are
already unit tests for CHECKMULTISIG in the repostitory....).
