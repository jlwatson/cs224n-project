Bitcoin is revolutionary because it is decentralized, with no single point of
control or failure.  
  
However, over the last six months or so it has become obvious to me that the
rest of the world isn't set up to interact with a radically decentralized
system like Bitcoin, and I think forming a not-for-profit organization will be
a positive step towards Bitcoin's long-term success.  
  
I'm posting this to see if there is a consensus on what a Bitcoin Foundation
should be.  
  
To get the conversation started, here are some functions I think a Bitcoin
Foundation could perform:  
  

  * Interact with the legal system, where a centralized entity is needed: for example, to hold the Bitcoin trademark, own/control the bitcoin.org domain name, etc.  

  * Act as a central library for accurate information about Bitcoin, so journalists and policymakers have an 'official' place to learn about Bitcoin.  

  * Collect donations to fund infrastructure necessary for Bitcoin's growth (organize regular developers' conferences or get-togethers maybe? pay for development of cross-implementation testing tools? pay core developers' salaries? create a certification/testing program for Bitcoin implementations? create a central clearinghouse for information about legal issues surrounding Bitcoin across the world?)  

  
Other not-for-profit organizations that could be emulated:  
  

  * The Anti-Phishing Working Group (the APWG's chairman, David Jevans http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Jevans, is willing to help make a Bitcoin Foundation happen).  

  * The Tor Project  

  * The Apache Software Foundation  

  
Are there others that work well, or are there examples of what NOT to do?
Assuming there is rough consensus that a Bitcoin Foundation is a good idea, I
would like to get something imperfect up and running quickly, with the
expectation that it will evolve over time.
