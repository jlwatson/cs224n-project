They do more than break even-- the most efficient farmers make a small profit. Just enough to keep them from switching to the second-most-profitable activity they could invest in (maybe raising chickens instead of farming).

In theory, at least. The real world is complicated by individual preferences (maybe farmer's wife hates chickens) and irrational biases like the sunk costs fallacy.
