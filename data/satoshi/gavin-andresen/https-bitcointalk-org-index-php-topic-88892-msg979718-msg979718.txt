In the 0.6.3 thread Graet asks a good question: what's do we mean by
"critical" versus "serious" vulnerability?  
  
Here's what those terms mean to me. All examples are hypothetical:  
  
A critical vulnerability is one that will have disastrous consequences if it
is exploited. Examples might be a remote code exploit, a bug that somebody
could use to take down the entire bitcoin network, or a bug that could be
exploited to steal your entire wallet.  
  
A serious vulnerability is one that will have serious consequences if it is
exploited. Examples might be a bug that can be triggered by network traffic
and will cause the software to stop working or a bug that could be exploited
to misdirect your next bitcoin transaction so it goes to an attacker instead
of the intended recipient.  
  
The 0.6.3 denial-of-service problem I consider "serious" -- an attacker who
figures out exactly what the vulnerability is (we haven't disclosed that yet)
can make bitcoind or Bitcoin-Qt stop processing transactions.  
  
Then there are run-of-the-mill vulnerabilities; things like Sybil attacks that
require an attacker to round up hundreds or thousands of machines, or denial-
of-service attacks that require that the attacker be able to send the victim
gigabytes of network traffic. Dealing with these often doesn't even merit a
mention in the release notes, because they affect so few people and require an
attacker willing to spend a fair bit of money and/or effort just to be
annoying.
