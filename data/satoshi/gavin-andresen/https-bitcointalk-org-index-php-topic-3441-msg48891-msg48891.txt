There are no incentives for doing that. If 98% of the network "discourages" a
block, then those miners have a small chance of losing their blocks to the 2%
that does not discourage the block. However, not discouraging a block has no
penalty at all.  

  
Excellent point. Although there should be a meta-incentive to make the bitcoin
system successful, so there are lots of transactions (and lots of transaction
fees for the miners). Certainly big payment clearing houses that want instant
payments to work have the right incentives...
