From the arimaa whitepaper:

Although there can be multiple registrars to choose from an individual  
or organization can maintain only one effective account with only one
registrar.

Right-- good luck with that! Any system that relies on Wise, Efficient and
Effective Bureaucracies to decide hard questions like "are these 400 accounts
really one scammer trying to get more than their fair share" are doomed to
fail if they ever get large enough to attract the attention of scammers.  
  
If you have a really good automated way of telling the scammers from real
people that doesn't require them sending in a DNA sample or body part, please
let me know. I could use a good solution for the Bitcoin Faucet.
