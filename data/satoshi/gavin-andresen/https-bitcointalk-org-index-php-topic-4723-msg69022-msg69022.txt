Making IsStandard() return true if fTestNet is a good idea.  
  
The process for getting a new transaction type into bitcoin would be to test
it thoroughly on the testnet, get general consensus on its API and/or GUI and
that it is useful, safe, and unlikely to be abused, and work with the
'infrastucture' sites (like blockexplorer and bitcoinmonitor) to make sure the
right APIs or hooks are in place so they can do something intelligent with the
new transactions.
