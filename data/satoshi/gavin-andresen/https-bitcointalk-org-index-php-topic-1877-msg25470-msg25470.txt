@Gavin: I don't see the sense of a Bitcoin MIME type. A URI scheme describes a
_resource_. A MIME type binds a _document type_ to a handler. Implementing a
"click to send Bitcoins" capability using a MIME type would require that the
website on which the payment link was embedded send a new document to the
client browser. Seems needlessly complicated to me.  

From the previous thread:

But a bitcoin: URI has problems, too:  
1\. It is hard to implement-- every browser has a different way of registering
protocol handlers.  
2\. If you don't have the protocol handler installed, clicking on the link
doesn't give you any help on what to do to make it work. (try it here)  
3\. Looks like some software (like this forum) don't like bitcoin URIs: Donate
to the Faucet (that URI is bitcoin:15VjRaDX9zpbA8LVnbrCAFzrVzN7ixHNsC, the
forum software is truncating it and adding http://).  

  
Implementing something that won't even work on our own forums would be a bad
idea, in my humble opinion.
