RE: 25 outbound connections instead of 8:  
  
If I recall correctly (and I probably don't), the percentage of nodes
currently on the network that are accepting incoming connections and the
-maxconnections limit isn't great enough to support every node trying to make
25 outbound connections.  
  
The major merchants and exchanges should accept incoming connections, so they
have many more than 8 connections. That will make them basically immune to
Sybil attacks (e.g. the Faucet has 55 connections right now).  
  
I like the idea of major merchants and exchanges (also) communicating with
each other over an invitation-only, trusted "backbone." That would be in
addition to the mostly-randomly-connected p2p network we have now, not instead
of it.  
  
I'm concerned about Sybil attacks as a denial-of-service technique (attacker
"surrounds" an 8-connection node and then drops all of their transactions just
because they can). Randomly disconnecting and re-connecting seems like a good
approach.  
  
Detecting that you're being subjected to a Sybil attack seems like it might
also be a good approach. You don't really care if you're seeing a bogus
version of the block chain unless you're in the middle of confirming one or
more transactions; perhaps if transaction confirmation is taking significantly
longer than expected the client should find some fresh peers.
