Thanks! I'll add the donation address to the bottom of the page.  
  
I'm thinking of keeping the donation address the same, so donations to the
Faucet are transparent to anybody who wants to see. I WANT donations to, and
payments from, the Bitcoin Faucet to be NON-anonymous, so anybody can audit
that address and see the flow of bitcoins through the Faucet.  
  
(by the way, if anybody is looking for an interesting bitcoin-related coding
project I think a website where you enter a Bitcoin address and it shows you a
visualization of all the transactions that went to/from that address would be
cool... extra credit if it let you browse the web of transactions... I'd be
really curious to see what percentage of bitcoins withdrawn from the Faucet
end up donated right back into it...)
