Satoshi Nakamoto writes in his white paper that it is not needed to control
all of the bitcoin connections, but just a majority of them. Am I missing
something ?  

  
You are confusing "control 50+% of generating power" with "control
connections."  
  
Lets say you control 51% of the generating power.  
  
You can:  
  
Spend bitcoins once. Then wait for them to be confirmed by the rest of the
network as many times as the merchant requires, while secretly working on
another version of the block chain where you did NOT spend them. Your secret
block chain should be longer than the network's, since you control 51% of the
generating power.  
  
So you announce your secret block chain, and instead of sending those coins to
a merchant you include a transaction where you send them to yourself. YEAH!
you just ripped off the merchant! Wahoo!  
  
You cannot rip off two merchants with the same bitcoins-- one or the other of
the transactions will be seen as valid.  
  
And you cannot "unspend" the transaction to the merchant-- if you don't spend
it SOMEWHERE, the merchant's bitcoin node will re-announce it to the network
and all the other nodes will consider those bitcoins "spent, just waiting to
be included in the next generated block."  
  
  
If you run the numbers again with the realistic double-spend scenario, you'll
see crime doesn't pay. There is no way you can rent enough hashing power to
commit a profitable double-spend attack.  
  
If you can steal the hashing power (maybe you're a bot farmer), then if you
run the numbers you'll find it is more profitable to just generate blocks and
sell the bitcoins rather than try to somehow get stuff trying to double-spend.
