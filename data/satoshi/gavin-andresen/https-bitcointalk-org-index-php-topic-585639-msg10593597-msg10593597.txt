... I managed to be wrong twice: I forgot about the AreInputsStandard check
for P2SH transactions that makes any transaction with more than 15 signature
operations non-standard.  
  
So if you REALLY need a m-of-16-to-20 transaction, use a non-standard raw
CHECKMULTISIG, don't bother with Script gymnastics to try to workaround the
520-byte push limit.
