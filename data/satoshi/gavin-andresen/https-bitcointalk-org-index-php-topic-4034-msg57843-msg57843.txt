  
I've got a (private so far) patch that creates mass-pay transactions. API is:  
sendmulti <fromaccount> {address:amount,...} [minconf=1] [comment]  
  
This code in CTransaction::AcceptToMemoryPool will need to change, too:  

Code:

if (GetSigOpCount() > 2 || nSize < 100)  
return error("AcceptToMemoryPool() : nonstandard transaction");

(a mass-pay transaction will have N+1 OP_CHECKSIGs in it, where N is the
number of people being paid).  
  
Replacing in the stock client with something like:  

Code:

if (GetSigOpCount() > 2) minFee += GetSigOpCount()*GetArgMoney("-masspayfee",
CENT/100);

... seems like the right direction to go.  
  
BUT: I think a higher priority is figuring out how to deal with fees for the
other two send methods.
