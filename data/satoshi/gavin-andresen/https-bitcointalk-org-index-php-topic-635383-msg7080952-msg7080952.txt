A future release will automagically figure out the right fee (or will figure
out it doesn't need a fee) to get into a block quickly (or slowly, if you want
to pay lower fees and are willing to wait).  
  
As for your original question: set the -paytxfee command-line option for
current Core releases and you WILL always pay a fee.
