Do we have definitive answer that ClearCoin is not for sale?  

Several people have asked me about buying it, but I won't sell it unless I
trust that the team that takes it on has experience keeping customer's money
safe and the resources to do all of the things I don't have time for--
penetration testing, better customer support, insurance on the coins in
escrow, etc.
