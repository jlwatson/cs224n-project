I don't see the security risk of being able to intercept or eavesdrop on a
Bitcoin transfer.  
  
All transactions are broadcast to all Bitcoin generating nodes, anyway, and
the transactions are impossible to alter or forge (because they're digitally
signed).  
  
A man-in-the-middle could drop the transaction, but SSL doesn't fix that-- if
they're relaying SSL traffic they could drop your SSL-encrypted transaction,
too.  
  
There are good non-security-related reasons for encrypting Bitcoin transaction
traffic, though (makes it harder for governments/ISPs to do deep packet
inspection to selectively drop Bitcoin traffic, for example).
