It's not just an issue with proxies. Since there's no authentication, any "man
in the middle" can intercept your BitCoin transfer, including your ISP and
other people on your wireless connection. It's like logging into your bank's
website without HTTPS.  

I don't see the security risk of being able to intercept or eavesdrop on a
Bitcoin transfer.  
  
All transactions are broadcast to all Bitcoin generating nodes, anyway, and
the transactions are impossible to alter or forge (because they're digitally
signed).  
  
A man-in-the-middle could drop the transaction, but SSL doesn't fix that-- if
they're relaying SSL traffic they could drop your SSL-encrypted transaction,
too.  
  
There are good non-security-related reasons for encrypting Bitcoin transaction
traffic, though (makes it harder for governments/ISPs to do deep packet
inspection to selectively drop Bitcoin traffic, for example).
