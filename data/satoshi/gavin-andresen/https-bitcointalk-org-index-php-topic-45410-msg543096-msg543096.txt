Previous versions of bitcoin are unable to read encrypted wallets,  
and will crash on startup if the wallet is encrypted.  

Is it a notification or a real crash?  

  
A real crash.  
  
In a perfect world, Bitcoin version 0.1 would have included code that looked
for a "Bitcoin version X or later required to read this wallet.dat file"
setting, and notify the user and exit cleanly if X is greater than the version
you're running.  
  
We don't live in a perfect world.  
  
So the second-best solution was to have version 0.4 and later do the "Bitcoin
version X or later required to read this wallet.dat file" thing. And write a
value into the wallet that causes previous versions of bitcoin to crash on
startup.  
  
If previous versions didn't crash when given an encrypted wallet, they'd just
ignore the encrypted keys, generate a bunch of new, unencrypted keys, and give
people heart attacks when they ran the old version of bitcoin and told them
they had a 0 bitcoin balance.
