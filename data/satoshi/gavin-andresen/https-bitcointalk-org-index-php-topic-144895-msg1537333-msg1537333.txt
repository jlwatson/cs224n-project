RE: lots of code to write if you can't keep up with transaction volume: sure.
So?

Transaction volume itself leads to centralization too, simply by ensuring that
only a miner able to keep up with the large volume of low-fee transactions can
make a profit.  

  
I really don't understand this logic.  
  
Yes, it is a fact of life that if you have a system where people are
competing, the people who are less efficient will be driven out of business.
So there will be fewer people in that business.  
  
You seem to be saying that we should subsidize inefficient miners by limiting
the block size, therefore driving up fees and making users pay for their
inefficiency.  
  
All in the name of vague worries about "too much centralization."
