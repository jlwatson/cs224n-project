Whatever mechanism is chosen, it had better not significantly slow down the
network or client unless strong anonymity is required/requested.  
  
I've tried I2P and Tor, and, for me, super-strong privacy isn't worth the
performance cost.  
  
Also, regarding forking the block chain by a network split:  
  
It's only "really bad" if I can get away with double-spending some coins
before the network merges again.  
If I'm buying valuable stuff, then the merchants will likely require 6
confirmations before releasing the goods, so I'd have to be able to keep the
network split for an hour or more.  
  
Merchants will likely have very-well-connected, long-running nodes. For
example, the Bitcoin Faucet has 66 connections right now. If I wanted to try
to implement a "fork the block chain attack" I'd have to somehow manage to
insert my "cancer nodes" in between two merchants that I want to rip off (I'll
end up ripping off one of the two, because eventually one of the two double-
spend transactions will "win").  
  
I don't know enough about network analysis to figure out how many cancer nodes
you'd need to have a significant chance of getting in between two merchants
with 60+ connections in a network of (say) 1,000 non-cancerous nodes, but I
bet it is a very large number.
