Well, right now nothing stops someone from creating a system where:  
  
A sends 1.00000001 to B  
B sends 1.00000000 back to A  
  
Net result is a micro-payment and no processing fee.  

  
... unless B started with zero bitcoins. Then B is stuck; she can't send 1.0
back, because doing that would cause a 0.00000001 bitcoin 'change'
transaction, which would trigger the 0.01BTC fee, which they can't pay
(because they only have 1.0000000001).
