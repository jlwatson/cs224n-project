Successful technology companies do not waste their time solving problems that
they THINK they MIGHT have in 20 years.  
  
They don't even spend much time thinking about problems that they might have
in four years.  
  
I don't spend any time worrying about the strength of 256-bit ECDSA or 160-bit
RIPEMD, and I spend even less time worrying about the strength of those two
combined.
