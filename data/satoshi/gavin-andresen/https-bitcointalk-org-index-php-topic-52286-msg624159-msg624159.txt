Does anyone here believe this? Are people who believe this also opposed to
subsidies for bitcoin businesses?  

Why limit it to bitcoin businesses?  
  
Somebody should create a website where you can get a few bitcoins for free, to
subsidize adoption.

You mean give a significant amount of bitcoins to the 'important' businesses?  
  
Who decides which are 'important' ?  
  
How do you make sure somebody isn't creating fake businesses just to get free
bitcoins ?  
  
If you want to subsidize bitcoin businesses and have answers to those
questions, then I heartily encourage you to go for it!
