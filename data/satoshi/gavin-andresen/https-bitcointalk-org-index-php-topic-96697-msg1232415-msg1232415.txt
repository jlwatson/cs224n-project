Well, on that note, it would be wise if the development team were to consider
the adoption of a second address schema using a different public/private algo.  

Right now? What if we did that and it turned out the second public/private
algo was broken first? ECDSA is a NIST standard that has been very well
studied and has no known vulnerabilities. There are much, much, much higher
items on the development TODO list, like figuring out a nice GUI for multi-
device transaction authorization.  
  
I did write up plans for migrating to a new algorithm here:

signature algorithm" example at the end).
