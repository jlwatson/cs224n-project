But a new signature type is exactly what segwit does-- see BIP143.

And you don't have to stuff things into P2SH, you can use the payment protocol to request payment directly to a segwit transaction where there is just either 21 or 33 bytes in the scriptPubKey -- just the hash of the public key.

I'm still not seeing your simpler solution for malleability.  Maybe if you wrote a patch....
