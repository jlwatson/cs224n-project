But when I'm composing an email I have no idea whether or not it will be rejected as "too big" by whatever SMTP server handles delivery.

And yet... email seems to work just fine.

That is very similar to miners composing blocks and then hoping the "consensus server" that is the rest of the network accepts them.

Not exactly the same, but similar. And before you read more into that: yes, it is reasonable for a protocol to be designed so that miners don't have to do much guessing...
