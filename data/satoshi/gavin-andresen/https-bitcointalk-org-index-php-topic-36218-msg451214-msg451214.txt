So... I got this unsolicited email:  
  
  
... and I'm trying to figure out why my immediate reaction is "yuck."  
  
I guess I just don't see the point of IxCoin. I just spent some time looking
back through all the original poster's messages, and I don't see any prior
discussion of goals of IxCoin, how it should be designed, etc.  
  
If the goal is to let more people be early adopters of a new cyber-currency,
then it seems to me giving early bitcoin adopters a bunch of IxCoin goes
against that goal.
