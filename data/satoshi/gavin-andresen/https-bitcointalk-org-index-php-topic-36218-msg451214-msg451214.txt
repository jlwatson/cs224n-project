Hi Gavin,  
  
I'm one of the founders of the Ixcoin fork of Bitcoin. If you're  
interested in trying out the new blockchain, we set aside a 5,000 IXC  
bonus for each of you.  
  
Please email me your IXC addresses if you're interested.  
  
Best regards,  
  
Thomas.

... and I'm trying to figure out why my immediate reaction is "yuck."  
  
I guess I just don't see the point of IxCoin. I just spent some time looking
back through all the original poster's messages, and I don't see any prior
discussion of goals of IxCoin, how it should be designed, etc.  
  
If the goal is to let more people be early adopters of a new cyber-currency,
then it seems to me giving early bitcoin adopters a bunch of IxCoin goes
against that goal.
