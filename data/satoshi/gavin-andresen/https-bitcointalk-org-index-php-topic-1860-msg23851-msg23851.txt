As a veteran of the premature standardization trenches (I wrote most of the
ISO/IEC 14772-1 "VRML97" specification before I changed my last name from
"Bell" to "Andresen")... I agree with foreverdamaged. It is too early to try
to create a formal specification.  
  
However, it think writing informal specifications documenting how bitcoin
works right now is a great idea, and will be really helpful when it **is**
time to go through some standardization process.
