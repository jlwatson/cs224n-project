What error did you get, farmer_boy? The only errors I see in the server's logs
are "rate limit" errors.  
  
The Faucet tries hard to prevent people from cheating and using it more than
once; unfortunately, that means if somebody who "looks like you" uses the
Faucet before you, you might be prevented from getting your coins. If that
happens, try again a day later.  
  
I've been thinking about implementing a two-tiered Faucet: one that gives out
a smaller number of coins and just requires you solve the CAPTCHA (and has all
the current anti-cheating measures in place; there **are** one or two people
still people cheating, but they're only able to get a few bit-pennies an hour,
and they're going through an amazing amount of trouble to do it).  
  
And another that gives out a larger number of coins if you login with a valid
Google account. Getting tens or hundreds of Google accounts is harder than
solving CAPTCHAS.  
  
But if I did do that... I'd get accused of implementing the Faucet as a sneaky
way of stealing Google account email addresses.  
  
Sigh.
