Once upon a time bitcoin.org called Bitcoin "anonymous" but that was a
mistake, and for at least two years "we" (core developers) have tried to be
careful to say that, at best, Bitcoin is pseudanonymous.  
  
I tell reporters that Bitcoin is more private than using any other online
payment method, but less private than cash (unless you know a lot about how it
works under the covers and jump through several hoops to keep your identity
secret).
