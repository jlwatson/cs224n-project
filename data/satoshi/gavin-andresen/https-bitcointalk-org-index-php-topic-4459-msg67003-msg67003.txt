  
... I think that's right, you don't need the OP_OVER OP_ADD. You have to know
the random number to generate a valid signature, given only its hash.  
  
You'd have to be very careful NEVER to use the same random number anybody else
has ever used or will ever use; if your 'random' number is an order number (or
even common-hash-of-an-order-number) then you're sunk, anybody can generate a
valid <signature> <public_key> <r> triple.  
  
For two extra bytes per transaction it might be better to hash in the public
key, just so people don't shoot themselves in the foot.
