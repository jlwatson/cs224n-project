0.7rc1 was running perfectly fine on Windows 7 for the past couple weeks. Just
installed rc2 and it freezes on the splash screen where it says loading block
index.  
....  
Edit: Eventually it does open. But it never used to say "Program is not
responding" during the startup phase before.  

Anybody else having success or failure running rc2 on Windows 7, please let us
know...
