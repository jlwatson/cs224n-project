So...  
  
I've been mostly quiet about the alternative block chains, but I have to say
I'm a little disappointed.  
  
I had hoped that they would be full of interesting experiments with different
transaction types or smart contracts or different fee-setting algorithms or
maybe some innovative scheme for instant transactions.  
  
Instead, it seems like you've been too busy dealing with low hashrates and
transaction-spam attacks, and have been spending all of your time re-inventing
a lot of infrastructure (exchanges and block explorers and mining pool
software and etc.).  
  
I'm curious to hear what other people think: will altchain innovation pick up
in 2012? Am I irrationally biased and just not seeing the awesome power of
(insert-your-favorite-altchain-feature-here)?  
  
I think there's an interesting dynamic, where the larger and more popular an
altchain gets, the harder it is to do things like schedule a block-chain
splitting-change (because you have to get all your exchanges and mining pools
and etc. to upgrade). I wonder if that means the experimentation will only
happen with brand-new blockchains, and if a blockchain will only really take
off it the inventor manages to "get it 99% right" the very first time...
