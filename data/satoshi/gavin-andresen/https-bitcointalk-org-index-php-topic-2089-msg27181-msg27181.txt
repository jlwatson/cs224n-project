I archived my wallet to be opened 16 years from now. Will I run into a similar
problem?  

  
Peer into my crystal ball with me as we predict the future....  
  
No, seriously, upward compatibility (reading old wallet.dat's into new
versions of bitcoin) shouldn't be an issue.  
  
And Satoshi and I are discussing possible fixes for the
upgrade/downgrade/upgrade scenario that we think is causing this.
