I think the technology is still too young to market to 'the mainstream.' What would you tell a mainstream potential bitcoiner to do to get bitcoin? Open a Coinbase account? Use localbitcoins.com (after setting up which wallet?)

A generic, vague 'got BTC' marketing campaign is a huge waste of money until consumers can buy BTC in the grocery store next to the milk.

At this point I think market research and marketing should be done by companies trying to solve real problems and find the niche markets where bitcoin will succeed first.
