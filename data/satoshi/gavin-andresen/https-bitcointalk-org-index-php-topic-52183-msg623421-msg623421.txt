I accidentally sent some bitcoins to a testnet address from MtGOX.  

  
First: sounds like a bug in Mt Gox's bitcoin address validation code that they
should fix.  
  
Second: Do you own the testnet wallet with that address in it? If you do, then
it is possible to transfer the public/private keypair from your testnet wallet
to your main wallet and recover the coins (but you'll need to use PyWallet or
one of sipa's export/import private keys bitcoin branches).  
  
Because the coins are recoverable, you shouldn't expect Mt. Gox to refund the
transaction... (otherwise everybody could create testnet versions of their
main-net bitcoin addresses, withdraw, and then as Mt Gox to "refund" their
"mistake")
