Thanks, Greg!

For the record: some of the EFF coins were distributed through the Faucet, some compensated miners for lost revenue in the March 2013 fork, and the rest were donated back to the EFF when they started accepting Bitcoin again.

I lost some Bitcoin in MyBitcoin.

And I wound down ClearCoin responsibly; all escrows completed cleanly and nobody lost anything (I suppose I lost all those hours I spent working on it, because it was not profitable).
