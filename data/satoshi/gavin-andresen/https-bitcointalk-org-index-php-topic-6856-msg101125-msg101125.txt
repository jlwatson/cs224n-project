Uhhh... maybe a specific example will help. Lets say you start with
accounts/balances of:  
  
A: 5  
B: 5  
"": 1  
Total wallet balance: 11  
  
Now you send 5 BTC from A, and pay a 0.01BTC fee. Account balances will be:  
  
A: -0.01 BTC  
B: 5  
"": 1  
Total wallet balance: 5.99  
  
The fee isn't 'taken' from either B or "". You'll have to decide how to handle
fees; for ClearCoin, I keep a positive balance in the "" account and
automatically move coins from there if a transaction results in a fee (so for
the above case, 0.01 bitcoins would be moved from the "" account to A, so A
ended up with a zero balance and the fee is paid from "").
