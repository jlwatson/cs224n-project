I should talk with Valve?  
  
I'm not an expert in video game economics, and I haven't yet seen a strong
argument for why a game company would give up control of their own in-game
currencies for a currency that they do not (and cannot) control.  
  
If you've got a strong argument for why they should, then **YOU** should talk
with Valve*. They're rational and profit-driven, so if it is in their best
interest they should be willing to do it.
