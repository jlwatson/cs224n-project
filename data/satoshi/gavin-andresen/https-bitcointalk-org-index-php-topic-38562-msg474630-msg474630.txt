If you need a stable testing environment, the self-contained testnet-in-a-box
works very nicely:  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/testnet-in-a-box/  
  
You do have to remember to run -noirc or keep your testnet listen port closed,
because if a 'real' testnet node connects to you you'll get the 'real' testnet
block-chain.
