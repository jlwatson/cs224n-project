I've been trying to imagine a vout containing objects with addresses that the
payer can't use, and I think the only way for that to happen is for the payer
to create it, but even then, the ability to create it requires that he have
the private keys for all the addresses, right?  

  
No. It is perfectly possible for multiple people to provide inputs to a
transaction, each signing their input but without knowledge of the other
people's keys.  
  
That is extremely rare now, but that is exactly what you would do to implement
a peer-to-peer coin-mixing service, which I suspect may be a very popular way
of paying for things since it increases your privacy significantly.
