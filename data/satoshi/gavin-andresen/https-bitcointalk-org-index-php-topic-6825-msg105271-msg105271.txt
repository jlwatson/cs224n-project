When you go to the bank and get your CD-R and set the wallet up again, all
your bitcoins that you sent to that wallet will magically appear.  

you have to use _-rescan_ for the magic to work, though, afaik.  

  
Bitcoin 0.3.21 puts a 'bestblock' entry in the wallet so it will automatically
-rescan if you restore an old wallet (and it only rescans the blocks necessary
to get up-to-date).
