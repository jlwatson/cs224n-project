Actually, the "label" mechanism gives me what I need to keep the freebitcoins
separate from other bitcoins in my server's wallet.  
  
What I'd really like is to store wallets outside of the bitcoin program. I'd
like bitcoind to have these features:  
\+ Generate a new address, but don't store it in the local wallet file--
return the address and private key  
\+ Accept a transaction that is already signed; check that it is new/valid,
and, if it is, broadcast. (if not, reject it)  
\+ Let me register a Bitcoin address that I'm interested in, and when it sees
payments to that address 'tickle' a URL with details on that transaction.  
  
Or, in other words, allow it to function as just a payment gateway.
