  
Yes, of course. I did most of my testing on 'testnet-in-a-box' nodes, but
spent a day producing P2SH blocks and transactions on testnet; see, for
example this transaction that spends a P2SH transaction:

Today I created a smart 'transaction fuzzer', and tomorrow I'll be creating
and running stress-tests for the new p2sh and multisignature code to try to
catch anything code review and unit tests might have missed.
