Even on my Korean windows it shows English. So wtf@that  

  
Nobody has written a Korean translation. If/when somebody does (join
https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/bitcoin/ if you want to help) you'd get
the Korean translation.  
  
An option to change the language in the GUI is a great idea. Somebody should
do that....
