  
There's one tricky accounts-related bug that I think needs to get fixed before
the next release:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues#issue/25  
  
The only other possibly critical bug is:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/#issue/28  
  
... although I haven't been able to reproduce it, even running bitcoind on top
of the 'valgrind' memory checker.  
  
I plan to pull patches into the integration git branch early next week, and
I'll ask for help testing the result.
