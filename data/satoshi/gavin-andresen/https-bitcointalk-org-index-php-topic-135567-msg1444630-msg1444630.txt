Btw, don't 0.3.24 support timestamps in the logfile?  

  
I think you're right, 0.3.24 does not support -logtimestamps. If I recall
correctly, it does log the time at startup; for this particular test, I'm
mostly interested in how long the upgrade process takes, so the old version
not supporting timestamps isn't a problem.
