Once the details are hammered out and there's a testnet implementation (which
I see little reason *not* to rush; it's only testnet), then it'll be time to
summon as much security-researcher attention to it as possible.  

  
I agree. Security is really high on the priority list; I'd like to see secured
bitcoin addresses in people's forum signatures within a year. I'm sure one of
the alternate blockchains will take this idea and run with it, so much of the
hammering-out will happen there.
