I'd say the short answer to "is it possible to accept them again in the near
future" is no (where "near" is in the next six months).  
  
I agree with Maged-- before enabling new opcodes, I'd like to see a peer-
reviewed academic-style paper that works through the security implications of
the existing set of opcodes and gives a nice framework for thinking about new
(or disabled old) opcodes. Doing that is way outside my own personal level of
expertise; I know only enough about designing secure algorithms to know that I
have no idea whether or not re-enabling OP_XOR would have security
implications for bitcoin.  
  
Same goes for enabling nLockTime / transaction replacement, although I suspect
that proving that transaction replacement doesn't open up any subtle attacks
may be harder than proving security properties of opcodes.
