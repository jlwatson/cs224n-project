Yes, if they have an infinite amount of money to pay in transaction fees.  
  
I'm not sure why governments would want to give all of their money to miners,
though. And buying up bitcoins to pay all those fees would just push up the
price, so it would probably be counter-productive as a way of trying to ddos
the network.
