I reformatted... I backed up my bitcoin directory... but when I restored it on
the fresh OS my wallet was not intact...  

  
Are you missing your wallet.dat file or is it damaged?  
  
If it is missing, then grondilu's advice is the best anybody can do.  
If it is damaged, then it might be possible to extract the private keys from
it.  
  
This type of thing is why off-site backups are a really good idea...
