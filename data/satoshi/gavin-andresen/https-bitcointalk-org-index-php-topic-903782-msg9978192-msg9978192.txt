RE: "The Board appears to have not settled on an exact date":  
  
Settled 11 days ago; see https://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org/elections-update/
for the exact dates for the two individual seats.  
  
The election dates for the 'affiliate member seat' isn't yet set, the process
for affiliate organizations to nominate and then cast their votes is still
being worked out (and you don't need to care, unless you are part of the
leadership of one of the Foundation's affiliate organizations and need to
figure out how you and your members will come to consensus on how to vote).
