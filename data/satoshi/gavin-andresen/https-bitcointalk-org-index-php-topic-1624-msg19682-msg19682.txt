Ok, looks like two problems-- if rpcallowip=* works, then maybe bitcoin thinks
your IP is something else (or maybe there is a bug in the bitcoin rpcallowip
code). Run this on the web server:  

Code:

curl http://www.whatismyip.com/automation/n09230945.asp

  
As to why the PHP code isn't working-- can you turn on error_reporting and get
more information on what isn't working?
