How much is it giving right now? If it's still 0.02 BTC (~ 40 cents), that's
probably a bit too much and should be lowered.  
I would be willing to donate to fill it a bit after this is explained (please
join me and donate as well).  

  
40 cents per visitor is definitely too much; I've set the Faucet to "down for
maintenance" again, and will keep it that way until two things happen:  
  
1\. I change the amount awarded.  
and  
2\. bitcoin version 0.3.23 is released with lowered fees, so people can
actually SPEND the bitcoins they get from the faucet.
