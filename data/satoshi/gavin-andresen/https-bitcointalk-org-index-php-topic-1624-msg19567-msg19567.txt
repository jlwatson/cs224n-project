If bitcoin thinks the connection is not allowed, then it just ignores the
connection attempt-- nothing is written to debug.log. That's probably the
right thing to do-- otherwise somebody malicious could try to fill up your
hard disk by repeatedly attempting to connect to port 8332.  
  
If you can recompile bitcoind, the "ClientAllowed" routine in rpc.cpp is where
a printf() to log connections could go. But I'd guess either you misspelled
"rpcallowip" (I always type rcp instead of rpc...) or have a firewall blocking
connections.  
  
If you can ssh into the web server machine (or any other machine, actually),
try:  
curl http://machine_or_ip:8332/  
  
If you get "couldn't connect to host" then it is a firewall problem.  
If you get "Empty reply from server" then it is an rpcallowip problem.  
If you get an HTTP "Authorization Required" or "Authorization Failed" reply,
then it is a username/password mismatch (those ARE logged in debug.log,
though-- grep for ThreadRPC).
