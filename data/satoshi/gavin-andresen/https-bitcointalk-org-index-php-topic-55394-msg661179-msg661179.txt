  
Yes.  
  
The times the blocks are announced also matters; if my node suddenly sees a
longer 10-block chain it has never seen before, then either it is a 51% attack
or the network was split and just came back together.  
  
If the network was split 10 blocks ago then I should see that those 10 blocks
took twice as long to create as expected.  
  
Rating blocks is a neat idea; I can think of several potential criteria, there
are probably more we could come up with:  
  

  * Did I first see the block announcement long after the block's timestamp?
  * Does it look like it is part of a network split? (two chains that are both producing blocks more slowly than usual)
  * Are they part of a sub-chain with a 'normal' distribution of blocks from the well-known mining pools? (an attacker's chain won't have blocks from ANY of the mining pools)
  * Does it contain any double-spends that conflict with alternate chains I know about?
  * Do the transactions in it look 'normal'? (reasonable number of transactions, reasonable amounts)

  
Somebody should simulate some 51% attacks and network splits and try out
various detection algorithms.  
  
And maybe see if it would be practical to have a checkpoint lock-in rule of
something like "auto-checkpoint any AAA-rated block once it is 4-deep in the
best chain". I don't think that should be built-in to bitcoind, but a little
side program that monitored the block chain and the pools and told bitcoind to
add a checkpoint once an hour or so would be pretty spiffy...
