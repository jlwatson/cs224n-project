The bitcoind sendmany RPC call uses destination addresses as JSON Object keys,
so you can't send to the same address multiple times in one transaction.  
  
If you REALLY want to do that... first, why do you want to do that? I suppose
if you want to use the blockchain as a messaging system then sending
0.123+0.567+etc might be an inefficient way of sending a message... but please
don't do that.  
  
Anyway, if you do REALLY want to do that, you'll have to write code to
construct the transaction yourself. Then you could pass it to the
signrawtransaction/sendrawtransaction RPC methods to broadcast it. (you can't
use createrawtransaction to create it, because it uses the same JSON syntax as
sendmany for destination outputs).
