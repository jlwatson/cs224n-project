As I told Matthew when I spoke with him a couple of weeks ago, I also think
this is a fantastic idea and plan on helping the CLAG however I can. Legal and
regulatory uncertainty is perhaps the biggest barrier for companies who might
be thinking of launching projects involving Bitcoin, and having a reliable
source of up-to-date accurate information about the issues will be incredibly
valuable.  
  
Hopefully in a couple of years the CLAG's biggest problem will be figuring out
what it's role should be as similar groups, inspired by the CLAG, spring up
all over the world to tackle the unique legal issues in each country.
