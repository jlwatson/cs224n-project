At first glance, adapting the scheme to ECDSA should not be troublesome but
implementing it is likely to involve a substantial amount of work. It is,
however, vastly simpler than trying to do it using a generic MPC scheme.  

Zero-knowledge proofs... ummm....  
  
Nice to know it _can_ be done securely. I'll leave it to the professionals to
actually do it.
