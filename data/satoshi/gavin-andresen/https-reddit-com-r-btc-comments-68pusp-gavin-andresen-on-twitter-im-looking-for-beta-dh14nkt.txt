Don't send bytes you're going to use for something else. Random generators produce an infinite stream of bytes, so that isn't a problem.

If you use a REALLY bad RNG then 64 bytes of output might be enough to predict future output.

Don't use a really bad RNG.

See for my thought on whether trying to detect people using non-crypto-secure RNGS is worthwhile.
