I am really paranoid about leakage, and for me to even touch a float when
dealing with people's money is unacceptable. On Britcoin, there's a whole
system of balances and checks at every stage of the various transactions to
ensure consistency to all decimal places, and I would not want to throw a
spanner in the works because of a tiny rounding error (which would throw up
flags and warnings everywhere). Even hearing the words round(...) is like
heresy.  

  
Am I the only person here who looks at our documentation for how to use
bitcoin from PHP and thinks "people are going to run away screaming" ? See:
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_(JSON-RPC)  
  
I **strongly** believe you are making the common cases (simple shopping carts
or "hold a bitcoin balance for a customer and let them spend it") much, much
more complicated than necessary.  
  
What do other people think? I'd especially like to hear from people who have
prior experience using PHP to implement shopping carts and other simple
applications that deal with money. Did you use BCMATH/GMP?
