Hi there!  
  
I noticed that the NL locale for Bitcoin has some errors (quite some actually)  
So i made my corrections, attached is the nl locale .po file.  
  
 _edit: correctly used poedit this time_  

  
Thanks!  
  
Can somebody volunteer to be "translation pull person" for the new git
integration repository? The job would be packaging up changes into "pull
requests" (if the person doing the work can't or won't use git), giving them a
sanity test, and then pulling them into the integration repository.
