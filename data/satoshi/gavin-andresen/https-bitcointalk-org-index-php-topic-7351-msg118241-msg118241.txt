  
The input-transaction-selection algorithm in bitcoin tries to use older
transactions, which will have higher priority.  
  
I'd guess that online wallets with lots of users have plenty of old
transaction to choose from, so they don't need to pay transaction fees.
Actually, it'd be interesting to try to measure how quickly the average
bitcoin in an e-wallet stays in the wallet before being used for an outgoing
transaction...
