I just need a way to know if the addresses on the wallet are covered by the
last backup, and if there are still leftover addresses in the wallet, without
depending on running counts and persistent data not stored in bitcoin
directly.  

  
Keys in the keypool store when they're generated (and the oldest are always
used first). Asking "what's the oldest key in the key pool" seems reasonable,
and I think it would give you what you want-- you could compare that timestamp
to the timestamp of your last backup to see if you're covered.  
  
Although if you're going to periodically check to see what the oldest
timestamp is (or you're going to periodically check to see if bitcoin has
written a new timestamped backup file or periodically check WHATEVER) then it
seems simpler to me to just periodically always call backupwallet. Disk space
and bandwidth is cheap these days...
