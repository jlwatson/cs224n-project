RE: listing bitcoind separately on the clients page: good idea. casascius, do
you know (or are you willing to teach yourself) enough git to submit a pull
request to the https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.org repository?  
  
I think we should remove the direct download links from the bitcoin.org (and
wiki) homepage, too, and instead just link to the clients page.
