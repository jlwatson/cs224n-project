RE: refunding donations by proving you own one of the private keys that
donated: interesting idea! Anybody willing to write code to do that? Could be
a fun project... (find all the transactions that donated to EFF, dig out the
public keys, come up with a way to sign/verify a message with private key
proving you own a public key, then keep track of which donation transactions
have already been refunded)
