  
I agree-- we're in the Wild West days of open-source currency. I expect people
will get burned by scams, imitators, ponzi schemes and price bubbles..  
  
I tend not to worry about things that are out of my control; I don't think
there's a whole lot that can be done about scammers, imitators, and ponzi
schemes besides warning people to be careful with their money (whether
dollars, euros or bitcoins).
