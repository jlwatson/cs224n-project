Yes, this goes from new block announcements being O(nbytes) to O(nbytes/25) -- which is a fantastic more-than-order-of-magnitude speedup, but is still O(n).

My latest thinking is that to scale up many more orders of magnitude putting the IBLT idea on top of Matt's solution will be the best way to go.
