Biggest misconception: That Bitcoin will Topple Governments and the Powerful.  Governments will do what they always do -- they will adapt (well, the worst ones will fail, causing misery and suffering; maybe Bitcoin will speed that up a little, and mitigate the misery a little).

Far-out things only a few people seem to talk about: nothing comes to mind. Lots of people like talking about the far-out things.

TED talk: I actively try not to be the Celebrity Spokesmodel for the Bitcoin Project. Somebody else can do the TED talk.
