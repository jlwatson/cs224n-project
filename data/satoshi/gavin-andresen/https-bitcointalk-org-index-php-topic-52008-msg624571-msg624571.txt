  
Absolutely no guarantee is made that old, pre-rc6 private keys will not end up
unencrypted somewhere on the disk.  
  
There is no guarantee that newly generated, post-rc6 private keys will not end
up on the disk, either, although the code tries to keep that from happening
(locking memory so it is not swapped to disk, for example).  
  
There should be no files containing unencrypted private keys after rc6
rewrites the wallet, though.  
  
Thanks for helping test!
