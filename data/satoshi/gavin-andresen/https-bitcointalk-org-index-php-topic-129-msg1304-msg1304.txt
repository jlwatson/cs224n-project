I don't see the security risk of being able to intercept or eavesdrop on a
Bitcoin transfer.

  
When sending to an IP address, BitCoin contacts the IP address without any
authentication/encryption and requests a new BitCoin address, which is also
sent back in plaintext. You then send the BitCoins to that address in the
normal way. A man in the middle can intercept this request and send back
_their_ BitCoin address. You will then securely transfer BitCoins to the wrong
person.  

Ahh, right, I see; I hadn't thought through the mechanism of the pay-via-IP-
address functionality.  
  
That brings up another possible man-in-the-middle attack for HTTP connections:
if you see a Bitcoin address on a non-secure web page, you can't be sure that
you're seeing the correct address (a man-in-the-middle might have replaced it
with THEIR Bitcoin address). And ditto for sending your Bitcoin address to
somebody to request payment (e.g. send it via email or in your forum signature
and it might get replaced before being displayed to people who want to send
you money).
