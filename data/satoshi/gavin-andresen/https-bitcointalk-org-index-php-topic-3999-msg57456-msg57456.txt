Afaik it won't really speed it up in the current situation, but as soon as
bitcoin becomes more popular it will help proceeding transactions faster.  

Actually, I'm considering turning on transaction fees for the Bitcoin Faucet
because small transactions with "new" coins are given very low priority, and
recently new users are noticing that their Faucet coins are not arriving
promptly.
