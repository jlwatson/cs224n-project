You can. You can do similar things with gold, paper money, and so forth. The
fact that you can make it difficult to steal doesn't mean it is inherently any
more theftproof than anything else.  

  
It is pretty darn hard to make a billion dollars of gold (or paper money)
virtually theft-proof, especially if you're worried that your government might
decided it 'needs' some of it.  
  
Assuming bitcoins are eventually worth billions of dollars, it will be easy to
make a billion dollars of bitcoins virtually theft-proof. Heck, you could walk
around with a billion dollars worth of bitoins on an encrypted memory stick in
your pocket.  
  
With a backup in a safe deposit box in Switzerland. That's MUCH better than
gold or paper money.  
  
I'm starting to think that bitcoin as a store-of-value might end up being more
attractive than bitcoin as a medium-of-exchange.
