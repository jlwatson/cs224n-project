  
It is pretty darn hard to make a billion dollars of gold (or paper money)
virtually theft-proof, especially if you're worried that your government might
decided it 'needs' some of it.  
  
Assuming bitcoins are eventually worth billions of dollars, it will be easy to
make a billion dollars of bitcoins virtually theft-proof. Heck, you could walk
around with a billion dollars worth of bitoins on an encrypted memory stick in
your pocket.  
  
With a backup in a safe deposit box in Switzerland. That's MUCH better than
gold or paper money.  
  
I'm starting to think that bitcoin as a store-of-value might end up being more
attractive than bitcoin as a medium-of-exchange.
