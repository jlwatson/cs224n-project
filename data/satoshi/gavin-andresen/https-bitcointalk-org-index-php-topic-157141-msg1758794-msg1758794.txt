Your "plan" reminds me of an old joke...  

  
Okey dokey.  
  
If you want to be helpful, please write up a list of pros and cons for the
various plans that have been proposed, including your own (last time I asked
you, you waffled and didn't have any plan).  
  
I've been pretty busy dealing with the avalanche of press and working on the
payment protocol.
