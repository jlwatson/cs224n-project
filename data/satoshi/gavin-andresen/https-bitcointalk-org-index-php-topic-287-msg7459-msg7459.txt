The 1 BTC transaction is a transaction with 1 input and 2 outputs, but it's
still only 1 transaction.  

The rule is "if any TxOut (output) has a value of less than 0.01 bitcoins,
charge a 0.01 fee":  

Code:

main.h:  
foreach(const CTxOut& txout, vout)  
if (txout.nValue < CENT)  
nMinFee = CENT;
