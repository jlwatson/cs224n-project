 **Testnet difficulty calculation changes, to take effect Jan 1 2012**  
  
Allow mining of min-difficulty blocks if 20 minutes have gone by without
mining a regular-difficulty block.  
Normal rules apply every 2016 blocks, though, so there may be a very-slow-to-
confirm block at the difficulty-adjustment blocks (once per month, assuming
testnet is in it's normal "difficulty too high for number of people mining it"
state).  
  
This will almost certainly cause a testnet blockchain split after Jan 1. After
pulling I'll update the Testnet Faucet, I'll ask theymos if he can update the
testnet block explorer bitcoind.  
  
I didn't implement any "shun blocks from the future" or "prefer blocks with
more memory-pool transactions", I want to see how well the simplest-thing-
that-might-possibly-work solution works first.
