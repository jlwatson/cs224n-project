  
First: sorry for conflating the off-by-1 and the asymmetric adjustment issues.
As I said, I haven't taken the time to consider changing the bitcoin
difficulty adjustment algorithm (too big a change for too little benefit, in
my opinion; if we lose 90% of hashing power in a month then there that is a
sign something much more serious is wrong with bitcoin than the difficulty
algorithm; speculation on what will happen when the block reward drops seems
pointless to me, I don't think we'll know until it happens).  
  
Second: I've written 'discourage blocks' infrastructure:  
https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/tree/discourageblocks  
(code reviews welcome)  
  
... which should give us the ability to nudge miners to Do The Right Thing.
Discouraging blocks that appear to be gaming the off-by-one bug should be
enough incentive to prevent 50+% cartels from forming, without requiring a
blockchain-splitting change.
