I think a fully licensed online bitcoin exchange to/from US dollars via online
credit card transactions (or another really quick, convenient mechanism) is
critically needed.  
  
Is it worth attempting: I've been very tempted! Unfortunately, to do it right
and jump through all the legal hoops would require at least posting a $50,000
bond and probably thousands, possibly tens-of-thousands of dollars to hire
lawyers to get all the paperwork in order.  
  
And then I'd have to figure out how to accept credit card payments for
bitcoins in a way that didn't open me up to massive fraud (maybe secondary
approval via a phone call or text message). And convince a merchant account
provider that I'd solved that problem and that I was trustworthy (which
probably means another infusion of tens of thousands of dollars to cover
potential fraud).  
  
I think it is a great opportunity for somebody (or some company) who has had
prior experience in the currency exchange business. The business model is
clear and proven, and being the first fully licensed bitcoin exchange would
have huge potential benefits if Bitcoin turns out to be a really successful.
