Yes, there are "behind the scenes" actions that must take place regardless of
user intervention. Suppose the user has bought something; I want to be able to
ship the item as soon as the bitcoin transaction is confirmed.  

  
Transactions are confirmed when new blocks are accepted; that's the idea
behind my 95%-finished 'monitorreceived' code. It will POST to a URL when new
wallet transactions and blocks are accepted. The block information includes
all transaction ids (and a link to the previous block).  
  
As you note, you still have the issue of what to do if your code misses a
POST. That shouldn't be a big issue, though, because you'll resynchronize the
next time a block is found. Worst case, you'll ship to the customer 1 block
(10 minutes) later than is optimal if your connection to bitcoind is lost.
