RE: limitfreerelay:  
  
Agreed, that's better. I think we should start soft-coding the amount that is
considered "free" instead of hard-coding CENT, and make the default less than
0.0001 BTC.  
  
Separate subjects:  
  
The entire transaction memory pool should be size-limited, with lower-priority
transactions dropped.  
  
I agree with Steve-- free transactions are a HUGE selling point, and I think
rational miners should realize that their bitcoins will be more valuable if
there are more users. And there will be more users if "free transactions" is a
feature. I think we can come up with a solution where "normal" transactions
are free, but spam or abnormally complicated transactions (yes, like those
bitpenny rewards pooled mining participants are currently getting once a day)
"require" a fee (where "require" is really "if you don't include a fee your
transaction will probably never be confirmed.")  
  
And finally... we've got a problem right now; lets think about what fix(es)
move us in the right direction quickly, or think about fixes that will solve
the current problem (that we may need to undo/rework later).
