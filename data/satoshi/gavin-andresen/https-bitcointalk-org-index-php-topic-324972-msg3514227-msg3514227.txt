If this "80 msec delay" is the delay of the block being accepted by 51% of the
nodes, then it means that most miners are loosing money by accepting a fee
lower than 0.00333 BTC/KByte, which is the case most of the time.  
  
This is because each 80 msec costs 25*80/1000/60/10 = 0.00333 BTC  
Most of the current blocks have lower fees per Kbyte.  
  
In turns this means that, if miners start acting rationally, a standard
transaction cost should be at least USD 83 cents, with current exchange rate.
Which in turns means if header-only-push is not implemented, the Bitcoin value
cannot rationally be higher than 270 USD/BTC, since a 1 USD fee seems too much
for most of the common payments.  
  
  
Is this correct?  

  
Yes.  
  
I am much more worried about transaction fees right now than "selfish mining".
That is why I've been working on better fee estimation in the reference
implementation.  
  
I agree with Mike-- we need better measurement, and we need to make "full-
match merkle block relaying" the default to drive that 80ms number way down.
