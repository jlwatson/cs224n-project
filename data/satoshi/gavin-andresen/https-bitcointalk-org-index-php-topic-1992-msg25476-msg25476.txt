What are your thoughts on digital coin?  

I grabbed the "Digital Coin Technology" pdf file.  
  
It looks to me like it fails in the second paragraph:  

Quote

This Digital Coin serial number can be up to 512 numbers long. The Digital
Coin software alone can find, read and alter this serial number.

  
If the DigitalCoin software can read the serial number, then so can other
software. It is simply not true that "The DigitalCoin software alone can ..."  
  
Either you have a central server running the DigitalCoin software and you have
to trust that the people running that server won't double-spend DigitalCoins.  
  
Or... you have Bitcoin, where the "serial numbers" are the public keys of coin
generation transactions.
