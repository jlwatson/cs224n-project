I grabbed the "Digital Coin Technology" pdf file.  
  
It looks to me like it fails in the second paragraph:  
  
If the DigitalCoin software can read the serial number, then so can other
software. It is simply not true that "The DigitalCoin software alone can ..."  
  
Either you have a central server running the DigitalCoin software and you have
to trust that the people running that server won't double-spend DigitalCoins.  
  
Or... you have Bitcoin, where the "serial numbers" are the public keys of coin
generation transactions.
