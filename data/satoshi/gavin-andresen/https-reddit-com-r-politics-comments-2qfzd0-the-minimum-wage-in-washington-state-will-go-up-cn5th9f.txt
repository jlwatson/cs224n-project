Who are "they" ?

It looks to me like many of the industries that typically pay minimum wage are not very profitable:

... so if raising the minimum wage makes them even less profitable, won't that just encourage greedy capitalists to invest more in high tech or finance or other industries that don't hire minimum wage workers?
