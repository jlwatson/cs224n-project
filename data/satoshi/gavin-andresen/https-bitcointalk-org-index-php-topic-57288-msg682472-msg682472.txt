What do I personally think? I think it was mean, and luke-jr shouldn't have
done it.  
  
But if your system has a requirement "everybody will play nice" then your
system is broken. You have to assume that people will try to break what you
build (and also have to assume that nobody is perfect so you'll have to have a
way of fixing your system when you find out it is broken).  
  
So my heart feels sorry for CoiledCoin; my head thinks it is possible Luke-Jr
did all the altchains a favor by demonstrating a problem that needs to be
solved. And I'll re-iterate what I say in my "Be Safe" post: only invest money
or time in altcoins (or Bitcoin, for that matter) that you can afford to lose.
