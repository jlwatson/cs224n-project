Really? No influence?

You don't think congress-people, state legislators, or governors listen to the concerns of law enforcement and consider them when deciding to allocate budgets or prioritizing a legislative agenda?

I don't think law enforcement has control, but I think they have a lot of influence (not to mention quite a lot of .... Uhhhh... 'discretion'....  on which laws they choose to enforce vigorously).
