  
I don't think we'll **know** if it can work until it is tried; it does seem to
me that the incentives point the wrong way (if my doctor tells me I have six
months to live maybe I decide I deserve to run up my Ripple credit to the
max....) but maybe I'm just cynical (maybe there will be an equal or greater
number of people who decide to give away all their money through Ripple
instead of leave it to their deadbeat children).  
  
Good luck to Joel and Jed and the rest of the Ripple team!
