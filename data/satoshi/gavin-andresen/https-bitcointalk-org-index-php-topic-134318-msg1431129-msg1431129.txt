In my experience, developers are really good at either ignoring documentation
or interpreting it in a way different than the way the author intended.  
  
And spec authors are really good at getting details wrong, no matter how
careful they are. And they're really bad at keeping track of changes.  
  
That's why I spent a lot of time over the past year developing test cases and
tools that you can run your code against instead of writing specs.  
  
I may just be cynical because I spent so much time in 1997 working on the
ISO/IEC-14772-1 Official, Formal Standard.
