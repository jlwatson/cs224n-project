Unspent noninvested money is bad for any economy.  

Remind me of the broken window fallacy.  

... only if the investments are in things that don't make us more productive.  
  
There are really three categories, in order of desirability:  
  
1 Investment in productive activities  
2 Savings  
3 Investment in non-productive activities  
  
The broken window fallacy is confusing categories 1 and 3.
