Gavin, I swear I had your public key and can't find it. Where do you keep it
so I can verify the sums signature?

PGP links are on the bitcoin.org homepage;
http://bitcoin.org/gavinandresen.asc will get it.  
  
The source for the bitcoin.org homepage is at github, so you can get it from
there, too:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.org/blob/master/gavinandresen.asc  
  
It is also stored at the MIT pgp keyserver under email
'gavinandresen@gmail.com':
