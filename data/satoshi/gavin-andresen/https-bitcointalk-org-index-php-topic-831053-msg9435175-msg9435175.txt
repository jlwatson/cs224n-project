If "bits" continues to gain in popularity and support, then my support will
eventually follow naturally. I have tremendous respect for network effects
and, after all, language is for communicating.  

  
I'd also slightly prefer 'mikes', but consensus is for 'bits' among the people
who will actually Make This So (the big merchants/exchanges).
