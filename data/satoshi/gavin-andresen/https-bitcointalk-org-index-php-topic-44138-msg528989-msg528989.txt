  
Please don't spread misinformation.  
  
I agreed to join TruCoin a couple of months ago, because I knew Eric (chaord)
and Chris (cbrunner) through these forums and I think their vision and
experience give TruCoin a really good chance of being an important company in
the bitcoin economy.  
  
And they hired me because TruCoin won't go anywhere if core bitcoin falls
apart. I will (and have) mostly be working on core bitcoin issues, jumping in
and writing code that I think is critically needed that nobody else is
stepping up to write and working to make bitcoin as stable and secure as
possible.  
  
If Eric and Chris tell me to do something that is bad for bitcoin, I'll let
them know what I think. If they suddenly lose their minds and stop listening,
then I'll quit.  
  
If I lose my mind and start doing things that are bad for bitcoin as a whole
(or if I start trying to do things to bitcoin-core that benefit TruCoin over
everybody else), then you-all should fire me.
