why would they take so much longer to propagate?

Transaction validation can and is performed prior to new block announcement; compared to ecdsa verification (which is the work that can be performed in advance), validating against a warm UTXO CACHE (that is the work required when seeing a new block) is a trivial amount of CPU time.
