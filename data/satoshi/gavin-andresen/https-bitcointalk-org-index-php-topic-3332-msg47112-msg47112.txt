  
Thanks Hal!  
  
If I had a cluster of bitcoin transaction processing nodes (or a big mining
farm), I'd connect them with memcache and store transaction hashes/verified
flag pairs, so signatures were verified once. Or maybe just have one machine
filter transaction/block traffic and only pass along valid
transactions/blocks, and not have the rest of the machines even bother
checking signatures.  
  
It will be tougher for individual nodes. If they're not mining, they could
just check signatures ONLY on somebody-sent-to-them transactions.  
  
If they are mining... well, it seems to me single-node miners will become
increasingly rare as bitcoin scales up. Hardware farms or miners using a
mining pool seem like the way of the future.
