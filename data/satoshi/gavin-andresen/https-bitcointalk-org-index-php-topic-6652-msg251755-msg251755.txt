I just uploaded pdf and KeyNote versions of the talk I gave at the CIA last
Tuesday:

I took questions in the middle, before I dove into the technical details. I
was asked about whether or not I thought price instability would be a problem
("yes, I'll talk about that later") and how/why I got involved.  
  
Later, at the panel discussion, I was asked a question that showed I need to
do a better job of distinguishing bitcoin addresses and IP addresses. And I
was asked if there were moral issues, since bitcoin can be used by criminals
("I'm working on bitcoin because I think the potential benefits to the world
are much, much greater than the costs.")  
  
The other speakers were from PayPal, Facebook Payments, M-Pesa, Heartland
Payment Systems, and the Federal Reserve, so it was worth going just for the
connections. Bitcoin is definitely the new kid on the block, and I presented
it as such; not "bitcoin will take over the world" but "bitcoin is a very
interesting experiment that could be world-changing if it works out."  
  
And now... there is plenty of work to be done, so I'm going to stop
reminiscing about the good old days last week....
