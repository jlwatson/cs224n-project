I was just about to say the same thing; if there were multiple people all over
the world downloading and checking the binaries against the PGP signatures
that would be a wonderful thing, and would be much more robust against all the
various attacks that might happen (DNS poisoning on some subset of the
Internet, compromising one mirror, etc etc etc).
