I'm also thinking in setting up a script which every hour will download and
PGP verify the files, and send an alarm by email if see any problem. Do you
think that procedure can be helpful ?  

Absolutely. That is a perfect example of decentralized action at work... we
need as many people as possible checking these things.  

I was just about to say the same thing; if there were multiple people all over
the world downloading and checking the binaries against the PGP signatures
that would be a wonderful thing, and would be much more robust against all the
various attacks that might happen (DNS poisoning on some subset of the
Internet, compromising one mirror, etc etc etc).
