Can you please let me know if this works on OSX 10.5:

I set up a new build environment on an old, 32-bit OSX 10.6 laptop, and I
think I fixed the 10.5 compatibility issue.  
  
(some MacPorts maintainers don't seem to be terribly good at making sure their
ports honor BOTH the -arch AND the -isysroot settings...)
