Implementing this in a convenient way would be tough, and it would be blocked
by IsStandard.  

  
No, implementing it would be easy. Implement it (don't forget the UI), test it
on the test network (where it is pretty trivial to get non-IsStandard stuff
into blocks), and then lobby for a new 'standard' transaction type.  
  
theymos, please stop acting like the current IsStandard test is set in stone.
It is not, and, as Satoshi said, new versions of the client are rapidly
adopted by a majority of the network, so introducing a new transaction type
will not be a big deal.
