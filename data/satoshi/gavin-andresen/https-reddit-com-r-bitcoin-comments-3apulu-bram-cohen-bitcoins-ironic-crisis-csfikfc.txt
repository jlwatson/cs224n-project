I can't think of anybody with whom I trade some bitcoin value back and forth. In fact, I can't really think of anybody with whom I regularly trade dollars back and forth-- I tend to either receive them (from my employer or from acting as a merchant) or send them (when I want to hire people or buy things). That is just not a use case that happens for me. What use case are you thinking of, Greg?
