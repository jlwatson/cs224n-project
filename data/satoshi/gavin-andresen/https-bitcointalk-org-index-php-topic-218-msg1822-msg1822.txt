I am also running bitcond 1.3 (RC?) that satoshi just posted. How do I use it
though? There aren't many docs on using bitcoind... it just said "starting
bitcoin server", and my IP appears in the #bitcoin room on irc.lfnet.org. How
would I figure out my bitcoin address, how many coins I have, send to other
people, etc?  

You can talk to the running bitcoind either by:  
1\. sending JSON-RPC calls; see http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=api
for more details.  
2\. re-running bitcoind and giving it extra arguments; it will figure out that
there's already a bitcoind running and will pass along the commands.  
  
For example, running "bitcoind help" gives you the list of commands it
understands:  

Code:

bitcoind help  
getaddressesbylabel <label>  
listreceivedbyaddress [minconf=1] [includeempty=false]  
getreceivedbyaddress <bitcoinaddress> [minconf=1]  
getbalance  
getblockcount  
getblocknumber  
getconnectioncount  
getdifficulty  
getgenerate  
getinfo  
getlabel <bitcoinaddress>  
getnewaddress [label]  
getreceivedbyaddress <bitcoinaddress> [minconf=1]  
getreceivedbylabel <label> [minconf=1]  
help  
listreceivedbyaddress [minconf=1] [includeempty=false]  
listreceivedbylabel [minconf=1] [includeempty=false]  
listtransactions [count=10] [includegenerated=false]  
sendtoaddress <bitcoinaddress> <amount> [comment] [comment-to]  
setgenerate <generate> [genproclimit]  
setlabel <bitcoinaddress> <label>  
stop  

  
To figure out what your bitcoin address is, run:  
 ~~bitcoind getaddressesbylabel ""~~  
 ~~(your default address has the empty string as its label).~~  

Code:

bitcoind getaddressesbylabel "Your Address"

To figure out how many coins you have, run:  

Code:

bitcoind getbalance

or  

Code:

bitcoind getinfo

  
Regarding running headless: the non-daemon bitcoin will run via remote (e.g.
ssh forwarded) X-windows, if you install the necessary X11-client stuff on
your server.
