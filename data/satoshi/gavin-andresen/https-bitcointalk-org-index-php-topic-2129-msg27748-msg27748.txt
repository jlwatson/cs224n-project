What's a non-standard transaction?  

  
A transaction that is signed in a way that the standard bitcoin client doesn't
understand.  
  
For example, there's been some discussion in other threads about using OP_DROP
to embed extra data in transactions; doing something like that would create
non-standard transactions.
