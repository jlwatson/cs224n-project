RE: lightweight versus heavyweight clients:  
  
First: lightweight clients (like Multibit) that don't store the entire
blockchain must rely on the rest of the network to confirm that transactions
are valid. They can't check for themselves (this is true today, and BIP 16
doesn't change that at all).  
  
Full clients do check, but it is still not safe for them to accept 0- or
1-confirmation transactions; an attacker might be sending them an attempted
double-spend (and the network might be still be trying to figure out which
'side' of the double-spend will win). That is also true today.  
  
"Backwards compatibility" means that all valid transactions created by the new
software will be accepted as valid transactions by the old software.  
  
But, after BIP 16 is supported by a majority of the network, there could exist
transactions that the old software considers valid but the new software
rejects as invalid.  
  
So... does BIP 16 make things riskier for people running old software? Yes, a
tiny bit, in the very particular case of 1-confirmation transactions. And that
particular attack requires that the attacker manage to mine a block that they
know will be found invalid (which is expensive). Again, if you get bitcoins
from somebody you do not trust then you should wait until they have 3 or more
(6 if you want to be extremely safe) confirmations before considering the
payment final.  
  
If you want all the technical details of why BIP 16 does NOT increase the risk
for 0-confirmation transactions but does for 1-confirmation transactions...
ask me another day (it has to do with how the old software recognizes
"Standard" transactions and won't even show you transactions it doesn't
recognize).
