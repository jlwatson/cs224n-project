Short answer: you don't have to worry about it.  
  
Long answer: if you **want** to worry about being as network-bandwidth-
efficient as possible, run one node normally, and run all the rest with the
-noirc -connect=IP.AD.DR.SS flags so they connect only to the one 'master'
node. All the network traffic will then go through the master node.
