If there's a c++ programmer out there looking for a good "get me feet wet"
project involving Bitcoin, I think importing/exporting public/private keypairs
(in one of OpenSSL's file formats) would be a really good choice.  
  
The hard part is importing; you'd have to write code to re-scan the block
chain to find transactions to/from the newly imported public/private keys, and
add them to the wallet.
