In a bank if you deposit X coins you can withdraw at most X.  

My bank must be weird, they let me withdraw more than X and let me carry a
negative balance for a little while (a service they charge for).  
  
With the accounts feature, if you have an account containing X bitcoins there
are two ways to overdraw it:  
  
1\. Using the move command. Negative balances have a lot of use-cases, and
last time I checked accountants know how to deal with negative account
balances.  
  
2\. Using the sendfrom command, if a transaction fee is required then the fee
is charged to the "sendfrom" account and may take it negative.  
  
Are you sometimes using "sendtoaddress" and sometimes "sendfrom" ? Or are you
using both the GUI (designed for a single user's wallet) and the RPC? If you
want to use the accounts feature, don't do that, always use "sendfrom".  
  
Better accounting for transaction fees is a valid complaint, always deducting
the fee from the "sendfrom" account can be annoying. It doesn't violate
accounting principles, though; if you want the transaction fee to be paid from
some other account, then you just sendfrom() and then move() to adjust account
balances.  
  
If you really want to find something about the accounts feature to complain
about, then you should complain that it doesn't scale.
