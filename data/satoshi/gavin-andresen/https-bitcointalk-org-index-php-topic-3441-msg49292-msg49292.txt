  
I think it is a reasonable assumption that major miners will be well-connected
with each other. There is certainly a strong incentive for miners to be well-
connected in general (better connected == more likely to win 'block races').  
  
So I don't see how you could freeze the block chain-- if you generate lots of
double-spends, the miners will quickly see both of spends and will drop those
transactions like hot potatoes. The "finney attack" only works if the first
double-spend is generated by a miner that finds a block and includes it in the
block without transmitting it.  
  
Also, my proposal was to only reject blocks containing 'suspicious'
transactions that you hadn't seen transmitted that have a double-spend attempt
before the next block.
