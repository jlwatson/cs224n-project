Yes, approximately nobody will mine on the 1MB chain. Why would you, if your coins would be rejected by all of the big merchants and exchanges?

That doesn't mean all blocks will be bigger than 1MB, it just means that a miner that refuses to build on a bigger-than-1MB-block is being an idiot.

I don't think we have many idiot miners, making a profit at solo mining or running a mining pool is not easy.
