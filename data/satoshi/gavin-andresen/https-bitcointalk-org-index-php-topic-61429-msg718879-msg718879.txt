You know how I say "I make mistakes, don't trust me" ...  
  
A bug in my code is dropping transaction fees from the block reward. Simple to
fix, and obvious in hindsight; I will be personally reimbursing everybody who
got bit by this bug by finding the blocks affected by this, figuring out what
transaction fees the creators SHOULD have received, and sending that number of
bitcoins to the block-award address.  
  
Backports and the main git HEAD tree have been patched with the fix.

On a higher level:  
  
There is obviously not going to be 50+% blockchain support for BIP 16 on
Tuesday; I'm going to start conversations on how to move forward.  
  
And there has obviously not been enough testing of the BIP 16 code. Getting
people to thoroughly test things BEFORE code makes it into the main tree has
been a chronic problem, I'd appreciate ideas on how to avoid this kind of
annoying, time-wasting "it's ready"/"oops, found a bug"/"it's fixed"/"wait,
no, somebody found another bug" thing in the future. I've been unsuccessful
finding the kind of QA (quality assurance) person who can both do the QA and
do the fundraising necessary so they get paid.
