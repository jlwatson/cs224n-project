RE: opening up the "store random stuff in the block chain" argument:  
  
Several things make me not worried about that:  
  
1\. OP_CHECKSIG drives network-wide costs (see the thread on network-wide
transaction cost back-of-the-envelope calculations).  
2\. New -limitefreerelay code will, I'm pretty confident, mitigate penny-
flooding.  
3\. 512 bytes plus inputs plus outputs will will make these either "very-low-
priority-free" or over 1K non-free transactions.  
4\. We're past the point where block chain download size is 'convenient' for
new users. We should implement lightweight client mode (download only block
headers until you start solo mining) as soon as possible.  
  
  
RE: pregenerate a bunch of addresses to use for payment:  
  
I like that idea! If you're getting, say, 20 bitcoin orders a day then 1,000
addresses would last you a month. And even if you recycled them when you ran
out it should be easy to match orders to addresses based on the transaction
date and amount...  
  
  
The whole "click to pay" feature needs to be figured out, and should work
nicely in all four cases of (customer,merchant) using (bitcoin,online wallet).
My brain isn't up to it today, though...
