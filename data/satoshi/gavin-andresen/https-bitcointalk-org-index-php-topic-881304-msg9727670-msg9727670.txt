Excellent advice.  
  
I'd add: you never have infinite time, so you will have to prioritize.  
  
Cryddit's original post talks a fair bit about preventing data leakage in
side-channel attacks; I'll just say that if you only have time to either get
100% code path unit test coverage or hand-code some assembly to workaround
your compiler leaving a private key in memory instead of a register... I'd
work on the test coverage.  
  
And if the choice is between 100% test coverage versus 91% with support for
threshold signatures on multiple devices-- I'd choose threshold signatures.  
  
And, of course, the highest priority is creating a product or service that is
both trustworthy and that people want to use.
