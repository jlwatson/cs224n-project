Be nice, y'all. Todd emailed me directly and I steered him here because I
don't have time to talk about economic theory with everybody who emails me
these days.  
  
Todd: if you were designing a new currency, what would it look like? Are you
imagining a LETS-like system of credit?  
  
Bitcoin is designed to be like a scarce natural resource, which is pretty
conservative, really-- scarce natural resources have a long history of being
used as currency. I don't know enough about the alternatives to know whether
or not they could work as an Internet currency-- the LETS systems I've heard
about all rely on local interactions and trust to keep people from cheating.  
  
PS: I'm going to move this thread to the Economics forum.
