https://github.com/Lekensteyn/pacemaker is a little SSL server to test SSL
clients for heartbleed vulnerability.  
  
I installed Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0 on my Mac (compiled against the
vulnerable openssl 1.0.1f), created a web page to launch a payment request
fetch from pacemaker...  
  
... and I get good news:  

Code:

Connection from: 127.0.0.1:62937  
Possibly not vulnerable  

  
Step-by-step so you can help test on other OS'es :  
  

  * git clone https://github.com/Lekensteyn/pacemaker.git
  * cd pacemaker
  * python pacemaker.py
  * Run Bitcoin Core GUI version 0.9.0
  * In your browser, visit https://bitcoincore.org/~gavin/heartbleed.html

  
pacemaker.py should report a connection, and then either say "Client returned
blah bytes" or "Possibly not vulnerable"  
  
It looks to me like pacemaker.py IS working; visiting https://127.0.0.1:4433/
in Chrome pacemaker tells me:  

Code:

Connection from: 127.0.0.1:62514  
Client returned 7 (0x7) bytes  
0000: 15 03 03 00 02 02 2f ....../  

  
This isn't a definitive "no need to worry even if you HAVE clicked on payment-
protocol-enabled bitcoin: links at an untrustworthy website" ... but given the
evidence I've seen, it seems to me extremely unlikely anybody's private keys
have been compromised.
