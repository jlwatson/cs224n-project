  
Wait... no... that example is only valid for the "attacker takes over existing
mining pools" case, where formerly honest miners are co-opted to be evil (or
gang up in a cartel to be evil).  
  
If somebody collects as much hashing power as the rest of the network combined
and _then_ suddenly attacks, then yes, indeed, difficulty stays the same, the
attacker gets all the mining rewards, and there are twice as many stale blocks
as before. Attacker gets 6 block rewards per hour.  
  
If they were to mine honestly, blocks would be created twice as fast until
difficulty adjusted, so they'd get 6 block rewards per hour for a week (same
as if they decide to attack). Then difficulty would double, and they'd get
only 3 per hour.
