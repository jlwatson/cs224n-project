Did you ever consider maybe it is you, not them?

Personally, I find your attitude and approach off-putting. I find you very "you're doing it wrong and you're an idiot and you should do it my way" versus "have you considered doing it this way, maybe it would be better...."

Maybe that's just me. But maybe you should consider doing things a different way, maybe it would be better.....
