I propose 3 step phase plan:  
  
step 1. Protocol specifics are definitively agreed upon. No going back after
this step. Takes as long as it has too, but ideally 1 month.  
step 2. Implementations are all synchronised and ready with branch/patches
ready to accept the new changes. Testing needs to be done. 1 month.  
step 3. A date is set for the switch-over. Packages are released and all
merchants/users/vendors/miners are given a switch-over date before the change
becomes live. Enough time needs to be give for everybody to change over. I
propose 2 months.  
  
After this and with enough testing, the OP_EVAL can be introduced into the GUI
and such after a while. This puts the total timeframe at around under 6
months.  

  
The beauty of OP_EVAL is it is backwards-compatible with old
merchants/users/vendors/miners; there is no reason to require that they all
switch over at the same time, they can continue to operate with their old
software for as long as they like (assuming all this happens, there will be
increasing pressure over time for them to upgrade so they can pay to
newfangled BIP 13 bitcoin addresses).
