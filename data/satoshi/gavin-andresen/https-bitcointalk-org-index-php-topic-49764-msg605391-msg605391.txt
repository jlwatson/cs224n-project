  
The beauty of OP_EVAL is it is backwards-compatible with old
merchants/users/vendors/miners; there is no reason to require that they all
switch over at the same time, they can continue to operate with their old
software for as long as they like (assuming all this happens, there will be
increasing pressure over time for them to upgrade so they can pay to
newfangled BIP 13 bitcoin addresses).
