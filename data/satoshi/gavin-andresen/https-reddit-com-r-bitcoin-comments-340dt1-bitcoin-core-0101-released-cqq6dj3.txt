Because the p2p networking code isn't robust enough to call it "1.0" (it is an accreted set of hacks to mitigate DoS/Sybil attacks; it should keep track of resources used by each peer, and prioritize work so no peer can overwhelm CPU or bandwidth or disk usage).

And because the wallet code needs work to match best practices (use keys derived from a master seed, do NOT rely on BerkeleyDB).
