I guess my question is, what makes Bitcoin better than Litecoin other than
being the first of the two to get acceptance?  

Network effect.  
  
More developers are working on Bitcoin, there are more interesting projects,
more useful tools, more documentation at places like
bitcoin.stackexchange.com, etc. And that all builds on itself.
