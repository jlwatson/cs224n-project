I think of this as a subset of the "I want to move N bitcoins from my wallet
to a USB stick that I'll put in my safe deposit box so it cannot be hacked",
"bitcoins as a long-term store of value" feature:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues#issue/2  
  
A solution should:  
\+ Make accidental double-spending impossible (or at least, very hard)  
\+ Remove the private keys from your wallet so if the wallet is stolen they
coins are safe  
\+ Be as close to 100% safe as possible, even if your computer gets hit by
lightning at exactly the wrong time.  
  
That last one is the tricky bit.
