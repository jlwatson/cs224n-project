RE: JSON-RPC error / HTTP status codes: I'm about to submit a patch to Satoshi
so bitcoin better follows the JSON standards. I'll create a new thread
describing the changes.  
  
RE: binding to any/all IPs: DANGER! Make sure you have good firewall rules for
port 8332 or you are likely to find yourself with an empty wallet! Bitcoin is
using HTTP BASIC authentication, so anybody who can eavesdrop on the
connection between your JSON-RPC client and the bitcoin server can see the
password (it is NOT encrypted).
