So you drop a settings file in the ~/.bitcoin directory, that sounds better.
In the "no password is set" warning, it could tell you where the file is and
what to do.  
What is the most popular and common settings file format?  

You ask hard questions! Most common: probably Windows INI files, because
Windows is most common OS.  
  
I'd lobby for using JSON; it's (mostly) a subset of YAML (which is a common
choice for config files), so any JSON or YAML parser will read it.

HTTP basic authentication should be considered. In actual practice though,
it's more work for web developers to figure out how to specify the password
through some extra parameter in the HTTP or JSON-RPC wrapper than to just
stick an extra parameter at the beginning of the parameter list. What do you
think? Does HTTP basic authentication get us any additional benefits?  

I think the only big advantage is that it keeps authentication where it
belongs in the transport layer, so if, in the future, you **do** want to go
with full-fledged HTTPS with certificates the API doesn't have to change.

I was confused for a bit because the password is given LAST on the command
line, but FIRST in the JSON-RPC params list. I agree that reading the command-
line password from a file would be more convenient and more secure.  

You're also confusing me, what do you mean? Did I do something unintended?  

No, I just confused "command" with "parameter", and did this:  
  

Code:

> bitcoind help  
error: First parameter must be the password.  
> bitcoind <my password> help  
error: unknown command: <my password>  
>bitcoind help <my password>  
... that works.
