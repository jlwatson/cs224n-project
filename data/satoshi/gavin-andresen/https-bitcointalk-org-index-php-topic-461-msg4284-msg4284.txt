You ask hard questions! Most common: probably Windows INI files, because
Windows is most common OS.  
  
I'd lobby for using JSON; it's (mostly) a subset of YAML (which is a common
choice for config files), so any JSON or YAML parser will read it.  
I think the only big advantage is that it keeps authentication where it
belongs in the transport layer, so if, in the future, you **do** want to go
with full-fledged HTTPS with certificates the API doesn't have to change.  
No, I just confused "command" with "parameter", and did this:  
  

Code:

> bitcoind help  
error: First parameter must be the password.  
> bitcoind <my password> help  
error: unknown command: <my password>  
>bitcoind help <my password>  
... that works.
