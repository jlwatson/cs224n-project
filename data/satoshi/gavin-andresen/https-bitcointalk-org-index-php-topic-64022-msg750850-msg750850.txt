  
I've got a "noprivacy" branch of bitcoin that I use for the Faucet:  
https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/tree/noprivacy  
  
Instead of creating a new address for change, it uses one of the input's
addresses.  
  
It works nicely if your entire bitcoin balance is one "account", but will fail
if you're using the accounts feature to keep track of separate balances (which
is why it will probably never be a mainline feature).
