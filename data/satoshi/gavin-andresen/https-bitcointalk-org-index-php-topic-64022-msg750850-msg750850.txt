If I have 50 BTC on my address and I want to send 10 BTS to another address
then the rest of 50 BTC = 40 BTC will sent to a new generated address.  
I know that was integrated to make the flow more anonymous.  
  
Is there a possibilty to deactivate this function?  
  
Because I need a clean simple transaction history where I and other users can
check it.  

  
I've got a "noprivacy" branch of bitcoin that I use for the Faucet:  
https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/tree/noprivacy  
  
Instead of creating a new address for change, it uses one of the input's
addresses.  
  
It works nicely if your entire bitcoin balance is one "account", but will fail
if you're using the accounts feature to keep track of separate balances (which
is why it will probably never be a mainline feature).
