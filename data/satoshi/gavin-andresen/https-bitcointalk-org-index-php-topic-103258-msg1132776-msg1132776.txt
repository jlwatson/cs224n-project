The attacker will pay transaction fees to send those spammy inputs, and that
has been a large enough disincentive that it hasn't happened.  
  
That said, SelectCoins aught to be improved; ideally, it should never include
an input if the fee for adding that input is greater than that input's value.  
  
Or maybe it should just ignore inputs below the 'spam transaction' threshold
for now, as being more trouble than they're worth.
