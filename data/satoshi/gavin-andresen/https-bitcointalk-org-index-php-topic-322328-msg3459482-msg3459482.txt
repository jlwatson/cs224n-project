50k won't go far if we pay salaries. we have to be smart with the money and
invest in common permanent infrastructure. we should find better ways to pay
for ongoing costs by creating sustainable businesses.  

  
Exactly right, in my humble opinion.  
  
I suspect you're going to have a hard time figuring out how to arrange
yourselves without becoming a Corporation of some State and still have a
business model that sustains sufficient quality assurance and customer support
to make Dark Wallet a success.  
  
PS: I'm really happy to see other implementations happening! Diversity is
great!  
  
PPS: y'all should give the Foundation at least a LITTLE bit of credit for
funding CoinPunk...
