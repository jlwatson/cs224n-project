Standard disclaimer first: I am often wrong.  
  
But I've got a nagging feeling that all of the pure Proof-Of-X (where X !=
Work) systems would set up a dynamic of "the rich and powerful get more rich
and more powerful."  
  
The more coins you have, the more you get, as far as I can see in all of the
proposed schemes (another disclaimer: I only vaguely pay attention to all of
the Proof-of-X schemes, so feel free to tell me how I'm wrong). Seems to me
that would end up being a destructive feedback loop, where your decentralized
currency naturally gets more and more centralized over time.
