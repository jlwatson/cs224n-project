Gavin, do you have / can you make public the image for the dodgy 0.3.20 VC10
build? I'd like to have a look and compare it to my home build to see if I can
reproduce that rendering artifact problem. Thanks.  

  
Yes, I have the VC10 VM. I am hesitant to make it publicly available because
it has a copy of Visual C++ 2010 Express installed, and I don't want Microsoft
to sue me for redistributing their software without permission.  
  
I'll uninstall it from the VM and then make the image public; you'll have to
download and install (and agree to the license) Visual Studio Express yourself
to get it working.
