But how would you distinguish between a legitimate micropayment-processing IP
and a spammy "I want to make Bitcoin use so much bandwidth nobody is willing
to run it any more" IP?  
  
Really small micropayments seem to me to be a really hard problem, and I don't
think Bitcoin should try to solve too many very hard problems all at once.
