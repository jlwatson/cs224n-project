Thanks for the donations... whoever you are who donated!  
  
The Faucet has about 2,000 coins in it at the moment; I just deployed a new
version that will automatically start giving out bit-nickels if the balance
falls below 500 (but allows anybody who gets a bit-nickel to come back later
and get the 5 bitcoins "they deserve" if/when the Faucet is refilled).
