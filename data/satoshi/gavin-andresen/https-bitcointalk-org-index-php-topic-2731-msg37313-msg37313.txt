RE: point you in the right direction:  
  
File rpc.cpp, the CommandLineRPC method:  
  
I suspect what needs to be done is to properly JSON encode any strings passed
via the command line.  
  
And then properly decode/recode any strings returned from the JSON RCP call
before printing out the result.
