ribuck: The Faucet is currently giving out between 5 and 6 BTC per day
(100-200 payouts per day).  
  
BioMike: Are you creating an AdWords-like service, but bidding/paying in
Bitcoin? One reason I like AdsCaptcha is because if won't clutter up the
Faucet page with ads.  
  
[mike]: Thanks for the pointers RE: how much it costs to get google/yahoo/etc
accounts; I have been tempted to give out more coins from the Faucet to people
with Google accounts.  
  
  
I'm going to give AdsCaptcha a try; if the ads are annoying or offensive or
inappropriate or doesn't work with ad blockers I'll switch back to reCaptcha.
