Bitcoin Foundation uses CloudFlare to protect bitcoinfoundation.org from
distributed denial of service attacks.  
  
As the message says, either your computer or a computer on the same network /
ISP as yours was sending lots of spammy requests to CloudFlare. So they ask
you to solve a CAPTCHA to prove that you're not part of the bad guy's botnet.
