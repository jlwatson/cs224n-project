Thanks for all the great feedback!  
  
Maybe one way to think about ClearCoin is as a tool to help manage risk
between buyer and seller.  
  
If the buyer completely trusts the seller, then you don't need ClearCoin--
just send bitcoins directly.  
If the seller completely trusts the buyer, then just send the product first.  
  
Usually there's some level of trust/mistrust between buyer and seller. If you
use ClearCoin in creative ways, you should be able to come up with a way of
using ClearCoin that balances the risks to both buyers and sellers.  
  
To take davout's example: The person paying could deposit 20% of the funds in
a ClearCoin account, then immediately release that 20% as a "good faith
payment". Then they deposit the other 80%.  
  
That gives an 80/20 risk split. "Half now, half on delivery" type arrangements
can be done the same way.  
  
davidonpda: You can choose how long your coins will be tied up when you create
the escrow account-- one month, six months, or a year. Of course, the longer
they're held the more comfortable the person on the other side of the
transaction will be.  
  
PS to Vinnie: ClearWing Software is the company; ClearCoin is the service.
