Update: Now I move coins to a special sendmany account before trying to
sendmany but it still doesn't work. It wants to CONFIRM A TRANSACTION I SEND
TO MYSELF before adding the balance.  

Pass a 0 as the third argument to sendmany and it will send unconfirmed coins:  

Code:

sendmany <fromaccount> {address:amount,...} [minconf=1] [comment]
