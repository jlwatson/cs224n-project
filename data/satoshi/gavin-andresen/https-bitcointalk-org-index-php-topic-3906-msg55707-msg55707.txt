What happens if:  
  
\-- you dump a private key from bitcoin client 'A'  
\-- shutdown A  
\-- import it into bitcoin client 'B'  
\-- spend it from B  
... wait for a confirmation or three...  
\-- restart A  
  
Does A notice that the coin's been spent? I think there's a bug that it does
not, and I think that bug needs to be fixed before we make it easy to
export/import private keys. So, please bang on sipa's patch and see if
anything else breaks!
