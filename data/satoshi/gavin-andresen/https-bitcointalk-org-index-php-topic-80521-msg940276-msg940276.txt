  
Signatures are BER-encoded data structures, and can be an arbitrary number of
bytes (if they're DER-encoded, which is the strict subset of BER encoding,
then they're 70-something bytes).  
  
Public keys are either 33 or 65 bytes (not counting the "push the next N bytes
onto the stack" CSCript opcode).  
  
I've got to say you make me nervous; you seem to be following a "make it work
for a couple of test cases then move on" style of development, which is a bad
way to create a secure, robust codebase.  
  
PS: I sympathize with you RE: OpenSSL's lack of documentation....
