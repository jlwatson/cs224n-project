I hope they find and prosecute the bastards; DDoSing somebody because you
disagree with them is never OK.  
  
In fact, I think there is never a situation where DDoSing is OK, even if
you're trying to accomplish something good (philosophical discussions about
ends justifying the means should move to off-topic...)
