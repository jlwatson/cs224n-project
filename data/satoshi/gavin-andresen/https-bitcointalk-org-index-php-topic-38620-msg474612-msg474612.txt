You're talking about the developers intentionally revoking previously-valid
transactions by central fiat - and they can't just revoke the ones involved in
the double-spend, they have to revoke all of them.  

  
Why couldn't the-collective-we only revoke the double-spends (and subsequent
txns that depended on them) ?  
  
A hard-coded list of invalid txids wouldn't be hard to insert into the is-
valid-transaction checks, and that along with a blockchain checkpoint would
work just fine. Valid transactions on the bad chain would move to the new
chain (actually, they'd already be on the non-attacker chain, since the miners
on both sides of the block split would have included them).
