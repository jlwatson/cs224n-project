No; the only 0.8 users who should upgrade are miners who are creating blocks
themselves (mining pool operators, solo miners, or people using p2pool).  
  
Big merchants/services/exchanges who want to be as certain as possible they
don't end up on the wrong side of a blockchain fork should also upgrade,
although I think the risk of that happening if they keep running 0.8.0 is
small.
