But loosing 1 bitcoin in the ocean of a maximum of 21.000.000 coins seems
significant to me, so not comparable to gold and jewelry.  
So only 21000 losses of 1000 coins can happen. That's not much!  

But remember that each bitcoins can be divided into 100 million pieces, as
needed.  
  
And the more valuable they become, the more careful people will be not to lose
them.
