  
Huh.  
  
That's a problem with BIP 20-- it doesn't say how the parameters are encoded.
I assumed they were encoded the same way as http URLs (application/x-www-form-
encoded) because the bitcoin: scheme is very similar to the http scheme (where
everything after the ? is x-www-form-encoded); are they not?
