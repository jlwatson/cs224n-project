RE: pulling the wallet private key encryption ASAP: Agreed 100%  
  
I wanted to start discussing split keys now because if we need a new standard
transaction type then it is best to do that in stages-- let clients relay, and
miners include in blocks, the new transaction type. Then once most of the
network will accept the new transactions, people can actually start USING
them.
