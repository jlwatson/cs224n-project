Possible fix for GUI freezing on Windows after a crash:  
  
I started an in depth investigation and used Sysinternals Procmon.exe for
this. I wanted to know which files or registry keys the client processes and
one folder came to my attention.  

Nice! Thank you very much for looking deeply into this; it looks like the
inter-process-communication doo-hickey bitcoin uses to handle bitcoin: URLs
was left behind when you blue-screened, and that's making startup fail the
next time around.
