Decentralized systems often settle into some kind of "power law distribution."  
  
For example, there's no central authority determining how large cities all
over the world should be, and yet if you plot the size of cities you'll see
that there are a few REALLY big ones, a bunch of medium sized ones, and a
gazillion small ones.  
  
Plot the size of the bitcoin mining pools and I think you'll see the same
thing.  
  
If there were no mining pools, then plot the hashing power of individual
miners and I bet you'd see the same thing... (ArtForz used to be a significant
fraction of mining power all by himself, for example)  
  
I worry a lot more about incentives than I do size; if the "naturally big"
players have the right incentives, then they're not bad for the network. So
far, I think the incentives are working nicely. For example, people HAVE tried
to knock out the big mining pools and exchanges using denial-of-service
attacks, and the big mining pools and exchanges have (as far as I can tell)
worked to fix that problem themselves.  
  
PS: p2pool built into a bitcoin client is something I'd fully support, I think
a lot of people would like a one-button "get a trickle of bit-pennies" option.
