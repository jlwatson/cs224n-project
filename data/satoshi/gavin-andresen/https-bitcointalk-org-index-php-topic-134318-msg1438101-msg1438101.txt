I completely agree that more documentation is better, as long as you don't
fall into the trap of "if the documentation says it it MUST be true."  
  
Suggestions on how to make the wiki better welcome (there is a discussion
elsewhere about banning certain people from the wiki because they have a
history of starting edit wars, which I would support, and discussion on the
Foundation forums about making the wiki infrastructure independend of Mt. Gox,
which I also support). Or volunteers to move technical documentation from the
wiki to someplace better also welcome.
