I have been developing myself over the last 20 years on AmigaOS, MS-DOS,
Windows NT, Linux, Mac OS X, iOS and Android platforms (in more or less that
order...)  

  
Nice! We need a good Mac OSX developer, do you know C++? Are you willing to
learn Qt?  
  
My main machine is a Mac, but I'm not an expert OSX developer (I spend all my
time in a Terminal window in emacs, pretending my Mac is a Unix machine).
