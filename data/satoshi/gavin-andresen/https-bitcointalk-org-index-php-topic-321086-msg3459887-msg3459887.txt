uhhh... Were you a postmodern lit major in college?  
  
  
I've got a pretty simple, but I think fairly accurate, view of money/wealth.  
  
I believe you can't create wealth just by printing money. You can create the
illusion of wealth (and I imagine some Keynesians would argue the illusion is
enough to lubricate the economy and somehow increase productivity and growth
and wealth; lets set aside that argument).  
  
You can create wealth by making it easier for people to transact (and money is
the world's best invention for doing that, barter is terribly inefficient).  
  
I'm still stuck on how y'all think altcoins create wealth. I don't see any of
them being any easier to transact than Bitcoin.
