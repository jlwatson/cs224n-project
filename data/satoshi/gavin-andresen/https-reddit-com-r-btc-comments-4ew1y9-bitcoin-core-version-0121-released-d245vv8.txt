SOV == Store of Value.

I disagree with cypherdoc: I think a money that evolves is a great store of value, as long as the evolution is done carefully so that people storing value are unaffected.

I disagree with the order in which Core is rolling out these BIPs -- they're prioritizing features that will make implementing the lightning network easier.

Ideally, something like CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY/CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY would be part of a Script redesign. Every time you see a new VERIFY opcode, it is technical debt-- it would be technically cleaner and more powerful if there were generic PUSH_TRANSACTION_INFO and PUSH_BLOCK_INFO opcodes and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (and all sorts of other powerful stuff) was built out of those more generic concepts.

Reasonable people can disagree about whether it is worth having CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY now, as a feature that will have to be supported forever (assuming it activates).  It is not a HUGE amount of code, and it enables more than just Lightning, so getting it sooner rather than tackling a complete Script rewrite is probably the right thing to do.

But fixing transaction confirmation reliability (aka INCREASE THE FRICKING BLOCK SIZE LIMIT ALREADY) should be a much higher priority.
