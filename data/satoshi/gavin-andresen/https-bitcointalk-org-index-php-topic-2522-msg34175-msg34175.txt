Can we include a small HTTP server (for .html + .js) into bitcoin? JSON-RPC
will only work on same domain + port.  

  
No, definitely not. But if somebody implements a nice Javascript GUI I'll
volunteer to teach bitcoin to spit out JSONP in addition to plain JSON to get
around the same origin policy...  
  
RE: GWT: I'd prefer a non-Java-to-Javascript-compiled solution (shipping
compiled, not-human-readable .js files makes me nervous; do we have to add all
the GWT compilation mechanism to the build process? Or do we have to trust
that you provided valid, not-messed-with, already-compiled .js files?)
