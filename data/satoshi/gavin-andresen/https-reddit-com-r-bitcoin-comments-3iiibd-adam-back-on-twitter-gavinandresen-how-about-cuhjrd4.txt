The simulation is for the "attack" scenario of a rogue miner intentionally creating slow-to-propagate blocks to try to attack other miners.

Propagation to the edges of the network doesn't matter (miners are very well connected).

And common case is instant propagation, because almost all transactions have already been propagated and the bulk of validation (e.g. signature checking) has already been done.
