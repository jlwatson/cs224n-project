Is there something simpler than CMake that would work?  
  
cmake-2.8.2.tar.gz - 5.1MB  
cmake-2.8.2-Darwin-universal.dmg - 27.2 MB  
  
Adding Yet Another Multi-Megabyte Dependency to build bitcoind seems like a
backwards step to me.  
  
What's the most popular build solution for other small-ish, successful open
source projects?
