Couldn't you almost instantly have a "non-trivial" amount of the network
converted by just getting [Tycho] and Slush (and maybe a couple other 500GH/s
+ pools) to have committed to being updated? And perhaps check with Vladimir
or a couple of the other big solo players?  

  
No, because you're probably not directly connected to those pools, and the
nodes you are connected to will drop transactions if they don't include the
'right' fee.

Also, on a side note, I would personally like to see the ability to include
smaller transactions in general included in a release very soon (at least 3
decimal places, preferably 4 especially if that is the transaction fee limit.
I think one should be able to see and work with those fractions of coins in
other ways as well if they can be used for fees.)  
  
That's my .0005 BTC.  

Bitcoin already supports showing and sending less-than-0.01 BTC amounts. It is
just smart and only shows 2 decimal places instead of always showing lots of
extra zeroes.
