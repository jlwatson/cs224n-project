What is the use case for this?  
  
Is it just to make it easier to send anonymous donations by typing in Pay To:
"redcross.org" instead of copying&pasting a bitcoin address?  
  
If something like that were implemented, seems like it would just invite the
same kind of abuse we see with misspelled-domain-squatters-- setup a domain
record for "redcros.org" pointing to a non-Red Cross bitcoin address and take
advantage of people's fat-fingered misspellings. One big advantage of bitcoin
addresses is that they have a built-in checksum, so if you misspell them (or
screw up the copy&paste) your attempted transaction will be immediately
rejected.
