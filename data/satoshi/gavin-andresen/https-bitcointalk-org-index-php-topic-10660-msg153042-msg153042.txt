Bitcoin isn't suited for transactions worth less than about one US penny-- it
wasn't designed or intended for lots of micro-transactions.  
  
That said, building a micro-transaction system on top of bitcoin is certainly
possibly (see witcoin or youtipit for some examples-- or see the way the
Bitcoin Faucet is handling payments recently, bundling up lots of small
transactions to send them without paying outrageous fees).
