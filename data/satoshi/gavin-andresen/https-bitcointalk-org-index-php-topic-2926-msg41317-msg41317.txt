ribuck: I did misunderstand, sorry.  
  
And maybe I should have been clearer: the idea behind a **reproducible**
virtual image is exactly to capture tools, version numbers, etc etc. Auditors
that create their own virtual images with the same CPU, OS, tools, etc. will
be relied upon to confirm that yes, the bitcoin executables on the website
were indeed built using standard compilers/linkers/etc from a particular
source revision.
