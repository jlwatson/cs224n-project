The next version of bitcoin allows for it and my request to remove merged
mining from git was rejected.  

  
kano, you seem to be under the mistaken impression that I am King of Bitcoin.  
  
I told you that if you don't like the getmemorypool RPC method, you would need
to gain consensus either on the Dev&Tech section of these forums or the
bitcoin-dev mailing list. That's how bitcoin works-- rough consensus, not
"submit requests to the King" or "petition the Central Committee."
