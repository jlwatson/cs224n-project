It is $150K/year, but the January/February/March paychecks were pegged to the price of bitcoin on January 1'st (policy was to peg once per quarter).

Those were very good months for Bitcoin, so Lindsay and I ended up getting big bonuses. And the Board decided that pegging every month was a better policy :-)

The 2014 form 990 will show me making $150K, unless the Board decides to cut my salary or give me a raise.
