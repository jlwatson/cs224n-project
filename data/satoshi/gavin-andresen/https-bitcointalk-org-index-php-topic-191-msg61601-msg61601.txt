RE: changing things now "just in case" :  
  
No, I think it would be dumb to switch hashing algorithms or public/private
keylengths now, for at least two reasons:  
  
1\. You'd just be switching from older technology that has the advantage of
being well-tested and "battle-hardened" to something newer that you THINK will
be more secure.  
  
2\. There are much more important things to work on. If you know enough about
crypto to evaluate whether Whirpool really is fundamentally more secure than
SHA-256, please apply your knowledge to the problems we have right now, like
making users' wallets more secure against trojans and malware...
