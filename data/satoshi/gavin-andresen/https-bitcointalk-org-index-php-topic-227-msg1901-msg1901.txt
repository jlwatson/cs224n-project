So, does running the bc agent, and then selling your bc's on BCM illegal?  
Or just, like madhatter's service, if he were in the states, unlicensed would
be illegal?  

I am not a lawyer.  
  
But if you generated bitcoins and then sold them I'd think you'd only done
something illegal when you fail to declare that income on your income tax
return. Just like if you grew tomatoes in your back yard and sold them to
somebody. You aren't likely to get into any trouble until you make a lot of
money on tomatoes and then fail to report that income to the IRS (or you get
shut down for farming in a residential zone or something).  
  
I think that applies to what madhatter is doing (taking payment for bitcoins
through the mail). But again, I am not a lawyer.
