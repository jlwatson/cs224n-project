design/implement a secure DNS-like "map string to bitcoin address" system (so
I can send bitcoins to "gavin@acm.org")  

This might be nice but I don't see it as a prerequisite for 1.0.  

  
I suppose if we figure out how to make click-to-pay work for both the "I'm
using an online wallet service" and the "I'm using the client" cases, then
users won't have to know how to copy&paste addresses and human-type-able
addresses won't be critical.  
  
RE: DoS resistance: please DO keep thinking about it; I'm not a networking
expert (in fact, if you know any networking experts, see if you can get them
thinking about it....).
