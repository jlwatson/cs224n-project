Bitcoin will get mentioned someplace with lots of readers, a bunch of those
readers will like the idea and try to buy Bitcoins, their price will rise
which will draw even more people to "invest", which will drive the price up
even more... until people decide that the price isn't going to rise any more
and everybody rushes to sell before the price drops. I predict there will be
between one and five Bitcoin bubbles (price will double or more and then crash
back down below the starting price) in the next four years .  

I'm resurrecting this old thread because I like to reality-check my
predictions.  
  
Number of bubbles so far: one.  
  
(the $0.008 to $0.014 price rise turned out not to be a bubble; the recent $10
to $30 back down under $10 was definitely a bubble)  
  
Zero to one bubbles and crashes per year for the next three years still seems
about right.
