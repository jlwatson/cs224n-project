I'm resurrecting this old thread because I like to reality-check my
predictions.  
  
Number of bubbles so far: one.  
  
(the $0.008 to $0.014 price rise turned out not to be a bubble; the recent $10
to $30 back down under $10 was definitely a bubble)  
  
Zero to one bubbles and crashes per year for the next three years still seems
about right.
