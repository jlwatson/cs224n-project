The password definitely shouldn't be required.  

I strongly disagree; software should be secure by default, and running
bitcoind without a password (or bitcoin -server) is definitely NOT secure.  
  
I just don't see somebody saying "Man, Bitcoin sucks because I have to add a
password to a configuration file before running it as a daemon." I **can** see
somebody saying "Man, Bitcoin sucks because I accidently ran it with the
-server switch and somebody stole all my money."
