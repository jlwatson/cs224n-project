Yes, partly.  
  
The most important change is having miners sort transactions by fee-per-
kilobyte, and prefer higher-fee transactions to lower-fee transactions. That
way users that want their transactions to get confirmed quickly can pay a
higher-than-average fee. Today, most miners are using the reference code which
selects transactions based on priority, not fee.  
  
Still todo: give better recommendations to users about how long it might take
their transaction to get confirmed if they send it without a fee, and
recommend an appropriate fee.
