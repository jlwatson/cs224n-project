Has anybody tried generating bitcoins on Amazon EC2 instances? If you have,
how many coins/day are you getting (and on what type of instance) ?  
  
If nobody has already, I might do some experimenting and get some back-of-the-
envelope estimates for $/bitcoin using Amazon EC2 spot instances.  
  
(I've had zero luck generating any coins over the last week on my couple-year-
old Macbook Pro, which only does 150-200K hashes per second)
