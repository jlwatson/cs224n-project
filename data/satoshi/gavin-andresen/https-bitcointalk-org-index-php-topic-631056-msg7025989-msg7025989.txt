  
The Bitcoin Foundation **does** help pay for dev efforts; it pays me,
Wladimir, and Cory Fields (and gives quarterly grants to fund other worthwhile
efforts).  
  
I disagree with the original poster; Bitcoin development is increasingly
decentralized over time. It started out as centralized as it could possibly
be-- Satoshi wrote all the code himself (or herself or their-selves).  
  
Now we have multiple implementations, multiple altcoins, and multiple wanna-
be-Bitcoin-2.0 contenders, all with their own dev person-or-team (well, some
altcoins probably don't have any developers).  
  
As for your specific ideas: go for it. If you think they're good ideas,
implement them (or hire or convince somebody to implement them) and see what
happens.
