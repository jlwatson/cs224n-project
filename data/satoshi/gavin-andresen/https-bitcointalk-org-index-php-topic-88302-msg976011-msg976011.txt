Chain proof-of-work is calculated based on the hash target, so if you get
another block at the same height there is no benefit to keeping the one with
"the smaller hash".  
  
Maybe if you receive a second block solution, keeping the block that removes
the most transactions from the memory pool would be the right "good for the
entire ecosystem" policy. That way even if small blocks propagate slightly
faster that might be offset if a larger, slower block was found. (but making
new-block-flooding independent of the size of the block is an even better
solution, and that shouldn't be too hard to implement)  
  
Creating a semi-trusted backbone of connections to other pools/miners so your
new blocks propagate quickly is a good idea.
