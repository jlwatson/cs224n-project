For the voting problem:  
  
It would probably be best to give each voter a "yes" and "no" address that
they are expected not to share with anybody else. They can then vote by
sending the right number of bitcoins to one of those addresses.  
  
You can decide what happens if they send to both addresses.  
  
If you want the vote results to be public, then you can pre-publish before the
vote a hash of the list of all addresses and voters. Then after the vote
publish the list; everybody can make sure it hashes to the correct value, that
it has the right list of voters, that it has twice as many addresses as
voters, and each voter can check to make sure the addresses assigned to them
are on the list.  
  
And the voters could then look at the transactions in the blockchain during
the voting period, to those addresses to audit the vote.  
  
There's probably a complicated crypto protocol you could put on top to make
the votes anonymous-but-verifiable, too -- so even the vote organizer doesn't
know who voted for what.
