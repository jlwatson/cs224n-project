RE: a be-safe thread for bitcoin: There are already a couple "be safe" threads
stickied in the Bitcoin Discussion forum (e.g. the beware of trojan wallet
stealers thread, the newbies article that links to keep-your-wallet-safe,
etc).  
  
Writing a more general one is not a bad idea; if I knew last November all the
craziness that would happen this year I would have written one back then (but
back then nobody was spending tens of thousands of dollars speculating on
bitcoin).  
  
RE: putting my employer in my forum signature: what do other people think?
Would that be unfair advertising for TruCoin or good full disclosure?  
  
If it drives more business to TruCoin then that will eventually, hopefully,
mean more money in my pocket, so if it is up to me heck yeah I'll mention
TruCoin in my signature!
