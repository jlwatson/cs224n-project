  
TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities), which are sold by
treasurydirect, compensate for inflation. They are a good place to put money
that you're pretty sure you will need "soon" -- within the next 5 years or so.
Assuming you trust the US government not to default on its debt (I do-- I
think the government might try to inflate away the debt, but won't outright
default).  
  
Money you won't need soon aught to be invested in something productive--
invest in some business or person that is making our lives more efficient or
pleasant. That should give you the best long-term return and will make the
world a better place, too. Stock market index funds are an inexpensive, mostly
safe, mostly inflation-proof way to invest.  
  
If you have some 'playing around' money that you can afford to lose, you might
want to invest in Bitcoins. But bitcoin is a startup currency, and should be
treated like a high-tech startup company-- high-risk, but very high potential
reward. You might lose your entire investment or it might turn out to be the
best investment you ever made.
