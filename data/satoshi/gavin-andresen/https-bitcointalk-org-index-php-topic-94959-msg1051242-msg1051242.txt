  
Yes-- bitcoind creates BIP16 multisig transactions (using BIP13 addresses).
Because a BIP16 transaction doesn't reveal public keys until the first spend,
if an attacker has only one of the public keys (and the multisig address has
been funded but never spent) they won't be able to figure out that the key is
helping to protect a large multisig-protected balance.
