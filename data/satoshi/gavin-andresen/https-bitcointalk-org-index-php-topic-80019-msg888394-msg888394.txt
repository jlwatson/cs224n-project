@luke-jr : I don't want to start an argument, but I still think we don't have
enough testing resources to support 4 releases. I think we need to establish
good QA for the main Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind release before we worry about next-
test or so-called-"stable" releases.  
  
That's a good discussion for the Testing Project team to have, though, once it
gets up and running a little more.  
  
I'd also like the Testing Project to not get pigeonholed into "QA testing for
Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind", but to tackle cross-implementation compatibility (which
I think is the next big, critical issue).
