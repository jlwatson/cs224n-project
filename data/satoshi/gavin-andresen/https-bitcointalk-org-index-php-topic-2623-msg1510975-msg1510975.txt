I'm of the opinion that bitcoind/Bitcoin-Qt shouldn't be pushed to the
central/canonical repos until we hit version 1.0.  
  
Until then, I think we change too much too often (e.g. the blockchain format
completely changed in the 0.8 release, and the wallet format will likely be
changed before we hit version 1.0).
