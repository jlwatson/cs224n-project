I mostly work in C#, but I'm sure its true for other languages too, creating a
data structure that you can deserialize an array of different types into, and
easily work with is...painful.  

Excellent point. I use python, which just works with different types in
arrays, and C++/json_spirit, which also just works, but I can that other
languages would be painful.  
  
I'll go through the raw transactions API and will replace any "Array of
different types" with "Array of Objects".
