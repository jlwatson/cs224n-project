Can we come up with a scheme that uses 2-of-3 that solves the problem?  
  
  
Key 1 is the Wallet Protection Service Key. Your wallet only knows the public
half of that key.  
  
Create two random keys, Key 2 and Key 3, offline. Save them, they're needed
for backup.  
Transfer the private part of Key 2 and just the public half of Key 3 to the
online wallet.  
  
The wallet can generate the 2-of-3 required bitcoin payment address (it has
all 3 public keys), but can only sign for Key 2.  
  
Normally, it will ask the wallet protection service to sign for Key 1.  
  
If the WPS goes out of business, the private key for Key3 can be imported and
the wallet will be able to spend without the WPS.  
If the online wallet gets lost AND the WPS goes out of business, then Key2 and
Key3 can be restored from the offline backup.

If you care about privacy and want to make it harder for people to track your
transactions, then you could implement a deterministic key scheme on top of
all of that-- start with keys 1, 2 and 3 and ECC multiply them by some random
number to get derived keys. The random number would need to be stored with the
backup, in the online wallet, and sent to the wallet protection service, but
that's OK because you need the random number plus 2 of the 3 secret keys to
spend the coins.
