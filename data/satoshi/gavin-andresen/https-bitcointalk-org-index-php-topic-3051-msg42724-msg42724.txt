Yea, that's nice, but will we reset the main network the day someone pulls the
same trick on it ?  

  
No, if necessary we'd change the difficulty adjustment rules and make the
code:  
  
if (current block is > some_number)  
... new rules for adjusting difficulty  
else  
... old rules for adjusting difficulty  
  
I could have done that and kept the testnet block chain, but it is cleaner to
just reset it with new rules.  
  
And "pulling the same trick" means throwing an overwhelmingly massive amount
of hashing power at the main network (like 16 times the current overall
hashing power) for a significant amount of time, which is getting increasingly
hard to do.
