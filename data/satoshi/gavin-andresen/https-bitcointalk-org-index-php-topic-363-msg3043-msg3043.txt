Very good point about the genesis block.  
  
Unfortunately, I'm not exactly sure HOW to generate a valid genesis block; I
can tweak the data but need to generate a valid block hash... hmm, I see some
time in gdb in my near future...  
  
RE: changing the protocol version: Good Idea, too. Every wire protocol message
starts with the bytes '{ 0xf9, 0xbe, 0xb4, 0xd9 }', I'll tweak that in the
TEST code so TEST and production clients can't talk to each other even if they
manage to get connected.
