The only reason to limit the block size is to subsidize non-Bitcoin currencies
or to insulate existing miners from future competition.

  
I think this is exactly right.  
  
But I also think that choosing a larger-but-still-limited block size won't
kill Bitcoin (but not raising the block size at all might-- a payment system
with a hard seven-transactions-per-second limit is not Satoshi's vision).
