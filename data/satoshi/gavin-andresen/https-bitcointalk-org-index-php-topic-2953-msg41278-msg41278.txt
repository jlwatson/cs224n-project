Will be _-rescan_ option in GUI?  

  
No. Unless you're changing your wallet outside of bitcoin, rescanning isn't
necessary.  
  
It would be nice if the GUI had "backup wallet" and "merge backed up wallet
with current wallet" options-- the "merge wallet" would need do a rescan.
Maybe next release somebody will implement those features...
