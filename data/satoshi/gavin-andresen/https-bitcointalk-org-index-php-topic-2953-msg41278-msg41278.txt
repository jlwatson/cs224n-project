  
No. Unless you're changing your wallet outside of bitcoin, rescanning isn't
necessary.  
  
It would be nice if the GUI had "backup wallet" and "merge backed up wallet
with current wallet" options-- the "merge wallet" would need do a rescan.
Maybe next release somebody will implement those features...
