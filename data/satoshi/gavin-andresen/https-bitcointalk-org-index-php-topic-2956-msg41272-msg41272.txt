getinfo and getbalance (with no arguments)... are a little complicated.  
  
They include all 1 confirmation receive transactions, but (this is the
complicated part) they also include 0-confirmation receives if they are self-
sends (either the "change" from coins you just sent or all the coins if you
sent to one of your own addresses).  
  
In any case, I think they will do exactly what you want-- show you coins that
have at least one confirmation or that you are certain you are able to spend
(because they are your own 0-confirmation coins).
