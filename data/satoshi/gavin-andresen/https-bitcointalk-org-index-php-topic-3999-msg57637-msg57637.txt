Would it help if you restructured that way payments were sent so that it
wouldn't always be new coins from the change of the last transaction? Like
maybe break your stash into a bunch of .05 addresses and let them age and then
you can send them out with no change?  

  
No. The only way to "break your stash" is to create transactions that are
broadcast; splitting your wallet into lots of small transactions makes the
problem worse for you and everybody else (it is more 'expensive' to handle
fistfulls of nickels and pennies, even in the bitcoin world).
