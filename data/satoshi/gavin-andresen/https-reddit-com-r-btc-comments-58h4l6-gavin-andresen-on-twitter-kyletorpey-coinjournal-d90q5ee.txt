Wrong about what?

In my opinion your tweet was misleading (the via @CoinCenter, since all the content was from the coin telegraph interview).

And in my opinion the reporting was lazy, since all you did was listen to the podcast and regurgitate a few bits (and didn't bother to do any primary source reporting).

I've seen two arguments that I'm wrong:

1. It is standard practice. This is the 'it is ok because everybody does it' argument.

2. It is ok because the content is good. This is 'the ends justifies the means.'

Yeah... no.
