Nice analysis! I'm tempted to put a link to your post in the code as a
comment...  
  
The whole transaction prioritization scheme was written by Satoshi after I
suggested that de-prioritizing "small new" transactions might help the
spamming problem. In the last couple of days we've exchanged email about
possibly modifying it; pull request 88 is the first suggested change (it makes
the CreateTransaction fee calculations match the CreateBlock calculations).  
  
Until somebody finishes implementing lightweight 'headers-only block
download', we should try to keep block size small-- otherwise new users will
have to wait an even longer time before being able to use bitcoin.  
  
Also: the Faucet is now paying a 0.01 BTC fee per transaction. With the
CreateTransaction fix, it probably would be anyway (the transactions it
creates look very spammy).
