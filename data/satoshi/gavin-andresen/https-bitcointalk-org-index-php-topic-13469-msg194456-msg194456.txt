I'll confess: the bitcoin GUI is not a high development priority for me
because I think downloading and running software on your computer will soon be
almost extinct.  
  
I expect pretty soon most people will be using bitcoin through web
applications (like mybitcoin or instawallet) or as apps running on their
mobile phones.  
  
I'll also confess that I like the bittorrent model-- create a great
technology, a "good enough" interface for it, and encourage the creation of
compatible applications that have great user interfaces.
