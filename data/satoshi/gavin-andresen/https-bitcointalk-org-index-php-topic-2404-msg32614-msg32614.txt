How would look multitransaction with several entries of identical addresses
with identical amounts? How they will be different for JSON client?  

  
They won't be different-- you will get two entries that are identical.  
  
Bitcoin will sum them up for you if you use the getbalance or getreceivedby*
RPC commands.
