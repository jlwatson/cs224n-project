People will look back and say "Wow Bitcoin has been around 10 years". 17
million coins issued and the project continues. IMHO Bitcoin is a long road.
Barring something technically superior (and no Mintchip isn't it) time is on
the side of Bitcoin. Time will increase adoption, time will increase "faith"
in the value as a medium of exchange.

I still expect it to be a long and very bumpy road, but as long as the system
keeps chugging away reliably processing transactions I think it will, overall,
in the long run, gain more and more trust.
