Obstacle / factor: getting to where people are earning Bitcoin directly, instead of having to jump through some hoop to trade the currency that they earn for BTC.

Bitcoin in five years:  uhhh.... 2019....  I left my crystal ball in my other coat pocket.

I think it'll either disappear and become an under-the-covers ledger system that Joe-ordinary-consumer never sees.

Or it will be the de-facto currency of the Internet (prices still quoted in your local currency, but payment in Bitcoin always accepted).

RE: senior school project: sure, email me questions. Please don't be too sad if I answer you with "sorry, can't, too busy this week."
