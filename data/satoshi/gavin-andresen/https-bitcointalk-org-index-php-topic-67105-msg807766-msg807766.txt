  
How are signatures created when the phone or computer needs to spend some
coins?  
  
I'm told it IS possible to break a single ECDSA key in half and then have a
complete signature generated without either device ever knowing the entire
key, but, if I recall correctly, the solution involves several communication
round trips between the devices and some very sophisticated cryptography. The
multikey solution is much simpler.  
  
If I'm wrong, then great! The single ECDSA key solution will get adopted for
wallet security and multisigs will only be used for escrow.  
  
RE: makku's question "How do you identify transactions that belong to you in
the first place?"  
  
I think it is wrong to think of coins involved in a multiparty multisignature
transaction as "belonging to you." They don't belong to you-- you have to
agree and cooperate with other keyholder(s) for the transaction to be spent.  
  
You are _involved_ in the transaction, but you need some extra information
that isn't in the blockchain to know how you are involved (are you an
arbitrator? a person getting paid? a person paying somebody? something else?).
