Network bandwidth is growing too, although probably not as fast. So this is
still a realistic concern.  

  
Network bandwidth is currently growing about 20% per year, or roughly doubling
every four years.  
  
Satoshi's original code had a 32MB block size limit, which he dropped to 1MB
as part of a bunch of band-aid fixes to make denial-of-service attacks harder.  
  
RE: density of full nodes: In my opinion, if it is affordable to run a full
node (less than, say, $100 per month in server costs-- that is a trivial
monthly cost for most businesses and some individuals) then we'll continue to
see tens of thousands of full nodes.  
  
Median cost of a dedicated server with lots of bandwidth, disk and CPU is
under $100/month these days, which would support a block size at least ten
times the current maximum.  
  
And all of THAT is before even starting to think about possible optimizations
(e.g. figure out how to mitigate the "insert malicious data" problem-- maybe
Peter Todd's security bonds would be helpful-- and a shared DHT storing all
valid transactions combined with bloom filters on connections could make it
cheap for any one machine to be a fully validating node).  
  
Please, don't listen to all of the FUD being thrown around about raising the
block size even before there is any solid proposal for what should be done.
