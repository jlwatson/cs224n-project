But, use of HTTP-Basic is just a crime, because it is so trivial to obtain the
shared secret. If HTTP-Basic is to be kept, at least require SSL connections?  

It isn't trivial to obtain the secret unless you patch the code to bind to
interfaces other than loopback....  
  
SSL connections are The Right Answer.  
  
If I had any OpenSSL programming experience I'd volunteer to implement it.
Anybody willing and able to teach bitcoin to speak https?  
  
And for extra credit, support SSL client certificates for authentication
either instead of or in addition to HTTP-Basic...
