Now I remember why I added the option: doesn't the internal miner call
CheckWork() if 16 bits are zeroes? ie. this message would be printed a lot for
the internal miner, if added unconditionally, right?  

  
That's what I meant when I asked "are there significant costs?"  
  
If one of the mining pool folks think this would be useful in a production
miner, then I see the value. If it is only really useful if you're trying to
debug a remote miner that isn't working quite right...
