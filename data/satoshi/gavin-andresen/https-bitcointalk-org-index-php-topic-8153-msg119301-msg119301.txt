Oh, and what version of bitcoin are you running? 0.3.21 includes a patch from
luke-jr that modifies the coin-selection algorithm to avoid sub-cent change
when possible.  
  
It will also help if you keep a good selection of 'old' coins in the shared
wallet.  
  
I agree that transaction fee accounting/handling needs improvement.
