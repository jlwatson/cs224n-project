For the record:  
  
I think testing a gazillion pulls at once is madness, because if something
doesn't work it can be incredibly difficult to figure out which of the
gazillion changes made it break. Assuming that just once change made it break
and not some subtle interaction between two or three or six changes...  
  
If you want to help test, I think it would be much more helpful if you find a
feature you care about, grab the binaries that the pull-tester creates, test
thoroughly, and then report results in the pull request on github.
