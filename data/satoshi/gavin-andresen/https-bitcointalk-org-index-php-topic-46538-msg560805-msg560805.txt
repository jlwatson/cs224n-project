If Satoshi didn't intend for anything like this to be added, he wouldn't have
had a reason to implement a scripting engine in the first place. Transactions
would just have "inputs" and "outputs" and nothing more.  

  
He wouldn't have included NOP1 through NOP10, either.  
  
I file this under "Satoshi is a genius, part 9,432". It gives a smooth upgrade
path using the same blockchain if ECDSA or SHA256 start to get fragile.  
  
Attacking old clients by sending them coins with "will-never-be-satisfied-but-
they-can't-tell-that" inputs **is** a concern-- it is basically the Finney
attack, but anybody will be able to try to pull it off and there is no time
constraint.  
  
However, I think the benefits of being able to send to a truly secure address
**FAR** outweigh the risks, I don't think it will be difficult to get people
to upgrade to a newer, more secure client, and accepting 0- or 1-confirmation
transactions is always a bad idea.  
  
I also think you're exaggerating the impact-- OP_EVAL does not invalidate all
of the security review that has been done so far, especially if the scripting
language being EVAL'ed is unchanged from what we have today.
