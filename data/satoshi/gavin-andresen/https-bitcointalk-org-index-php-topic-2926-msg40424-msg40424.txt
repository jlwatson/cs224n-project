It is time to build and test a new version of bitcoin.  
  
In the past, Satoshi built the Windows and Linux releases, Laszlo built the
Mac releases, and we trusted them not to put malware in them (or we compiled
ourself from source).  
  
Satoshi is busy, and even if he wasn't he shouldn't be spending his time doing
a job that a lot of the rest of us are capable of doing. So we need a new
process.  
  
Ideally, that process should be open and verifiably trustworthy. So I'd like
to propose that we do the following:  
  
1\. For each platform, somebody creates a pristine, reproducible build
environment, preferably as a virtual machine image that anybody can download,
inspect, clone, run, etc.  
  
Anybody should be able to reproduce the build environment by running or
following a script (e.g. "Install Ubuntu X.Y.Z. apt-get the following versions
of the following packages... etc").  
  
2\. A copy of that virtual machine is used to build/package the release.  
  
3\. Anybody can audit the process by re-creating the build environment and
ensuring that they end up with "identical" executables. (where "identical"
means compare the code in the executables, ignoring timestamps or other meta-
info linkers put into executables -- are there already tools to do that, or do
we need to roll our own?).  
  
Feedback? Suggestions for improvement, or are there better ways of creating
'trusted builds' ?
