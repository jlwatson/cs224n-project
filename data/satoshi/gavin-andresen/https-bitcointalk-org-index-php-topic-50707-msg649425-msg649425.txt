I dont' see the OP_EVAL nor OP_NOP1 in this block ?  
And how many pools is supporting this "OP_EVAL"?  

  
These bytes at the end of the coinbase: 074f505f4556414c  
... are the 7-character string "OP_EVAL" (07 is the length, 4f is the letter
O, etc).  
  
There are no OP_EVAL transactions in that block; it isn't safe to send OP_EVAL
transactions until after a majority of miners support it.  
  
I believe Eligius is the only pool supporting OP_EVAL right now; Tycho of
DeepBit has finished integrating the backport and has said he'll start
supporting it after more testing, before the end of this month. Last I heard
slush was also working on supporting it.
