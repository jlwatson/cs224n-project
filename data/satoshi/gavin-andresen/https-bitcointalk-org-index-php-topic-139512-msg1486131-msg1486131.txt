I guess if about 20 people all said "I have something that needs a provable
trust-free timestamp _right now_ , and it would be worth 5 cents to me if you
would finish your service so I can use it tomorrow" to me, I'd get mine ready
for public consumption and announce it here.  

  
I'd just point them to http://www.timemarker.org/
