OK that's pretty much what I was talking about then. So my stupidly small
transaction at the moment won't be accepted by most miners, which means it
wont get recorded in the block chain which means it wont happen, right?  

  
Yes, and right now it will sit in your wallet at 0 confirmations and get
rebroadcast once in a blue moon (ok, not that long, but I'm too lazy right now
to dig out the rules for when transactions are rebroadcast) until it DOES make
it into a block.  
  
And you'll have to hack your copy of bitcoin to be able to send a less-
than-.01 transaction without a fee; the RPC send* methods automatically add
the fee, and the GUI will tell you a fee is necessary (and won't let you send
unless you agree to it).
