The plan is the same as before: EFF coins will be redistributed via the
Bitcoin Faucet.  
  
Last week the folks at the EFF said they'd be sending the coins to a secure
wallet I created for that purpose "tomorrow."  
I asked that they send them to address: 1vc3ZU4ae2cF6ZxqE44j5Ak3wfsZqybtb  
  
I'll let you know what happens; they never told me where the coins are being
held, it is possible they got caught in the mybitcoin disaster.  
  
I'll keep that wallet secure and offline except to periodically top-up the
Faucet's balance.
