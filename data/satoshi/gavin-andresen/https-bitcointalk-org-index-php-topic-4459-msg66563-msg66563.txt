  
Yeah... I can imagine clever ways of obfuscating it such that you can't tell
who's getting paid until they actually sign the transaction and spend the
output. Make the txout something like:  

Code:

OP_OVER OP_HASH160 OP_XOR <hash160_xor_r1> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG  

... and to spend the txin is: <scriptsig> <public_key> <r1> (where r1 is a
random number used to obfuscate the publicly visible hash160). Or something
like that (I shouldn't be thinking about cryptography when I'm this tired).
