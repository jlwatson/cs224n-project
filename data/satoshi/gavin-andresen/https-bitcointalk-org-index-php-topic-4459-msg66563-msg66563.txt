Can't you work out how many order and the value the merchant was getting just
by looking in the block chain at the number and value of payments to the
publicly posted "pay me" address? Surely there's no way around this other than
the merchant using a new receiving address for every sale he makes?  

  
Yeah... I can imagine clever ways of obfuscating it such that you can't tell
who's getting paid until they actually sign the transaction and spend the
output. Make the txout something like:  

Code:

OP_OVER OP_HASH160 OP_XOR <hash160_xor_r1> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG  

... and to spend the txin is: <scriptsig> <public_key> <r1> (where r1 is a
random number used to obfuscate the publicly visible hash160). Or something
like that (I shouldn't be thinking about cryptography when I'm this tired).
