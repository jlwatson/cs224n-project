  
Yes, that is what I am saying.  
  
"Safer" : there are two competing threats here: raise the block size too
slowly and you discourage transactions and increase their price. The danger is
Bitcoin becomes irrelevant for anything besides huge transactions, and is used
only by big corporations and is too expensive for individuals. Hurray, we just
reinvented the SWIFT or ACH systems.  
  
Raise it too quickly and it gets too expensive for ordinary people to run full
nodes.  
  
So I'm saying: the future is uncertain, but there is a clear trend. Lets
follow that trend, because it is the best predictor of what will happen that
we have.  
  
If the experts are wrong, and bandwidth growth (or CPU growth or memory growth
or whatever) slows or stops in ten years, then fine: change the largest-
block-I'll-accept formula. Lowering the maximum is easier than raising it
(lowering is a soft-forking change that would only affect stubborn miners who
insisted on creating larger-than-what-the-majority-wants blocks).  
  
  
RE: a quick fix like doubling the size:  
  
Why doubling? Please don't be lazy, at least do some back-of-the-envelope
calculations to justify your numbers (to save you some work: the average
Bitcoin transaction is about 250 bytes big). The typical broadband home
internet connection can support much larger blocks today.
