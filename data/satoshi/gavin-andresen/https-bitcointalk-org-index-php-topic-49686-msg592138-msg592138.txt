There's nothing wrong with trading Bitcoins, just like there's nothing wrong
with exchanging USD to EUR to buy a glass of wine.  

  
Yes, but if you are spending a lot of time or effort trying to make money on
an essentially unproductive activity then I think you should ask yourself if
there's something else you could be doing that would be more effective at
making the world a better place.  
  
I think a lot of buy-low-sell-high, there-is-always-a-bigger-fool, or high-
frequency trading fits into the "isn't making the world a better place"
category. If you're competing for a bigger slice of a fixed-sized pie, I think
you should think hard about what you could do instead to make the pie bigger
for everybody.  
  
Mmmm.... pie......
