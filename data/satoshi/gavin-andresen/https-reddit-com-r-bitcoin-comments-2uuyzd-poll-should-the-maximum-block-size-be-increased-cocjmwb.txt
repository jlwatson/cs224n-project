The data I'm working from:  testing with my 3-year-old Mac, assuming a "pretty good" broadband Internet connection (300GB per month data cap), and assuming only half the bandwidth is used for Bitcoin.

And going with historical estimates of growth in bandwidth, storage and CPU (bandwidth is the bottleneck, growing 50% per year).

I'm happy to implement another method of implementing the fork-- picking a block number or date N months out would be just fine. I think it still makes sense to ask miners to produce block.version=4 blocks, because that will trigger automatic warnings asking people to upgrade.
