Problem with a vote is that it brings bureaucraty in the system. Peole will
have to register to github, remember to participate to the votes, check on
regular basis for new votes, and so on. I don't like that. Democracy doesn't
fit cyberspace well, imo. I very much prefer anarchy.  

  
Umm... there will be no Top Bureaucrat counting votes and telling people what
to do. There will still be plenty of anarchy, I promise!  
  
Use the voting system to express what is important to YOU.  
  
Or not.
