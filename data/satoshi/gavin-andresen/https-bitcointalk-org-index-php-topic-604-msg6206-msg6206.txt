I get:  

Code:

/var/folders/n7/n7Do3Krz2RWPeE+1YxvhUU+++TM/-Tmp-//cc8PgHsQ.s:879:suffix or
operands invalid for `call'  

... compiling cryptopp/sha.cpp (latest SVN source) on my Mac (gcc version
4.2.1).  
  
I fixed it by adding -DCRYPTOPP_DISABLE_ASM to my makefile; perhaps somebody
with more experience compiling C++ on a Mac can figure out a better fix.
