Perhaps you could explain why the Foundation was originally registered in
Carmel IN and is now defunct.  
  
Current Information  
Entity Legal Name:  
BITCOIN FOUNDATION INC.  
Status: Voluntarily Dissolved  
Entity Type: Non-Profit Domestic Corporation  
  
Entity Creation Date: 9/13/2011  
Entity Date to Expire:  
Entity Inactive Date: 3/28/2013  
  
Also would you care to explain why two men, Andrew Lee and Steve Deprospero,
both with affiliations to MtGox are listed as agent and principles in the
corporate entry?  
  
Continuing with the transparency theme,  
  
Maybe you could shed some light on the new Foundation registered in Seattle WA
and known as THE BITCOIN FOUNDATION, INC. DBA THE BITCOIN FOUNDATION  
  
Why is a wedding photographer named Daryl Garmon listed as Special Address
Information using a Seattle PO Box?  
  
Special Address Information  
Address PO Box 31671  
City Seattle  
State WA  
Zip 98103  

  
Let me guess, you think 9/11 was an inside job by the Bush administration and
we never sent a man to the moon?  
  
This is exactly why I don't come here much any more, and exactly why the
Foundation forums are real-name-only, member-only. None of us have time to
respond to all the tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy-mongering (I don't remember
why "Bitcoin Foundation" was originally a legal entity in the midwest;
something about an aborted previous attempt to get one started by... maybe Mt.
Gox? who cares? why does that matter? focus on the present and future, stop
worrying about how things weren't done perfectly in the past exactly how you
wanted them to happen).  
  
Sigh. Ok, I'm going to go back to my default "don't feed the trolls" now, and
actually get some work done.
