  
Let me guess, you think 9/11 was an inside job by the Bush administration and
we never sent a man to the moon?  
  
This is exactly why I don't come here much any more, and exactly why the
Foundation forums are real-name-only, member-only. None of us have time to
respond to all the tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy-mongering (I don't remember
why "Bitcoin Foundation" was originally a legal entity in the midwest;
something about an aborted previous attempt to get one started by... maybe Mt.
Gox? who cares? why does that matter? focus on the present and future, stop
worrying about how things weren't done perfectly in the past exactly how you
wanted them to happen).  
  
Sigh. Ok, I'm going to go back to my default "don't feed the trolls" now, and
actually get some work done.
