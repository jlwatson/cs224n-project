The windows setup.exe is signed, as is the Mac .app bundle. The executables
inside them are not signed (I can't think of a good reason to sign them, it
would not increase download security at all).  
  
You can also still check the download packages using the SHASUMS.asc file,
which is signed with my gpg key.  
  
And if you are running Linux or Windows you could check all of the files in
the installer against other core developer's keys.  
  
If the code signing certificate was revoked then we would go back to just
using gpg keys. The code signing certificate is great because Windows and OSX
know how to check it automatically when the download happens.
