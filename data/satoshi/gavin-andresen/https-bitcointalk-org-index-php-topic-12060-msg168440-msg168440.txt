A huge block-chain re-org on the testnet confused the heck out of the testnet
faucet (leaving it with lots of 0-confirmation, used-to-be-valid sends that
made it think it had a negative balance).  
  
Clearing its wallet of the 0-confirmation transaction fixed it, but left it
with a very small balance. It is up and running (at
https://testnet.freebitcoins.appspot.com/ ), but if you generated a bunch of
testnet coins, please send some to the testnet faucet at
miGuMc6qtVEKS6Pf1jKddaa81DeHjMzkpB .  
  
Also, for anybody who doesn't know about it already: I've been using testnet-
in-a-box (thanks Mike!) very successfully for testing. It gives you a nice,
well-defined, controlled environment for reproducing bugs. Get it from:
