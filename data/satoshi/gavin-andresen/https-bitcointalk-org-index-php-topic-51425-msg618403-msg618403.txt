Huh what? Version 0.5 supports drag-and-drop of bitcoin: URIs. And there's a
pull request pending for click-to-pay support.  
  
  
One fear is bitcoin-address-rewriting malware, like the URL-rewriting phishing
malware we have today. Actually, combining the two would be very effective
(direct the user to a phishing site where all the bitcoin: URIs pay or donate
to the scammers). We need better ways users can be certain they are paying who
they think they are paying.
