Ay carumba, how did we not notice that for over two years?  
  
I introduced that bug with the 'sendmany' command two years ago (commit
b9d1ed85). This is why programmers should not be trusted to test their own
code (I probably carefully tested to make sure the change position looked
random when I send to more than one destination, and never tested the
degenerate send-to-one case; sigh).
