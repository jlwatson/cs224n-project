  
So if the merchant sees an attempted double-spend within 5 seconds they accept
the bitcoins but don't give the merchandise/service/whatever.  
  
That sounds like a good idea to me. Maybe instead of 5 seconds it aught to be
"before the transaction is fully confirmed."  
  
The only drawback I see is buggy clients that might have bugs that cause
'honest' double-spending mistakes.  
  
Oh, and merchants would have to explain to customers whey they kept their
double-spent coins (although the merchants could easily produce both
transaction IDs to show the world that it WAS a double-spend, so they
shouldn't have to worry about their reputation being sullied).
