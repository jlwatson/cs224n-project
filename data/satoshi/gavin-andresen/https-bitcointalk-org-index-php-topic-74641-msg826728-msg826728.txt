We updated the translations and fixed two serious-enough-to-be-showstopper
bugs, and 0.6 release candidate 6 is available at:  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.6.0/  
  
The two bugs (both caused by changes between release candidates 4 and 5, of
course!) were:  
  
1\. Creating over a gigabyte of transaction logs during initial blockchain
download. You should now see both a fast download and no more than 120MB of
log files created.  
  
2\. A few people upgrading from previous releases couldn't get past the
'loading addr.dat' phase of startup.  
  
I hope to repackage this as the final 0.6.0 release tomorrow; if you can help
sanity test, please do!
