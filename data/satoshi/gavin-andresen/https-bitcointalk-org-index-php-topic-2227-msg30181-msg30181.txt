I posted a huge reply to a previous post explaining exactly this...  
I also mentioned an attack that hasn't been discussed. If my post was deleted
could a mod explain why? And/or let other people know about the attack so it
could be discussed as necessary?  

  
I deleted two posts-- one from you that was a quote of ByteCoin's simulation
results (and nothing else).  
  
And a second from ByteCoin (if I recall correctly), saying essentially "what's
up with the empty post?"
