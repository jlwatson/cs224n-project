I'm thoroughly confused on what, exactly, you're proposing.  
  
I want to make a 100 Bitcoin transaction to you.  
  
You're proposing that I need to pay a "transmit fee" ... which is paid to who
and does what, exactly?  
  
If I pay it to A, B, and C, does that mean they rebroadcast the transaction to
everybody they're connected to? Do they, in turn, pay transmit fees to the
nodes they're rebroadcast it to? What stops them from saying "Thank you very
much for the transmit fee" and cheating (drop my transaction on the floor)?  
  
Satoshi's proposal that all transaction carry a minimum fee to cover network
overhead makes sense; whoever generates the block with the transaction gets
the fee.
