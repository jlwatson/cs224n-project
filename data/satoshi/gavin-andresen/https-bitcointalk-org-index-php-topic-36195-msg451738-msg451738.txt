Two different encryption schemes and/or passwords seems like a bad idea to me,
both from a code maintenance/security point of view and from a usability
point-of-view.  
  
Can you expand on "private keys in base-58 export format are great for
swapping around" -- what's the use case? Who are you swapping with, and how?
