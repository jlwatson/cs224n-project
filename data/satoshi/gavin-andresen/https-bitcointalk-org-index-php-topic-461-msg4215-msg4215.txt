The Bitcoin Faucets (production and TEST) are now running with this change.  
  
I was confused for a bit because the password is given LAST on the command
line, but FIRST in the JSON-RPC params list. I agree that reading the command-
line password from a file would be more convenient and more secure.  
  
I'll try to do some research on how other projects tackle JSON-RPC
authentication.
