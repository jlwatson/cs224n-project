Limit-per-ip-range is an interesting idea.  
  
I'd like to give the current not-yet-released solution a month or two to work
before trying something else. I see two possible directions:  
  
\+ Limit-per-{connection,ip-range}. Trouble with this is an attacker who has
multiple IPs (think botnet operator) can mount a distributed flood attack.  
  
or/and  
  
\+ Take transaction priority into account when deciding what to drop.  
  
I'd really like to talk to a p2p network researcher; it seems to me it might
be possible to keep some statistics on what "typical" bitcoin network traffic
looks like; perhaps nodes could drop neighbors if they notice network traffic
from them looks way out of whack (e.g. sending a much-larger-than-typical
number of addr messages or free transactions or...).
