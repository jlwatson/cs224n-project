Securities scares me because in the USA there are strict laws with even
TALKING about securities.  
  
I know, I know, Congress is supposed to make no law abridging freedom of
speech. I worry that won't stop the SEC from seizing the bitcointalk.org
domain name for promoting unlicensed securities.  
  
I think a separate top-level domain for everything under the Marketplace
heading would be the right thing to do.
