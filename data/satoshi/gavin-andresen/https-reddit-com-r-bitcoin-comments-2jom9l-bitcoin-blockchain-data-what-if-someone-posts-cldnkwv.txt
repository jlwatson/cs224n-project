Someone already did. Nothing much happened.

You might as well ask: what if I set my web browser's user agent to some illegal information and then visit a bunch of websites? I can bring the whole internet down because server logs all over the world will be illegal!!!!!! 

Yeah, no, doesn't work that way. The legal system learned 'don't feed the trolls' long ago.
