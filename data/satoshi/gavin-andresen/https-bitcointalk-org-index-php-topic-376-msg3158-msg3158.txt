That's right.  
  
One of Bitcoin's big advantages is that you can be your own bank; you don't
have to trust a government-backed fractional reserve bank to keep your extra
cash safe.  
  
If you WANT to trust a fractional-reserve Bitcoin Bank, feel free. But don't
go crying to your congressman if you lose all your money, please.
