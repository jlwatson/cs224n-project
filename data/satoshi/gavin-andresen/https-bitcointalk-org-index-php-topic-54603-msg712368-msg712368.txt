  
Huh? GIT HEAD bitcoind supports import private key functionality:  

Code:

importprivkey <bitcoinprivkey> {label}

  
Whether or not that's ever supported by the GUI is a different issue, and
there I think we SHOULD be more concerned about people using the GUI shooting
themselves in their feet.
