I was really looking forward to the import feature in bitcoind (don't care
about sweep). Too bad the developers decided to be nanny for us.  

  
Huh? GIT HEAD bitcoind supports import private key functionality:  

Code:

importprivkey <bitcoinprivkey> {label}

  
Whether or not that's ever supported by the GUI is a different issue, and
there I think we SHOULD be more concerned about people using the GUI shooting
themselves in their feet.
