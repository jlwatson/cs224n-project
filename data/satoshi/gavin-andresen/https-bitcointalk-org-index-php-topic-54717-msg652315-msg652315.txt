Yes, those are both my PGP keys. I generated a new, stronger key yesterday
(1FC7...) that I intend to use for code signing for the next release. I
thought I'd changed the gavinandresen.asc file on bitcoin.org to contain both
keys, but it looks like I didn't (or pgp/gpg doesn't allow more than one key
in the .asc file; I was disappointed to learn that gpg doesn't support putting
multiple signatures in an .asc file...)
