GPG signature bitcoin-0.5.1-macosx.dmg.asc tells me that
bitcoin-0.5.1-macosx.dmg is correctly signed by key BE38D3A8, but on
bitcoin.org the "PGP" link next to Gavin's name gives me a public key
1FC730C1. I just wanted to confirm that both of those keys in fact belong to
Gavin.  

Yes, those are both my PGP keys. I generated a new, stronger key yesterday
(1FC7...) that I intend to use for code signing for the next release. I
thought I'd changed the gavinandresen.asc file on bitcoin.org to contain both
keys, but it looks like I didn't (or pgp/gpg doesn't allow more than one key
in the .asc file; I was disappointed to learn that gpg doesn't support putting
multiple signatures in an .asc file...)
