Y'all probably want this:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/491  
  
However, I don't think you can fix all the problems that a fixed transaction
fee cause; the real problem is that basic economics says that you need to let
the price of a scare resource change, ideally in a market, to match the
underlying real costs.  
  
(bitcoin's fee structure isn't right either, and fixing it to create a market
between miners and clients is high on the TODO list)
