Today: a brand-new keypair (address) is created and added to your wallet when
you have change.  
  
Soon (I hope; I _think_ satoshi is working on it...) bitcoin will pre-generate
a bunch of addresses to use for change, and use one of them (and re-generate a
bunch when it runs out).  
  
I'd kind of like an option to put change back into one of the addresses it
came from; that'd be simpler, quicker, and would make your wallet smaller...
