Optimizing the accounts code to add a berkeley db index table that indexed
wallet transactions by account, and that cached account balances (and
invalidated or updated the cache on receive/send) shouldn't be terribly hard
for somebody who already knows c++ and berkeley db.  
  
It is not on my short-term TODO list because there are too many other higher
priority things on my TODO list, but a nice clean well-tested upward-
compatible patch would be most welcome.  
  
PS: for ClearCoin, I used the "bitcoind keeps track of the bitcoins"
architecture, and I never regretted it-- no problems with synchronization,
less possibility for MtGox-like hacks that create mythical bitcoin balances
out of thin air by adding an entry to a database.
