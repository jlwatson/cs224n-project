1) Have you been using bitcoin for more than two months?  
Yes, almost 3 months now.  
  
2) Are you currently attempting to generate coins?  
No (well, not on the production network; I am generating blocks on the TEST
network)  
  
3) If not currently generating, have you attempted in the past? If generating,
how long have you been generating?  
Yes, before the big slashdot interest influx I was generating.  
  
4) Have you ever succeeded in generating a block? Many blocks?  
Probably around 10 blocks while I was generating.  
  
5) Why or why not do you generate?  
I'm a big believer in the power of division of labor and comparative advantage
to make the world a better place. I don't have any particular advantage for
mining bitcoins, and I bet people who _do_ (who have access to lots of cheap
CPU cycles) will be more efficient at mining than me.
