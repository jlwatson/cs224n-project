That's really all I feel comfortable with (well actually not, I was wondering
whether I should update locale files...)  

  
Improving help is definitely helping-- thanks!  
  
And it would be fantastic to get somebody who knows, or is willing to learn,
git to step up and volunteer to submit translation file patches.  
  
I'll soon be asking for building and testing help, too (after fixing another
couple of bugs, I think it'll be time to pull non-controversial patches into
the integration tree and start some serious testing to prepare for another
release).
