Looks like ugly coders for some reason decided to always answer yes to this
question from the console. :^/  

  
I'm not really ugly, am I? You should have seen me in college when I was too
cheap to get a haircut...  
  
So: bitcoind doesn't ask for confirmation before sending fees with a
transaction because it is was much easier to implement that way, and for most
uses of bitcoind paying an occasional transaction fee isn't a problem.  
  
If you'd like to help fix it, patches are welcome. I think a new setting that
says "don't pay more than N bitcoins for any transaction without asking me"
and a new argument to the send routines to say either "I'm willing to pay up
to X bitcoins for this transaction" or "I want to pay X bitcoins in
transaction fees with this transaction" is a good idea.
