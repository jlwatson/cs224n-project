  
Yes, but if two blocks are found with the same difficulty then they are
considered equal work-wise (even if one has a smaller hash value-- the "Bits"
field in the block is used to compute chain work, not the block hash).  
  
If there are several valid tip-of-block-chain choices all of which have the
same work, then miners are free to build off whichever one they like. The rule
everybody (I think!) is using now is "build off the one seen first."
