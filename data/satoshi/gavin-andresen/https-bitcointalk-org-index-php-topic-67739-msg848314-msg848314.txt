Suppose there's a transaction for 100,000BTC and several blocks later a double
spend with 50,000BTC fee...  
  
Maybe there should be a maximum fee per transaction.  

Or maybe you should wait 60 blocks before considering a half-a-million-dollar
transaction final if you think there is any possibility of a mining cabal
trying to do this.  
  
All of this reminds me, I need to clean up my user-defined-checkpoints code
for the 0.7 release, so a cabal of merchants and exchanges can get together
and decide they will "lock in" an agreed-upon blockchain after 6 (or 60 or
whatever) confirmations. I think that would go a long way towards
infrastructure for injecting real-world knowledge about who is trustworthy
into the block-chain.
