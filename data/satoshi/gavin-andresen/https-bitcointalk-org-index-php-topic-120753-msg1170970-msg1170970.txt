When I hear that, I hear "you should stop doing what you're doing for a year
or two or three and re-implement the whole thing."  
  
Yeah... no. As much as that would be a fun project, I don't think that is the
job of the team working on the existing reference implementation. Keeping the
existing software and network running as smoothly as possible is the highest
priority.  
  
Another very high priority is working through issues that arise as alternative
implementations happen (see the current thread in the development section
about non-DER-encoded signatures for a good example). An alternative
implementation that has the kind of accounting that you want is a great idea--
go do it, fund it, or convince somebody else to do it. I think genjix'
libbitcoin has the "store the blockchain in a database" that you want
(although last I heard he was running into performance issues with that
approach).
