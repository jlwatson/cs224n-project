I will be justifying my criticism very shortly.  

  
If you've got a great business model and funding for a much better bitcoin
client, more power to you!  
  
If you're planning on defacing one of the web servers that I haven't been
keeping up-to-date (because I'm busy doing Bitcoin-related things) or hacking
my gmail account to prove that I'm not The World's Best Security Expert...
then I'll save you the trouble:  
  
I am not the World's Best Security Expert.  
I am not the World's Best Programmer.  
I am not a cryptographer.  
I am not an expert on finance or banking or monetary systems.  
I am not an expert on leading open source projects.  
  
And I hope someday I get replaced as the technical lead for this project. I'm
sure there are lots of people better qualified than me, I'm just doing the
best I can to try to help make Bitcoin a success.
