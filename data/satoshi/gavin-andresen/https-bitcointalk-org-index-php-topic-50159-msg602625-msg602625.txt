Another quick update:  
  
Wladimir figured out what was breaking the Win32 cross-compiled builds (one of
the 'hardening' gcc flags is apparently busted for mingw32 cross-compiles), so
Linux and Win32 binaries of a rc2 should be available soon.  
  
Yet another hurdle was thrown in my way by Mother Nature Saturday night; we
got over a foot of snow, and my house and home office still have no power. Mac
builds won't be available until my main machine has power...
