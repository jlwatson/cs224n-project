I just committed (to git and svn) an updated build-msw.txt  
Thanks to m0mchil for putting together a working windows/mingw build
environment.  
  
And I'll be making the 0.3.20 build environment virtual machines (for Windows,
Linux32, and Linux64, in the Amazon EC2 cloud) public, hopefully, if all goes
well, later today.
