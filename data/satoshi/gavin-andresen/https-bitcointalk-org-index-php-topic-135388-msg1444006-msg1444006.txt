Yes, please do a proof-of-concept on testnet.  
  
I suspect this code in CTransaction::GetMinFee() makes the attacks either
slower or more expensive than you estimate because fees increase for
transactions larger than 250Kbytes:  
  

Code:

// Raise the price as the block approaches full  
if (nBlockSize != 1 && nNewBlockSize >= MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_GEN/2)  
{  
if (nNewBlockSize >= MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_GEN)  
return MAX_MONEY;  
nMinFee *= MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_GEN / (MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_GEN - nNewBlockSize);  
}  

  
I don't think these vulnerabilities are serious enough to warrant Official CVE
Numbers, because I think if we create CVE numbers for every expensive-to-
mount, easy-to-recover-from DoS vulnerability we will be denial-of-service-ing
the attention span of users, and they might start ignoring warnings.
