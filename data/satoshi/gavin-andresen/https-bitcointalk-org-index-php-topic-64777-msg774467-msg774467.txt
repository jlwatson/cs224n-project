This would replace the existing JSON-RPC getmemorypool command?  
  

Code:

getmemorypool [data]  
If [data] is not specified, returns data needed to construct a block to work
on:  
"version" : block version  
"previousblockhash" : hash of current highest block  
"transactions" : contents of non-coinbase transactions that should be included
in the next block  
"coinbasevalue" : maximum allowable input to coinbase transaction, including
the generation award and transaction fees  
"coinbaseflags" : data that should be included in coinbase so support for new
features can be judged  
"time" : timestamp appropriate for next block  
"mintime" : minimum timestamp appropriate for next block  
"curtime" : current timestamp  
"bits" : compressed target of next block  
If [data] is specified, tries to solve the block and returns true if it was
successful.  

  
And a meta-question: are there any other implementations that will be
supporting external mining via JSON-RPC soon? There's no reason to go through
the whole BIP process to make a change or improvement to one implementation.
