If I recall correctly, the courts have ruled that "commercial speech" is not
as protected-- so laws that restrict (for example) cigarette ads on television
are OK.  
  
Bitcoin transactions would, I think, be very likely to be classified by the
courts as non-protected speech, if they were classified as 'speech' at all.
