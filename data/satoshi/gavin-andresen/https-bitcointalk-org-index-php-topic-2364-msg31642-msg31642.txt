I've created an 'official' Bitcoin bug/issue/feature request tracking system
at:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues  
  
The github issues system has a simple voting system; lets use it!  
  
And if you see an issue that you want to work on, use the commenting system to
let everybody know you're working on it. I'd like to be open about who is
working on what, and what features/bugs/issues people think are important.  
  
However... we'll still be very conservative about what changes make it into
the official bitcoin client. Bitcoin will be destroyed if people using it lose
their trust in it.
