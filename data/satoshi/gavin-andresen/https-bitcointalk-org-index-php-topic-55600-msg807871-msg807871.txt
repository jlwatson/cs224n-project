I started experimenting with user-defined checkpoints (-checkpoint=height,hash
multiarg, and 'addcheckpoint  ' RPC call) but stopped when higher priority
issues came up.  
  
It seems to me that type of low-level mechanism is the right way to go;
checkpointing is a good low-level way of identifying which chain you think is
"the" chain. And making it command-line/RPC configurable means we don't all
have to agree on One True Way of deciding what the right blockchain aught to
be; cunicula can write some code that implements proof-of-stake and then tie
it into bitcoin/bitcoind using -blocknotify. etotheipi can write some code
that scans the blockchain for well-known miner signatures (or asks miners
directly if they produced a new block), etc.  
  
If your argument is "But Gavin, if core Bitcoin doesn't support One True Way
of doing I'll never be able to convince miners to do it my way!" then I'd say
you need to better express to them how the benefits of your proposal outweigh
the costs.
