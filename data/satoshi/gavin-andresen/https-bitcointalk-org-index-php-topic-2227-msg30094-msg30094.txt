I did a simulation of two cartel strategies along the lines of my previous
post.  
Cartel power Cartel block fraction  
......  
50% 59.86%  

  
There is something wrong with your simulation. Proof:  
  
Imagine a bitcoin world with two Cartels, each with 50% of the power, each
following the strategy you outline.  
  
It is obvious that they cannot BOTH get 59% of the blocks.
