Miner profit in fiat currency = number of transactions * average transaction
fee * btc-to-fiat exchange rate  

Should this not be:  
Miner **revenue** in fiat currency = number of transactions * average
transaction fee * btc-to-fiat exchange rate?  

  
Yes, I meant revenue, not profit.  
  
I need to stop saying "profit" entirely, even when I mean "profit"-- it has
different meanings for economists and ordinary people.
