In other words, are there any versions, or any components of any versions,
that are NOT open source?  

  
It is 100% open source. Bitcoin relies on three other open source projects--
wxWidgets (for the user interface), Boost (for geeky C++ stuff), and OpenSSL
(for cryptographic stuff). Those are all also 100% open source.  
  
Improving The Fine Manual (and the website) will be an ongoing project; thanks
for your questions. I agree that there is a lot of work to be done on the
documentation front. Like most open source projects, most of us developers
find writing code more fun than writing documentation or marketing material.  
  
  
Satoshi is the main developer and person most in control of bitcoin (as said
above). I've been the second-most active developer over the last month or so.  
  
PS: if you have the time and feel like helping out... most of the
documentation is in the Wiki, which anybody can edit. And constructive,
specific suggestions for making the main bitcoin.org web page better are
welcome, too.
