Good point. I assume that miners will choose to mine the version of a
transaction with the highest fee-per-kilobyte, since that will give them the
best profit, but actually changing the code to implement that policy has been
controversial when I've brought it up before.  
  
To fight transaction spam, I think the relaying logic will need to get
smarter, too. A large, expensive-to-verify double-spend should be way down on
the "stuff that should be relayed when there is enough bandwidth" list.  
  
  
That's a different issue, and a new feature. I think the best way to implement
that feature is "child pays for parent" (see
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1647 for a proposed implementation),
and then the user can broadcast a high-fee pay-to-self child transaction to
get the parent accepted into a block.
