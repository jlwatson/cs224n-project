The hosts of Free Talk Live know quite a lot about Bitcoin-- I had lunch with
them last year (there's a thread in here somewhere about that....).  
  
RE: "don't emphasize the potential illegal uses" -- mmmm. Last I heard, Ian
was enthusiastic about the Silk Road, so I'd expect it to be part of the
conversation.  
  
And I think one of the people associated with the show (I'm being vague
because I don't want to reveal something they don't want revealed) lost some
bitcoins when MyBitcoin went away, so I'd expect security/trust issues to be
raised, too.
