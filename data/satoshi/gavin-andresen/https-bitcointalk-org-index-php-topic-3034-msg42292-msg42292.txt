luke-jr's patches got me thinking about whether or not passing double-
precision values over the JSON-RPC api would ever cause problems. I've
convinced myself it isn't an issue:  
  
JSON numbers are 64-bit double-precision floating point values, which have 53
bits of precision.  
  
21 million bitcoins is actually 2,100,000,000,000,000 (2.1 quadrillion) of the
smallest possible unit. That's a bit over 251 \-- you need just over 51 bits
to represent them.  
  
So, unless your JSON library is buggy, you should never run into rounding
errors converting to/from JSON, even if you're sending 0.00000001 bitcoins.
