Two-people-required-to-spend bitcoin addresses would be a great feature for
blockchain.info.  
  
Coins would be sent to that address, then both address owners would have to
agree to spend them (by signing transactions).  
  
The incoming coins **do** have to be fully spent, but it is easy to create
transactions that send the change back into the "vault" (multisig address).
