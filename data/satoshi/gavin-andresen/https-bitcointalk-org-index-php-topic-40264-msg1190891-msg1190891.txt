Now, I could be wrong, and it may be that any coins stored this way must be
fully spent when signed, instead of being able to be spent in parts (vault has
to be emptied entirely, portion is sent to the recepient, remainder goes back
into the vault maybe?)  

Two-people-required-to-spend bitcoin addresses would be a great feature for
blockchain.info.  
  
Coins would be sent to that address, then both address owners would have to
agree to spend them (by signing transactions).  
  
The incoming coins **do** have to be fully spent, but it is easy to create
transactions that send the change back into the "vault" (multisig address).
