For the record:  
  
I've never met Zhou Tong, and wasn't involved in any with with Bitcoinica.  
  
I **have** met Tihan, Charlie and Patrick (Murck), and they are all
responsible grown-ups who, like any of us, occasionally make mistakes. I think
they're making a mistake getting stuck to the Bitcoinica tar-baby, but I think
y'all should give them a little space because I think they're genuinely trying
to help clean up this mess.
