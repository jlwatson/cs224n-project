  
I apologize for coming across as harsh, it has been a hard couple of weeks.  
  
And the reason it has been a hard couple of weeks is because I'm working
really hard to try to get support for multisignature wallets... which would
have prevented your loss (assuming you were using a multisignature-protected
wallet).  
  
The hacker would have been able to ask your bitcoind to send him your coins,
but you would have got a confirmation on your cell phone (or SMS or email with
a one-time-PIN or whatever) and realize immediately that you'd been hacked.  
  
Or, in other words: I've been working really hard trying to get a solution for
the bigger problem of insecure computers, because I really do care about the
"flock."
