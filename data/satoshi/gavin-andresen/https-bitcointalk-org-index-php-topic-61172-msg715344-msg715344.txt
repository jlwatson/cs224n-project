So, yes, i did 4 out of 4. I had no idea mistakes were prune to ratings.  
So if I or anyone does 5 mistakes, what then, you think our house should blow
up?  
  
....  
  
It's just a disappointment to see development does not care about its 'flock'
- we, who make mistakes as any human does, are on our own.  
Fair enough, from your pedestal point of view, of course.  

  
I apologize for coming across as harsh, it has been a hard couple of weeks.  
  
And the reason it has been a hard couple of weeks is because I'm working
really hard to try to get support for multisignature wallets... which would
have prevented your loss (assuming you were using a multisignature-protected
wallet).  
  
The hacker would have been able to ask your bitcoind to send him your coins,
but you would have got a confirmation on your cell phone (or SMS or email with
a one-time-PIN or whatever) and realize immediately that you'd been hacked.  
  
Or, in other words: I've been working really hard trying to get a solution for
the bigger problem of insecure computers, because I really do care about the
"flock."
