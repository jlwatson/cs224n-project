It's a bad idea to try to break the "in-production" bitcoin network.  
  
If anybody is starting serious work on either extending Bitcoin or developing
compatible implementations or trying to break it by creating bad transactions,
I think creating a "parallel universe" test network with its own block chain,
data directory, etc makes sense.  
  
Satoshi: would you be open to a --testnetwork (or something) flag to bitcoin
that swapped to an alternate genesis block, data directory, listen port and
IRC channel? Maybe with a really short average block generation time, too
(like once per minute instead of once per 10 minutes) so everything happens
ten times a fast to make testing quicker.
