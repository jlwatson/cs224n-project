It doesn't 'feel right' to me.  
  
Seems like the ideal API would be:  
  
"Hey bitcoin, I want to keep track of all transactions for account FOO (or all
accounts) that have [minconf] confirmations. Please POST them to [url]."  
  
or  
  
"Hey bitcoin, I want to keep track of all transactions for account FOO (or all
accounts) that have [minconf] confirmations. I'll be polling you to see if
there are any new ones every once in a while, I'll pass you [unique_token] so
you know it is me."  
  
... at least for the simple case. You'd get back two lists of transactions:
new transactions with [minconf] that you haven't been told about before (maybe
empty in the polling case), and a list of transactions you were told about
before that now have less than [minconf] confirmations because of a block
chain re-org (always empty if [minconf] is big enough).  
  
  
  
For the "I really want to shoot myself in the foot and deal with block-chain
reorgs myself" you can call getblock and/or monitorblock to get all the gory
details about which transactions are in which blocks.
