So... have clients send back their best N hashes (and the average should be N
times better).  
  
RE: detecting server cheating: Over a very long period of time, clients should
be able to figure out approximately how many hash/sec the server's network is
generating. So they should be able to detect blatant cheating. I should've
taken statistics in college, seems like it'd be an interesting problem to work
out the chances that a server is lying based on how many blocks it has
generated over the last week...
