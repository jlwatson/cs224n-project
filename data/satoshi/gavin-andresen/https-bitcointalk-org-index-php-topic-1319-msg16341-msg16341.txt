Keeping the patch file up-to-date is another couple of steps, and I
could/should automate it.  

I automated updating/patching the monitorreceived patch, and just updated to
Satoshi's latest:  
http://gist.github.com/604574  
(use the "raw" link there for a link to latest version of the patch)  
  
And I fixed the bug reported by doublec.
