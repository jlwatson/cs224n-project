  
Check your math-- to get 51% you'll need to dedicate six times as much
hardware to hashing as it takes to get 15%:  
  
The formula for what fraction of existing hashing power you need add to get X%
of the network is:  

Code:

H = X / (1-X)

  
To get 15%, you need to add 17.6%. E.g. if existing hashing power is 100, then
you add 17.6 more and your fraction is (17.6/117.6) = 0.15.  
  
To get 51%, you need to add 104%. E.g. if existing hashing power is 100, then
you add 104, then your fraction is (104/204) = 0.51.  
  
104 is six times as much as 17.6.
