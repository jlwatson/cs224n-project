Hello fellows!  
I'm actually running bitcoind server to receive and send transaction through
my own software.  
Transaction size of my spends are always near to 100kb/500kb, so how do I set
a minimum/pseudo-fixed transaction fee in my bitcoin.conf/software? If you
haven't figured out yet what I mean, I would always pay 0.0001 BTC for each
spend cause they never exceed 1.000kb.  
Hoping in a fast reply  

  
You can't, the reference implementation wallet always pays some-amount-
per-1000-bytes-of-the-transaction.  
  
The rules for the 0.10 release are:  
  
\+ By default, you always pay a fee (this is different from previous releases
that would send transactions without a fee if they had high enough priority)
(run with -sendfreetransactions=1 to get the old behavior of sending high-
priority transactions without a fee)  
\+ By default, the fee-per-kilobyte is estimated based on recent transaction
confirmation history.  
  
To get close to what you want (pay a fixed fee per transaction), run with
-paytxfee=0.whatever : that tells the wallet code to pay 0.whatever BTC per
1000 bytes. Most transactions are about 500 bytes big.  
  
See here: http://core2.bitcoincore.org/smartfee/fee_graph.html ... for how
high to make -paytxfee=0.whatever based on how long you're willing to wait for
the first confirmation (that page graphs estimates from the latest&greatest
fee estimation code from Alex Morcos that will hopefully be in the 0.11
Bitcoin Core release).
