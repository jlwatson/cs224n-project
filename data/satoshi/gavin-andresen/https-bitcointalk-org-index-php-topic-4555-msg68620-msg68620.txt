In jgarzik's original implementation, an attacker can pre-generate a rainbow
table with 2^32 entries, and that lets them take a shortcut so they only have
to try 2^32 bits for any particular scratch card (algorithm is, essentially,
"foreach value in 2^32: do some complicated math, then see if the result
matches a value in the 2^32-size rainbow table; if it does, you've found the
unknown 2^64 bits").
