Yeah, I shoulda anticipated problems when Bitcoins went from 0.005 USD each to
0.06 each. If it takes somebody two minutes to go through the "get a new IP,
get a new BC address, solve the captcha" process then they'd make 5*30=150
bitcoins an hour, which is $9 USD an hour, which, if you're unemployed, bored,
and/or 13 years old is easy money.
