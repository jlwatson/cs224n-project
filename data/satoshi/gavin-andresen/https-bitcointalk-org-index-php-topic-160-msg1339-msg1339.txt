One Amazon "EC2 compute unit" is, according to them, approximately equal to a
1ghz 2007 Xeon processor (that's a m1.small).  
  
Judging by my laptop generating experience, there's no way an m1.small
instance would generate enough à¸¿ to be profitable.  
  
The heftiest instance you can buy ("large CPU") is 20 units big, and costs
$0.231 per hour; with bitcoins selling for about a half a penny each it would
have to generate 46 per hour (or about a block an hour) to break even.
Ummm.... no, that does not compute.

version I compiled from source code.
