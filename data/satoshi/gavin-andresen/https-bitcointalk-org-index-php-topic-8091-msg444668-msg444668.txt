What is the status/eta of this pull request? Unless integration is eminent
we'd be willing to offer a bounty to help accelerate it's release. We really
need this feature, our current workaround involving multiple bitcoind
instances, and relaunch rescan per user session is catastrophically
cumbersome.  

  
It will get pulled/released faster if you help test it. Pull the patch,
compile a custom bitcoind, then run it and report any bugs. If you don't find
any bugs, add a short note either here or in the PULL request.  
  
Testing is currently the bottleneck for getting new features...
