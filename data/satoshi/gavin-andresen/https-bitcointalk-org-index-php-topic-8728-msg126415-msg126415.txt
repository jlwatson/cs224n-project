Random thought RE: passwords and RPC:  
  
I was thinking a better way of handling the password might be a new RPC
command:  
  
walletpassword <password> <timeout>  
  
... which would store <password> in memory for <timeout> seconds. If you know
your server is secure, you'd give a very long <timeout> at startup.  
  
That same <timeout> mechanism might be very handy in the GUI (somebody who
knows more about password security might have something intelligent to say
about the tradeoff between the risk of storing hashed-password in memory
versus the convenience of not having to constantly re-enter it).  
  
A walletpasswordchange <oldpassword> <newpassword> seems like it would be very
handy, too.  
  
Tacking <password> onto the beginning of RPC argument lists seems like the
wrong thing to do.
