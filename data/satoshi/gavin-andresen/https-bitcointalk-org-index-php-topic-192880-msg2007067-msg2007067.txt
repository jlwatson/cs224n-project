our devs have implemented the protocol per the docs at
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification . additionally, they have
been reading bitcoind code as necessary to make everything work. there are a
couple scenarios where bitcoind does not behave according to the published
spec. we are currently quirking around this but we can document it if you
think it helpful.  

  
Yes, please, feedback from re-implementors is very helpful.
