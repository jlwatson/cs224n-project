To get back to the original question, paying to a bitcoin addresses displayed
on an https: webpage secured with a valid certificate is better.  
  
When the bitcoin client supports secure connections to IP addresses, then
paying to an IP address displayed on an https: webpage secured with a valid
certificate will be just as good (security-wise, anyway).  
  
Bitcoin doesn't try to solve the "am I paying who I THINK I'm paying problem"
-- we need HTTPS and signed certificates and DNSSEC for that (or something
similar). Bitcoins are a small but really important piece of the payment
puzzle...
