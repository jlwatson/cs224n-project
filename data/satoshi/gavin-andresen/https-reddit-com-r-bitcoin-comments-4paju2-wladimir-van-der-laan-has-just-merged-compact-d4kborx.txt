RE: jtoomim's tests:

I started with the assumption that EITHER miners are not idiots, and won't create blocks that orphan themselves because they take a long time to validate/propagate (if they are idiots, they'll go out of business).

OR that if there is an advantage to making blocks take a long time to propagate, that same advantage can be had by simply selfish mining (unless you make absurd assumptions that miners can control the network topology of other miners).

Block size limit != block size miners choose, and bitcoind can handle much, much larger blocks.

As for the email thread:  it is the one that started with "I think we're hurting bitcoin because the lack of a scaling plan is causing a huge amount of uncertainty" and ended with me asking for help with simulation/testing/etc (zero response, I guess you were too busy with BlockStream stuff). 

BUT: all that's in the past. What's the current plan for the hard fork that's on Core's road map?
