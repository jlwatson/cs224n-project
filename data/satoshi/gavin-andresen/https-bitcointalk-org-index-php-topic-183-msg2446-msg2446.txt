Gavin, you COULD look at the previous owner of the coins and remove that
address from your blacklist. However, I dunno about the IP data.  

Yeah, I could, but it seemed like more trouble than it was worth; if you got
coins from the Faucet into a non-empty wallet and then donated them back
there's no guarantee that the donation back would be the SAME coins. I just
don't want to deal with a lot of "I got five coins and then sent back ten but
I still can't get more from the Faucet...."
