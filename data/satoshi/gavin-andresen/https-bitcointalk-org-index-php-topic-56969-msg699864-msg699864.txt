I think you're correct (I think it's just that changes like this make people
nervous). What then is the next step to enable multi-sig? Is everything needed
already in the scripting language? Is it just a matter of updating clients and
miners to no longer reject such transactions?  

  
Yes, the next step is to get miners and clients to recognize a new 'standard'
transaction type that does multisig. BIP 11 describes them, they're already
supported in git HEAD and by the p2sh code, and old miners and clients will
recognize and validate blocks that contain OP_CHECKMULTISIG transactions.
