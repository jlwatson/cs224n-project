To steal your bitcoins by breaking crypto (as opposed to getting your private
key), somebody would have to:  
  
1\. Break RIPEMD160. Because your bitcoin address is a RIPEMD160 hash... AND  
2\. Break SHA256. Because your bitcoin address is a RIPEMD160 hash of the
SHA256 hash... AND  
3\. Break the ECDSA elliptic curve ~~encryption~~ signature algorithm, to
figure out the private key that corresponds to the public key that they got
from breaking (1) and (2).  
  
That's assuming that you don't re-use bitcoin receiving addresses (your public
key is revealed the first time you spend coins that were sent to that
address). If you do re-use the same receiving address, then they just need
(3).  
  
I don't spend any time worrying about whether or not the NSA (or anybody else)
can break ECDSA.
