RE: particular ideas if "we" decide the blocksize has to be increased:  
  
I think the first step is to come to rough consensus that, at some point, we
WILL need a hardfork to increase the block size limit.  
  
If we can come to rough consensus on that, then we can figure out the safest
way to accomplish that.  
  
I don't think we'll get consensus; retep and others will argue "we need to run
into the hard limit to FORCE alternatives to be created first."  
  
I keep saying we should see what happens as we run into the soft blocksize
limits. To people on both sides of this debate: what do you predict will
happen?  
  
If what you predict will happen doesn't actually happen, will that make you
re-evaluate your position?  
  
(I haven't spent enough time thinking about this problem to answer those
questions, but that is how I'm going to think about it).
