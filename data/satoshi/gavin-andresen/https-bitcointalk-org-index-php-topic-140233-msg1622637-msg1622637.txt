If Mr. Augustus found some documentation that I don't know about it, I
genuinely want to know about it, because it will save me time. Right now I'm
throwing blocks at an instrumented v0.7.2 bitcoind that tells me how many
locks are taken, so I can be sure whatever fix we implement will always work.
