The same thing that happens with other projects run by engineers-- they worry way too much about some obscure, unlikely-to-happen technical problem that matches their interests and ignore problems their customers are having RIGHT NOW.

You see it with engineers at startups who spend three years building infrastructure that can handle Facebook-level volume ('better be ready just in case')... and then they never ship and their money runs out.
