First: the bitcoin.org homepage links will be updated as soon as sirius has a
chance to wake up, read his email, and make the changes.  
  
  
A different skin for the Windows build is from upgrading the wxWidgets used to
build (2.9.1 instead of 2.9.0).  
  
Did anybody test the -nolisten with the GUI bitcoin on Windows?  
I believe there is windows-specific code for checking to see if another
bitcoin is running that looks at window titles; file an issue at github if
-nolisten isn't doing what you expect.
