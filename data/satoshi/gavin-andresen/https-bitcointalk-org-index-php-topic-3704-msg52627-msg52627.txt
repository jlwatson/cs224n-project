First: the bitcoin.org homepage links will be updated as soon as sirius has a
chance to wake up, read his email, and make the changes.

Thank you for new release! I have two little questions:  
  
\- Windows build use little different skin than previous version. Is this a
mistake or intention? Nothing which I really care about, I just noticed.  
\- Is there a reason why "bitcoin.exe -datadir=c:\bitcoin2 -nolisten" don't
start second client instance?  

  
A different skin for the Windows build is from upgrading the wxWidgets used to
build (2.9.1 instead of 2.9.0).  
  
Did anybody test the -nolisten with the GUI bitcoin on Windows?  
I believe there is windows-specific code for checking to see if another
bitcoin is running that looks at window titles; file an issue at github if
-nolisten isn't doing what you expect.
