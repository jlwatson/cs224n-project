I have Bitcoin (GUI version) running (and mining) on two machines, but can
obviously only forward port 8333 to one of those.  
What implications does this have for the machine without incoming connections?  

  
It will have only 8 (outgoing) connections.  
  
With fewer connections, it will notice new blocks a tiny bit more slowly than
the other machine, and blocks it finds will propagate to the rest of the
network slightly more slowly than the other machine. So it will spend a teeny-
tiny bit more time working on an out-of-date block chain, and will be a teeny-
tiny bit more likely to lose "announce a new block" races. But I bet the
effects are so small you'd never notice them.

Will it be able to "find" coins while mining?  
Will it be able to receive coins by transactions (more precisely: will
received coins be displayed without my intervention)?  
Will the answers be any different for "bitcoind"?  

  
Yes and yes and no.
