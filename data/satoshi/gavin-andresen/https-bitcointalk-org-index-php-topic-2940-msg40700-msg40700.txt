  
It will have only 8 (outgoing) connections.  
  
With fewer connections, it will notice new blocks a tiny bit more slowly than
the other machine, and blocks it finds will propagate to the rest of the
network slightly more slowly than the other machine. So it will spend a teeny-
tiny bit more time working on an out-of-date block chain, and will be a teeny-
tiny bit more likely to lose "announce a new block" races. But I bet the
effects are so small you'd never notice them.  
  
  
Yes and yes and no.
