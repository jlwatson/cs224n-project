We can calculate the minimum unit from following algorithm:  
  

Code:

# [Total value] = all Dollars in circulation + Euros in circulation + Yens in
circulation + CNY in circulation + all the other currencies  
# Convert [Total value] to amount of smallest units/fractions of the earth's
cheapest currency (*excluding* internet currencies and currencies of countries
with hyperinflation)  
# Add one or 2 zeros.  

There you have it. The humanity will probably never require more units of
Bitcoin than that, even if Bitcoin becomes #1 World currency and everybody on
the world starts using Bitcoin instead of other currencies.  
  
Currently, total amount of the smallest units of Bitcoin is
2,100,000,000,000,000 which is just over 2 thousands of trillions (USA scale).
Is it enough according to the equation above ? I highly doubt so.  

  
Let me google that for you.... ah, here's a nice chart:

There is about 5 trillion dollars in currency in the world.  
  
So 2.1 thousand trillion satoshis is **PLENTY**.
