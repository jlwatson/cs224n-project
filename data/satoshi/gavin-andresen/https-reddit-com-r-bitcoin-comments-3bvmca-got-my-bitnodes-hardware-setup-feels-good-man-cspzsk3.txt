Let's see...  8GB every 10 minutes is:

...13Mbps. It's got gigabit ethernet (1,000Mbps) so that should work just fine.

...about 30,000 transactions per second. I'd have to benchmark the Quad-Core ARM, and I don't know how fast the Quad-Core GPU would be at signature verification (somebody would need to write GPU signature verification code). My guess is together they could validate a few thousand transactions per second.

You'll definitely need a faster CPU (or one with more cores) to fully validate 8GB blocks.

You'll also need more fast-ish memory for storing the unspent transaction outputs set-- 64GB almost certainly won't be enough. But in 20 years we'll be measuring memory chip capacity in terabytes.

 And, of course, if you want to store the entire block chain you'd need to hook up a hard drive (you could run pruned, of course, with a few hundred GB of storage).
