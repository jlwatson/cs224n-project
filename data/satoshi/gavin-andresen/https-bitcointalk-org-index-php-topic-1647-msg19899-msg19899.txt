  
If Satoshi goes rogue, then the project forks. He has a very strong incentive
(success of the project, growth of the value of the bitcoins he owns) not to
do that.  
  
If the SVN repo gets hacked, then we back out the hacked changes (that's easy
to see; several of us look at every svn commit) and warn people who might have
compiled with bad source to recompile.  
  
I'm having trouble figuring out exactly what you would like to happen-- is
your complaint that you have a different definition of what "open source,
peer-to-peer" means than the rest of us?
