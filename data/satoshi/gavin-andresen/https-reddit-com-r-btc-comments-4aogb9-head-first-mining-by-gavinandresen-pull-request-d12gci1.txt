Nope.  It is actually faster.  Current protocol:

*   A send 'header' to B
*   B replies with 'getdata' to A
*   A sends 'block' to B
*   B validate, and then send 'header' to C
*   C replies with 'getdata' to B
*   B sends 'block' to C

With head-first:

*    A sends 'header' to B
*    B replies with 'getdata' to A
*    B sends 'header' to C
*    C replies with 'getdata' to B
*    A sends 'block' to B
*    B validates then sends 'block' to C

The getdata/block requests are overlapped, so block data propagates a little faster.
