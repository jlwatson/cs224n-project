  
What percentage support by February 15'th would make you comfortable? As I
said, if it is 55% from Feb 1 to Feb 15'th (or, worse, if it varies a lot in
that time) then I think we'll need to re-assess. I expect to get well over 70%
support starting Feb 1.  
  
I'd rather use some common sense rather than spend days arguing about exactly
what percentage aught to be specified in the BIP, or how many standard
deviations of variance are acceptable between Feb 1 and 15.
