Yeah, that would be a good problem to have.  
  
Why would they mess around with the block chain, though? Are you imagining the
men in black double-spending enough Bitcoins to make merchants think it is
untrustworthy? ("I shipped 100 computers to Langley, Virginia when the
transaction had six confirmations, and now there's a new block chain that says
those coins were paid to somebody else!!!")
