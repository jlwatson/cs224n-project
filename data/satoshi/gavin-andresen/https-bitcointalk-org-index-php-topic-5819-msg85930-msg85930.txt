RE: paying somebody to monitor the faucet: good idea, although I like the idea
of some kind of "community watch" more. And monitoring the Faucet is an all-
day-and-night, all-the-time kind of job. And if the scammers are willing to
try to drain the faucet slowly then they could create accounts with more
realistic-looking names and would be able to sneak by the monitors...  
  
RE: just using testnet coins: I worry about people starting to trade testnet
coins, giving them real value. Giving lots of newbies who don't really
understand bitcoin testnet coins seems like a really good way to make that
happen!  
  
RE: proof-of-work before getting coins: Interesting idea! Some JavaScript in-
the-browser proof-of-work that required keeping the 'get some' page open for a
minute or six might make the cost to the scammers high enough that the bitcoin
reward wouldn't be worth it.  
  
RE: looking at the google account creation date: that information isn't
available to the Faucet's code (unless I'm missing something in the Google App
Engine API).
