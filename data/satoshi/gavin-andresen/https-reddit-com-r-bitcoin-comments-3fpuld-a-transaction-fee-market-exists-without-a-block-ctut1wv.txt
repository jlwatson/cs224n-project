The conclusion is that poorly-connected miners suffer at the expense of well-connected miners? What happens if 'F' is directly connected to 'A'?  Are you assuming that 'A' can somehow control network topology?

It is interesting that it is 'B' and 'C' in your simulation (the big-block-miner's peers) who profit the most. If your simulation is correct, it seems like it is a disincentive for 'A' to try this attack.

And when you say 'A' stops doing work after relaying a big block... that's odd. Does the simulation change if it keeps doing work while its huge block is propagating?
