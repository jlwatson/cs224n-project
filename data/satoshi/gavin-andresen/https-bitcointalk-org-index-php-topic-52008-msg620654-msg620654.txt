I have upgraded to RC5 0.5 XP SP 3. I have encrypted the wallet. How do I know
if it worked for sure?  

  
To be absolutely sure, you need to extract your private keys and then run a
tool to look for them in your wallet.dat file (or other files on your disk).  
  
If you are able to compile a custom version of bitcoin and run python, here's
how:

If you can't compile a custom version of bitcoin or run python code, then
you'll have to trust other people to thoroughly test.
