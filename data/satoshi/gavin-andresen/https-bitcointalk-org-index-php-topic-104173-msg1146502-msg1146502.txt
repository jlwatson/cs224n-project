Solo miners, miners using p2pol, and mining pool operators will eventually
have to upgrade.  
  
RE: "Is there any web service to see the current ratio of v1 / v2?"  
  
I bet if you ask nicely blockchain.info will create a page. I expect it to
take a long time (a year or more) before 95% of the hashing power has upgraded
and is producing v2 blocks.  
  
The getblock RPC call will tell you a block's version number; if you're an old
bash user like me then you can do something like:  

Code:

last=$(./bitcoind getblockcount);  
for (( i=last-100; i <= last; i=i+1 )); do echo -n $i; ./bitcoind getblock
$(./bitcoind getblockhash $i) | grep version; done

... to see the version numbers of the last 100 blocks (I see 2 of 100 right
now).
