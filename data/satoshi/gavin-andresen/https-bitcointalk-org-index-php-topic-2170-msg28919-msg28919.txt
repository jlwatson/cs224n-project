Sorry to send you on a wild goose chase, the problem is **NOT** CRLF issues.  
  
The problem is in your HTTP headers; you're sending the request as:  
  
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  
  
The correct Content-Type for JSON-RPC over HTTP is:  
Content-Type SHOULD be 'application/json-rpc' but MAY be 'application/json' or
'application/jsonrequest'  
  
I'm not sure what .net is doing with the body of the request, but by the time
it gets to Bitcoin/PostBin, it has x-www-form-urlencoded it enough to confuse
the heck out of them.  
  
When you get this working, please update this thread, and for extra positive
karma, add a .net section to the Bitcoin JSON-RPC wiki page.
