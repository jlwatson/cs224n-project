Can we not beat this dead horse?  
  
I think there are MUCH more important things to work on / worry about than
whether or not "send 1 BTC" is expressed as "sendtoaddress FOO 1.00" or
"sendtoaddress FOO 100000000" in the JSON-RPC.  
  
How about we (I'll start) write a "Proper Money Handling" page for the Wiki
that discusses the issue and gives code example of how to convert to/from JSON
double-precision floating point and 64-bit integer?
