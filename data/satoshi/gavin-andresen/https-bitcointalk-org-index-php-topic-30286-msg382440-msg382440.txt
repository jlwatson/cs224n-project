The google link on the bitcoin.org homepage is/was my idea.  
  
"The One True Forums" for bitcoin doesn't make sense to me-- the whole point
of bitcoin is to be decentralized. I sincerely believe that open and free
competition makes everything better, and I hope that more places to discuss
bitcoin pop up and compete to be the best.  
  
In the future, I'd like most of the links on the bitcoin.org home page to be
google searches, including the "download bitcoin" links (I think we'll see
some great new bitcoin clients released over the next six months or so).
