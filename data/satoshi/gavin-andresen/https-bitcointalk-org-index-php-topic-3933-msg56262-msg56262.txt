  
JollyGreen was asking about 'typical people'. And I think he was asking about
"right now".  
  
Typical people aren't going to distinguish the currency from all of the
financial services that make the currency safe, convenient, etc. And I think
we should be honest-- bitcoin-the-currency needs more mature financial
services before bitcoin-the-system makes sense as a payment solution for
typical people.
