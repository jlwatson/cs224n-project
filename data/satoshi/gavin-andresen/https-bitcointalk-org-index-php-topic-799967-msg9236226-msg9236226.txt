I really don't have experience with those offline wallets but if somehow my PC
get burned or something & I can't fix .. does it mean I will lose all my
bitcoins unless I took a backup ? if yes how to take a backup  

If you're using the GUI: File->Backup Wallet...  
  
If you're using bitcoind: use the backupwallet RPC command.
