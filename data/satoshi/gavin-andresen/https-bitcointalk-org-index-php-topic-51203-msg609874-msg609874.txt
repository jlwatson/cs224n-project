I purchased this laptop:  
http://www.ebay.com/itm/290608305269  
  
... to do Bitcoin 'gitian' builds. It's a perfectly good laptop, runs nicely,
but I'm re-selling it because its Core Duo CPU can't do 64-bit builds.  
  
Specs are:  
1.83 Mhz Core Duo processor  
120GB memory  
2G disk  
Wifi  
  
Running Ubuntu 11.04, includes laptop, battery and power supply.  
  
Asking 50 BTC, I'll pay shipping anywhere in the US; if I don't get any takers
here, I'll re-auction it on Ebay on Friday, Nov 11.
