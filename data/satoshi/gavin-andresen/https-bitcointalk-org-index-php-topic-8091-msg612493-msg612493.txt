No issues with export wallets/private keys. I share gmaxwell's concerns about
making it easy to shoot yourself in the foot, but most of us are grown-ups and
if you're talking using the RPC interface there are already plenty of ways to
shoot your feet.  
  
Remove private key I had issues with, because if you're using the 'accounts'
feature then removing keypairs from a wallet (and their associated
transactions) does unpredictable things to account balances. At the very
least, I think it should tell you what effects it had. Maybe a JSON result
that tells you how account balances changed, e.g. { "" : 1, "John's Wallet" :
6.2, etc.}. That way, if it had an unexpected effects you would know to
restore the wallet from backup.  
  
And it seems like 'sweep private key' and 'merge wallets' is really the
functionality most people want, not import private key/wallet keys. The only
issue I have with them is they are slow because of the rescanning of the block
chain, and they may not work or may not be secure if you don't happen to have
the whole block chain downloaded.
