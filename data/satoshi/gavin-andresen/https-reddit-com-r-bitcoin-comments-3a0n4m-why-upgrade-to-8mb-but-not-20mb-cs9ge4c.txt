It is symmetric, so if 60% of mining is in China, and blocks propagate fast inside China, then THEY have a small advantage.

Unless one of them connects to the fast relay network, which is about 100 times more efficient.

Or most of them put block announcing nodes on both sides of the firewall, pre-send the blocks they are working on through the firewall, and just send the winning nonce and coinbase when they find a block.
