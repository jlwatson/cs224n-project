  
The code is written and committed to the master branch, backports are
available for every bitcoin release since 0.3.19, and I'm as confident as I
can be there are no major bugs or "gotchas" hiding in the pay-to-script-hash
code. Several of the big mining pools have been testing it and will start
deploying it on the main network.  
  
"This stuff" IS programmed in a way so it is only activated on the main
network after an agreed-upon time.  
  
There are still two weeks until we look and see how much support it has, and
almost a month before /P2SH/ transactions are fully validated on the main
network. You want to wait 30,000 more blocks? More than 7 months? That's a
darn good way to get everybody to ignore the issue for 6 months and then
restart this debate from square one with 1 month to go and a whole fresh set
of people who think they're being helpful suggesting using OP_ADD to combine
private keys because they don't realize we thought about and discarded that
idea 4 months ago.
