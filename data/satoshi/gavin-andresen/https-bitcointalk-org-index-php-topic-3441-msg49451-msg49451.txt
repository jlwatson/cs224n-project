One more thought: the "finney attack" can only be profitable if the reward
from cheating is greater than (reward of mining times the probability your
block will be rejected because you delay announcing it while you "run down to
the store").  
  
Reward for block is currently $50, that will (hopefully!) continue to rise for
the next decade or two.  
  
Say it takes you 5 minutes to complete a transaction at the corner store (half
the average block gen time)... today you'd have to make a $25-or-greater
purchase just to break even.  
  
Seems likely this attack will be completely impractical for transactions under
$200 when the block reward is worth more than $400. 0-confirmations (just wait
N seconds to look for a quick double-spend) for any transaction under $200
seems "good enough" to me.
