Thaddeus Dryja's "proof of idle" idea hasn't been getting enough attention.
See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN2TPeQ9mnA  
  
The idea is to get paid NOT to mine, because it is economically rational for
everybody to keep the difficulty lower rather than higher (everybody saves
money on electricity if everybody can somehow agree to keep their equipment
idle). Thaddeus figured out a way of solving the coordination problem so
nobody can lie about how much mining power they have or profit from cheating
and running miners that they promised to keep idle.  
  
Having lots of idle mining capacity is appealing for at least two reasons --
it is more energy efficient, and if an attack of some kind is detected it
could be brought online instead of kept idle to help fight the attack.

However... I suspect that taking that idle mining power, pointing it to a big
mining pool, and then performing a winning-share-withholding-attack (if you
find a share that satisfies full network difficulty, don't submit it to the
pool -- just throw it away and pretend it never happened) could be a way of
doubling your profits, because you drive down difficulty, get paid for "idle"
capacity, AND get a share of the profits from the mining pool you're
attacking.
