I dont understand this: How do we know if the block is coming from a
misbehaving client (eg which sends "orphan" blocks on purpose), or a block
that comes from a slow miner, so the block cannot go into the blockchain
because that node was too slow and another node was first, and thus that block
becomes orphan?  

  
The misbehaving client creates orphan blocks with very low proof-of-work; the
unlucky miner creates orphan blocks with valid proof-of-work.  
  
The misbehaving client gets away with their misbehavior by either anchoring
their bogus blocks deep in the chain, when blocks had very easy proof-of-work.  
  
Or giving them a bogus "previous block hash" so they're not anchored anywhere
in the chain at all.
