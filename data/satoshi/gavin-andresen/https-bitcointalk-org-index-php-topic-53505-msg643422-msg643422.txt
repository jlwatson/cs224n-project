  
The misbehaving client creates orphan blocks with very low proof-of-work; the
unlucky miner creates orphan blocks with valid proof-of-work.  
  
The misbehaving client gets away with their misbehavior by either anchoring
their bogus blocks deep in the chain, when blocks had very easy proof-of-work.  
  
Or giving them a bogus "previous block hash" so they're not anchored anywhere
in the chain at all.
