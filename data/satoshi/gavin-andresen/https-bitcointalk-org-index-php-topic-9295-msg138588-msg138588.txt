If processing old transactions becomes expensive, then miners will start
charging transaction fees to include them in their blocks.  
  
Speculating about exactly HOW the miners will charge (will they subscribe to
an 'old transaction service' or somehow contact the old-transaction-spender
for the merkle branch of the old transaction?) is a waste of time, in my
humble opinion.
