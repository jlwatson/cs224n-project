Focusing on the use cases is the right approach.

4\. Export selected keys for transferring their funds to someone else; the
recipient imports the keys and gains access to the funds.  
Any others?  

  
One variation:  
  
5\. Export keys to transfer funds to somebody else. Recipient is expected to
import and then immediately send-to-self. Sender keeps the keys 'set aside' in
the wallet until they are spent by recipient, or, if not spent by recipient
(lost in transit maybe, or recipient chokes on a lollipop before having a
chance to redeem), may be added back into the sender's balance.  
  
And one usability comment:  
  
Is "selected keys" the right way to go? Just selecting an amount of bitcoins
to export/send seems like a better way to go (with a send-to-self transaction
generated, if necessary, to create the right amount), with maybe an "advanced"
option later that lets you select specific inputs to export/send.
