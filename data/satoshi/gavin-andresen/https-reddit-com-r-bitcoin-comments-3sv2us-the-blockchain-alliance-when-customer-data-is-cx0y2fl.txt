So...

Imagine we live in Voluntopia. There are no governments, everybody is free to interact, to put whatever they like into their bodies, etc.

There would still be law enforcement, of course, it would just be private law enforcement instead of government law enforcement.

If we lived in such a world, would it be OK to talk with law enforcement about how criminals use Bitcoin or the block chain to defraud or extort people?

I'm pragmatic; I want to see Bitcoin succeed, and I want to help law enforcement catch people who are harming other people. Yes, I know government law enforcement does a lot of OTHER things that have nothing to do with bad people hurting good people; I hope that changes one day.

Reasonable people can disagree about whether it is better long-term strategy to engage with people you disagree with or disengage. Maybe if I'd studied history or politics instead of computer science I'd believe disengagement was the best strategy; maybe somebody who HAS studied history or politics can chime in....
