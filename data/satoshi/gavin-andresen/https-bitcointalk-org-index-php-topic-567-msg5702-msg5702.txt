Well, at least do it on the TEST network FIRST!  
  
If you manage to break the TEST network, it's a pretty good bet that you'll be
able to break the production network. If it doesn't break the TEST network,
then I'd say go ahead and run against the production network to look for
"scaling up" problems.
