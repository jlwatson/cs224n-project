Imagine that you discover a fork condition between V1 and V2 of bitcoin core.  
Surely enough, this should be reported to github, and test data must be
updated.  

  
No, please report security-critical issues (including consensus bugs) to the
bitcoin-security mailing list: bitcoin-security@lists.sourceforge.net
