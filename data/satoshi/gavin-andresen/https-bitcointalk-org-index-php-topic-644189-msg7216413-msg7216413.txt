New 'estimatefee' and 'estimatepriority' RPC commands were just pulled into
Bitcoin Core.  
  
And I threw up a web page that updates estimates with every new block found:
http://bitcoincore.org/smartfee/  
  
Assuming I got the crontab correct, daily fee/priority estimates will be
archived there starting tomorrow.
