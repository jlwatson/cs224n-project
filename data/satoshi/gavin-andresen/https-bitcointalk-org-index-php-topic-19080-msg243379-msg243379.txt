FYI: I posted this here on the forums because I see the mailing list as being
for nuts-and-bolts "lets talk about exactly how to get XYZ done."  
  
And I see these forums as a better place for brainstorming and pie-in-the-sky
maybe-it-will-work-maybe-it-won't discussions.  
  
Also, equations don't look pretty in plain-text emails.
