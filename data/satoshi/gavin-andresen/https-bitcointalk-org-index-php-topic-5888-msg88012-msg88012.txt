It always bothered me that the MySQL's SELECT... LIMIT statement could skip
records if the database was changing between calls, but that doesn't seem to
bother anybody else.  
  
This patch is very much like MySQL LIMIT, is needed for the same reason
(paging through results efficiently in a GUI), is backwards compatible, and
looks good to me.
