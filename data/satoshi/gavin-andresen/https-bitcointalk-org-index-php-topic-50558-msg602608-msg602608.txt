"Following a 1,000,000% Gain" as a headline is still a fault. I suppose if you
can document that someone bought 3000 Bitcoins for $.10 early and then someone
sold 3000 bitcoins for $100,000 at a peak that could be a fair statement...  

  
One million percent is a 10,000 times rise in price.  
The first trades on bitcoinmarket.com were at a price of something like 0.001
US dollars; 10,000 times that would be $10, and lots of bitcoins traded over
$10 earlier this year.  
  
So I think the Fool got it right.
