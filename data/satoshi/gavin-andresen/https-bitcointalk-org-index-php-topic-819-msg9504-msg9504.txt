Also, there could be a lot of cpu power on Mars as well. So, the New York
vending machine shouldn't accept a Mars coin within several hours.  

My point is that if there is a lot less cpu power on Mars, then the Mars nodes
will ALWAYS lose the "create the longest block chain" race. So the New York
nodes will ALWAYS have the advantage.  
  
And it is nice to say the New York vending machine "shouldn't accept a Mars
coin within several hours," but, in my experience, "shouldn't" doesn't cut it.
If the New York candy machine CAN make the sale and keep the coins, it WILL.
