  
I'm proposing one new RPC command: 'addmultisigaddress' ... that combines
several public keys into one BIP 13 -style newfangled bitcoin address.  
  
You get the public keys from the 'validateaddress' RPC command, which I've
extended to give the full public key if you give it one of your bitcoin
addresses.  
  
I extended the 'send*' RPC commands so they know how to send to the newfangled
bitcoin addresses, and can send coins you received as multisignature
transactions if you hold all the corresponding private keys (listtransactions
will also show you them, getbalance counts them in your balance, etc). So yes,
anybody can generate new transactions to test...  
  
Alan Reiner is proposing BIP 10 as the 'real' way to get multisignature
transactions signed and spent: https://gist.github.com/1321518  
(no implementation yet, as far as I know).
