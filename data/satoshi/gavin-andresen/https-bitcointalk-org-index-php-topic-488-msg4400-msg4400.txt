There are already a few places in the source code where that is done.  
I think Satoshi's done a darn good job of anticipating future needs. The wire
protocol and database serialization formats both have version numbers, as do
bitcoin addresses. The core transaction mechanism is _very_ flexible (I worry
that it might be too flexible, but that's why we've got the TEST network to
see if we can break it).  
  
I can't think of anything simple that would make it more future-proof. If
you're worried about SHA256 getting broken or the 21quadrillion Bittiestcoins
not being enough... then you worry too much. Stop worrying, you'll just suffer
from analysis paralysis and get nothing done.
