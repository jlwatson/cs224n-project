Determining the "right" fees is a separate issue; see
https://gist.github.com/2961409 for my current thinking.  
  
The raw transaction API will let you create and try to send a transaction with
as much or little fees as you like, but if you try to send a 20 kilobyte
transaction with zero fees you shouldn't be surprised if nobody relays or
mines it.  
  
  
If you use the raw transaction API then you're responsible for saying exactly
where all of the outputs go. If you create a raw transaction with a 50 BTC
input and a 2 BTC output then that is a no-change, 48 BTC fee transaction. If
you don't intend the 48 BTC to go to miners, then you need to specify where
the change goes by adding another output.  
  
I suppose the RPC calls could have limits to try to keep you from shooting
yourself in the foot, but anybody using the raw transaction API should be
doing a lot of testing with worthless testnet coins and I'd rather not start
playing the "lets write lots of code to try to prevent RPC-users from being
dumb" game.
