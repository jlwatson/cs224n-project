Frankly, I'm not sure how I feel about this.  
  
I absolutely positively want more scrutiny of both bitcoin's source code and
the underlying cryptographic concepts.  
  
However, I don't think offering a token amount of money (even in the form of
bitcoins) is appropriate.  
  
A real, professional security review of bitcoin would take a lot of time and a
lot of money. I understand that's not what is being asked, but asking Mr.
Schneier to write about bitcoin is really an irrational "Appeal to Authority"
-- I think he'd say that any cryptography-related technology is never proven
secure, but only gains trust by having multiple people and groups of people
look at it, imagine potential attacks, try to attack it, etc.  
  
Or, in other words, if he writes an article about bitcoin now I think the
summary would be "interesting new technology, doesn't appear to be a scam,
worth keeping an eye on." I think he'll write that article soon without any
prompting from "the bitcoin community," just given the level of buzz bitcoin
is generating the last month or two. I don't think a few hundred bitcoins will
motivate him to write the article any sooner.
