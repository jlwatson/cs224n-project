I'd love to see somebody resurrect the Visual C++ makefile and build
instructions (and let us know if we've accidentally added and gcc-specific
code), so Windows developers didn't have to spin up a VM and cross-compile
everything.  
  
As to why your builds are different: no idea, but you can look at the file-by-
file checksums in the bitcoin-build.assert file to see exactly what is
different.
