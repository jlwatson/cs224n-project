  
Technical growing pains like the ones we're dealing with right now-- IRC
channel filling up so new people are having trouble connecting, BTC/$ going up
so the 0.01BTC transaction fees are too high, etc. There will be more of these
as transaction volume increases, some in the core bitcoin code and more
affecting bitcoin-running websites (who will find they have to upgrade their
servers to handle increased volume/users, etc).  
  
Legal growing pains. I expect somebody doing something illegal and using
bitcoins to help do it will get caught, put in jail, and that will be mis-
reported as "bitcoins are illegal!" I'd say there's a 1 in 5 chance of bitcoin
being made outright illegal in the USA, but I also know that I'm terrible at
accurately predicting stuff.  
  
Security growing pains. My biggest worry is what to do about non-
technologically-savvy people running bitcoin on a virus-infested personal
computer or mobile phone and losing all their bitcoins the first time they
enter their password (I'm assuming their wallet will be password-protected) to
send a couple coins to their friend.  
  
And just plain new-technology growing pains. Expect some (maybe most) bitcoin-
related companies to fail, because most startups fail. Some people will lose
money when they do.  
  
Again, I'm optimistic because there are, and will be, lots of motivated people
working to solve all of these problems, and because I believe the core
technology is solid. But I don't expect smooth sailing.
