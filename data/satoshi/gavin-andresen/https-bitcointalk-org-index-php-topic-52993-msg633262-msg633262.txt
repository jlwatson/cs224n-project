  
0.3.15 is pretty old, and the way you're spending from a copy of the wallet
is, I suspect, confusing it. Pieter updated the wallet code to handle
transactions with partially spent outputs a while back.  
  
Try upgrading to version 0.4.1 or 0.5 and running -rescan and see if your
missing bitcoins reappear.
