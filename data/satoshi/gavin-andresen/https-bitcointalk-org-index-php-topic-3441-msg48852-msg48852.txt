The only way grocery stores could get on the network would be to have some
sort of "MYBITCOIN"-like intermediary that does all the transaction
processing, most of which would have to happen off the block chain.  

  
Right... so then the question is "will the MYBITCOIN-like intermediary be able
to verify transactions quickly without opening themselves up to systematic
fraud."  
  
Without requiring users to pre-deposit funds with them, because users ain't
gonna do that.  
  
Here's another possible simple rule for miners that might work (but, as Hal
said, requires Deep Thought):  
  
"When I see a new block with transactions that I didn't see broadcast
previously, mark those transactions as suspicious. If I see double-spends of
those transactions, stop building on that block-- assume it is cheating.
Switch to the previous block (or alternate block if there's a block race going
on)."  
  
Miners won't try to rip off a grocery store for $50 worth of groceries if
doing so makes their $50+ bitcoin reward for finding a block disappear.  
  
This rule would also give miners a strong incentive to detect and refuse to
include EITHER side of a double-spend in their blocks (if they get both spends
while they're working on the block).
