Time-in-the-future transactions are non-standard (as of 0.8? I can never
remember when things happened...)  
  
Why: because there is a fill-up-memory denial of service attack, and it really
isn't reasonable to expect the entire network to store your timelocked
transactions "forever".  
  
Even in the past, the statement "unspendable by the sender because of
replacement not being implemented" was not true. Wait long enough and only a
subset of the network will have the timelocked transaction (because new nodes,
old nodes restarting, etc). Broadcast a double-spending version without a
timelock and it will get mined fairly soon.
