I've accepted an invitation to do a question and answer session at the Council
on Foreign Relations (CFR) in Washington, DC on Thursday, February 6, 2014.  
  
I've been told anything related to the Council on Foreign Relations tickle's
peoples Grand Conspiracy buttons, so I thought it would be best to be open
about exactly what will happen. I hope it doesn't spark as long a thread as my
visit to the CIA, but Bitcoin is a lot bigger than when I visited the CIA...  
  
Anyway, here's the invitation I received:  
  
  
The format of the event will be a 90-minute question&answer session, moderated
by somebody yet-to-be-determined. It will be "on the record," meaning press
could be invited to attend and recordings and/or transcripts may be posted on
CFR's website.  
  
The audience will be CFR members and invited guests (and maybe press); it is
not open to the public. I am not getting paid by the CFR.
