Yes; my point is miners have more of an incentive to help make a particular currency successful.

Miners have to guess what the price for whatever they are mining will do in the future (and guess what competitors will do) to decide whether to invest in research/development/facilities/chips/power contracts/etc. R&D and chips tend to be currency-specific.

If the price of the currency rises more than they forecast, they profit. If not they might go bankrupt.
