If you don't want to change you can just ignore the new feature(s). There is
zero risk with the proposed changes for anybody running old, un-hacked
versions of bitcoin.  
  
(if you are solo mining and hacked your version of bitcoin to accept 'non-
standard' transactions then you _could_ shoot yourself in your foot, but even
that is unlikely).
