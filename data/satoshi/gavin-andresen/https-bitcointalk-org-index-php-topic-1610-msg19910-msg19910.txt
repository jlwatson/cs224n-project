  
That's not right-- the person paying you doesn't know your public key, they
just know your bitcoin address (which is a 160-bit hash of your public key).  
  
You can (and I have) send bitcoins to ANY 160-bit bitcoin address, whether or
not there actually is a public/private keypair corresponding to that address.
