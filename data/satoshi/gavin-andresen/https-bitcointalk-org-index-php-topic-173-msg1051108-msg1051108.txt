 _backing_ implies a promise to be able to _redeem_ the unit of currency for
something else  

  
In a wisdom-of-crowds system, the _promise_ comes from faith that somebody in
the future will still find bitcoins valuable, and be willing to give you
_something_ in return.  
  
True, it isn't a promise from one particular institution or person to redeem
for one particular something else, so it doesn't fit **your** definition of
'backing.' But I trust The Crowd more than I trust any one particular
institution (especially institutions like governments, who have a long history
of breaking promises).  
  
See my recent "Is store of value enough?" blog post for more thoughts along
these lines.
