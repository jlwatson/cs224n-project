urthermore, I don't think any of us would mind helping law enforcement or in
fact anyone to help and find **real** criminals behind **real** crimes.
Bitcoin is not anonymous - you have to go to great lengths to make it such.  

Exactly right. I will to do what I can to help the police catch scammers and
crooks who want to steal from people. The police might use those same tools
and techniques to help catch people who use bitcoin to pay for drugs; I can't
stop them from doing that.  
  
I personally don't think drugs or gambling should be illegal, because I
believe you should be free to do whatever you like with your own body and your
own money. But I also believe those are separate issues from bitcoin, and if I
felt really strongly about it (it isn't one of my own personal hot-button
issues) I would be donating money to, or volunteering to work for LEAP and
NORML, not mixing "bitcoin is a great new technology" with "drugs should be
legal."
