RE: cryptocards instead of an online service:  
  
Seems like we aught to be able to come up with a protocol that works over the
web or that can talk to http://localhost:SOMEPORT to interact with an attached
smart-card device (there'd be helper software running on localhost:SOMEPORT
that spoke the protocol and relayed to the smart card).  
  
I wanted to start this discussion to make sure we don't re-invent the wheel,
and to think in advance about what changes to core bitcoin (if any) are needed
to support this kinds of functionality.
