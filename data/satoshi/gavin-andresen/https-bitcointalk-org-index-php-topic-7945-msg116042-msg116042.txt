If I were going to implement it... hmm...  
  
I think I'd just special-case the genesis block, so it has a value out of, oh,
I dunno, 20 million CompleCoins. Then maybe fix the mining reward to something
small and constant (say 0.001 CompleCoin per block, forever-- or whatever you
like).  
  
The central authority would create the genesis block, and so would have 20
million CompleCoins that it could issue (aka spend) however it pleased.  
  
The risk would be the central issuer ever losing control of its wallet/private
key. That risk could be mitigated a little bit by occasionally changing the
key by spending all of the non-issued coins to a new address in a new, secure
wallet somewhere and waiting a few blocks for confirmation.  
  
I'm having lunch today with somebody else who is interested in using bitcoin
tech for a centrally issued alternative currency, so I've been thinking a bit
about it...
