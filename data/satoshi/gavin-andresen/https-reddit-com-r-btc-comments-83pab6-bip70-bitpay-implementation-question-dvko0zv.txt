No, I’m not worried. Competition is the best solution to give us the best products and services at the lowest cost.

I’m sure the primary reason BitPay is mandating use of the payment protocol is to reduce their customer support costs. If you want to frame that as ‘greedy corporation trying to increase their profit’ okey-dokey...

But high customer support costs are a symptom that something is broken and needs fixing. We are all better off if cryptocurrency payments get more convenient, reliable and secure.
