Picking up from the original thread...  
  
Bitcoin-related sites that have self-signed or CACert certificates (like
mybitcoin.com) look unprofessional and un-trustworthy to clueless non-techies.  
  
I know, I know, a Verisign-certified certificate isn't _really_ any guarantee
of security, but that doesn't matter-- if you want ordinary users to start
trusting your website, get a certificate that doesn't popup any scary-looking
security warnings.
