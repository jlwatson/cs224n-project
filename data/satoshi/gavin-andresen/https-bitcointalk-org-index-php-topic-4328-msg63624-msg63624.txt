I think you have an incorrect assumption in your argument: what makes you
think there will be a high variability in block rewards (because they're
mostly fees) 40 years from now?  
  
Assuming bitcoin is still around in 40 years, there should be at least tens of
thousands of transactions per block, and with that many transactions sum(fees)
should be pretty darn stable.
