Reposting from email to bitcoin-development mailing list:  
  
I've been busy pulling patches into git HEAD for a Bitcoin version 0.6, with
the goal of having a Release Candidate 1 out in a couple of weeks.  
  
So if you've done all your Christmas shopping and have time to help test, code
review, etc. now would be the time.  
  
Major changes pulled so far:  
  
Implement BIP 11/12/13:  
"Standard" multisignature transactions  
"Standard" OP_EVAL transactions  
OP_EVAL bitcoin addresses  
Implement BIP 14 (separate protocol from client version)  
Private key import/export (RPC commands, not GUI)  
New DNS seeds
