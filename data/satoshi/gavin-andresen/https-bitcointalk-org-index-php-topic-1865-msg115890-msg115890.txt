I'd tweak the formula to be: max block size = 1000000 + (int64)(difficulty)  
  
... just to avoid "if block number is < X max block size = 1000000 else..."
logic. Adding in the current 1MB max limit means all the old blocks are valid
under the new rule.  
  
I like Mike's point that difficulty and transaction volume aren't necessarily
related. Maybe a better formula for miners would be something like:  
  
max block size = 1000000 + (average size of last N blocks in the best chain)  
... where N is maybe 144 (smooth over 24-hours of transactions)  
  
Anybody have access to what Visa daily transaction volume looks like in the
days around Christmas? Are there huge, sudden spikes that the above formula
wouldn't handle?
