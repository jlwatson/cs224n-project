Does that sound better?  

  
Yup, although I'd like more brains to think it through-- are there any
potential denial-of-service attacks if bitcoin is listening for RPC commands
by default (note that JavaScript in your web browser CAN access
http://localhost:8332/, the same-origin-policy for JavaScript doesn't apply to
localhost URLs)?  
  
Does it open up any extra security holes if you're on a multi-user system?  
  
And I don't think it should go into mainline bitcoin until there is a
compelling need for it-- and I don't think there will be a need until the
'click on a link, popup payment dialog from bitcoin' functionality is worked
out...
