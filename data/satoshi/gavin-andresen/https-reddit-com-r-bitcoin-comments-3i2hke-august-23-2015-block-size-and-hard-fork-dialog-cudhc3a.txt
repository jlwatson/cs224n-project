New block propagation must be fast or miners will choose to create smaller blocks.

As for attacks: straight-up selfish mining with >30% hash rate using small blocks should be a much more viable and profitable attack than some convoluted combination of huge blocks full of never-before-seen transactions and  control over network topology and assumptions about peer behavior (e.g. If your attack requires sending to 30% of hashpower AND that peers do full block validation before relaying or building on a block, then that attack is trivially thwarted by immediately relaying all blocks with valid POW or mining an empty block on top of new blocks before they are fully validated).  (.... Although just penalizing blocks that take a long time to validate by refusing to build on them for a few minutes after validation is done might work nicely, too)
