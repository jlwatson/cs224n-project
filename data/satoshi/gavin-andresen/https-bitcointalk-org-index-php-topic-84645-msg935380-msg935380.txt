  
Ummm....  
  
When you run something like:

Code:

bitcoind getinfo

  
... bitcoind creates a network connection to localhost:rpcport and talks to
the running bitcoind process via the JSON-RPC protocol.  
  
So it doesn't matter what user the

Code:

bitcoind getinfo

process is running as, what matters is securing access to the JSON-RPC network
port, keeping the rpcpassword a secret, and preventing attackers from getting
in and copying wallet.dat.
