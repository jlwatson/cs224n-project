no run bitcoind under it's own user but you still need to have access to it to
send commands those should be done only on root  

  
Ummm....  
  
When you run something like:

Code:

bitcoind getinfo

  
... bitcoind creates a network connection to localhost:rpcport and talks to
the running bitcoind process via the JSON-RPC protocol.  
  
So it doesn't matter what user the

Code:

bitcoind getinfo

process is running as, what matters is securing access to the JSON-RPC network
port, keeping the rpcpassword a secret, and preventing attackers from getting
in and copying wallet.dat.
