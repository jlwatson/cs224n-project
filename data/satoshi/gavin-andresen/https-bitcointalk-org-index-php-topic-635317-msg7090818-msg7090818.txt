In order to acquire a certificate (which you need to sign the payment requests
with), you must leave your personal details at a CA.  
Your full name, your email, where you live, even your phone number.  

  
You are going back on my ignore list, because you have no idea what you are
talking about.  
  
Maybe if I use simple, easy-to-follow steps I can convince you that you are
wrong:  
  
1\. Copy and paste this URL into your web browser:  
http://www.comodo.com/home/email-security/free-email-certificate.php  
  
2\. Click on the "Free email certificate: sign up now" button (the big orange
one).  
  
3\. Enter whatever name you like, and a valid email address (an anonymous one,
if you like) and a revocation password.  
  
I just used "knownothingtroll@mailinator.com" to make sure it actually does
work to give a fake name, anonymous email address (and no address or phone
number).  
  
Done deal, you've now got a certificate-authority-signed X.509 certificate for
an anonymous email address that you can use for the payment protocol.  
  
That wasn't so hard, was it?
