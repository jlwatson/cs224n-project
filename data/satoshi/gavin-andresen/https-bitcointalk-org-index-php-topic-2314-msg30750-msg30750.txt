Outputting the transaction time would be easy.  
  
"The address that received funds" is not as obvious as you might think. It is
possible to generate transactions that are split and go to several addresses
(well, it is possible if you use your own custom client, standard Bitcoin
doesn't expose that feature).  
  
Some or all of those addresses might be yours, and might be associated with
any number of accounts.  
  
I see two possible ways of dealing with this:  
  
1\. Generate multiple entries for a single transaction. E.g. if you receive a
split transactions, where 50 BTC goes to address '1aaa...' and 10 to address
'1bbbb...', listtransactions will list that as two separate entries that share
the same txid:  

Code:

{  
"category" : "receive",  
"amount" : 50.00000000,  
"txid" : "2c9d43db0142130a9926ef4b1c58abf17e8b4dfd2148bf2072b0df6d2bac8789",  
"toaddress" : "1aaa", ... etc, irrelevant fields omitted...  
},  
{  
"category" : "receive",  
"amount" : 10.00000000,  
"txid" : "2c9d43db0142130a9926ef4b1c58abf17e8b4dfd2148bf2072b0df6d2bac8789",  
"toaddress" : "1bbb", ...  
},  

  
You can already get two separate entries for one transaction if you send to
yourself, so this might be the best answer. And it makes the common case
simpler.  
  
2\. Or maybe 'toaddress' should be address:amount pairs, like this:  

Code:

{  
"category" : "receive",  
"amount" : 60.00000000,  
"txid" : "2c9d43db0142130a9926ef4b1c58abf17e8b4dfd2148bf2072b0df6d2bac8789",  
"toaddress" : { "1aaa" : 50.000000, "1bbb" : 10.000000 }  
},  

  
Writing all this down, I'm thinking that listtransactions aught to generate
multiple entries, but gettransaction aught to generate address:amount pairs
(and still omit category/account, as it does now).
