No no no no no....  (you just poked one of my pet peeves)

Economists call this "confusing stock and a flow".

It IS confusing, because the mining reward consists of new-bitcoin-creation (25 btc: the stock being created) plus fees (maybe 0.1 btc-- a flow, nothing is created, fees flow to miners and then get spent to maybe be used as fees, again and again).

It's just wrong to take the 25 bitcoin stock that is being created and divide by transactions-- which are a flow (there's no limit to the number of transactions or the total fees that will be paid over time). It makes no sense as a measurement.

A physicist would call it an error in dimensional analysis...
