How big is your wallet?  
  
getbalance() is O(N) where N is the total number of transactions in the
wallet. (actually, it can be even worse than O(N) if you have long chains of
unconfirmed transactions in your wallet)  
  
"Patches welcome" to fix that, I expected one of the big bitcoind-using
services would submit a performance fix patch long ago.
