Yes, I think Bitcoin can surpass this. There are other problems with the way
that scalability is limited than the block size to get there, this is just
one.  
And we agree on the purpose of the block size limit. Just not on how to set
it.  
  
You don't know what the future market will look like. You don't know what
bandwidth or storage will be available. Neither do I or anyone else.  

  
When you respond to me saying patronizing things like "there are other
problems with the way scalability is limited," I have trouble not thinking you
are either confused or insane. Or just lazy, and did not read my "Scalability
Roadmap" blog post.  
  
It is certainly true that nobody can predict the future with 100% accuracy. We
might get hit by an asteroid before I finish this sentence. (whew! didn't!)  
  
But extrapolating current trends seems to me to be the best we can do-- we are
just as likely to be too conservative as too aggressive in our assumptions.
