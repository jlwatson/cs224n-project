For the layman, I submit that bitcoin sounds no less kooky than Time Cube
(okay, maybe a little less kooky, at least the website styling doesn't burn
your eyes and people write in grammatical sentences).

"So Gavin, what are you working on these days?"  
  
"A really exciting project that is... well, OUT THERE. My wife calls it my
'pretend money project,' but I'm wearing really nice wool socks that I bought
with my pretend money."

  
People who know me aren't shocked that I'm working on something wild and
crazy, and by saying up front "this is a wild and crazy idea that may or may
not work" I think they're more likely to really think about whether or not
bitcoin makes sense.
