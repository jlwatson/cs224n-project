Honestly, I don't think the future of bitcoin is running "heavy" nodes on our
personal computers.  
  
I think the vast majority of people will be using bitcoin through web or
mobile apps in the not-too-distant future. So I'm not personally inclined to
put a lot of effort into splitting the node and wallet, unless that makes
creating lightweight web and mobile apps easier.  
  
That said, the new QT gui does a much, much better job of letting you know
what bitcoin is doing, both during initial startup and initial blockchain
download.
