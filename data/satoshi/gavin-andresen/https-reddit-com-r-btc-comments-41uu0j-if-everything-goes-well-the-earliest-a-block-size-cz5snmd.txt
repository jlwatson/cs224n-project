No, it doesn't reduce transaction size.

Smallest possible transaction is something like 150 bytes (one-input one-output single signature using just OP_CHECKSIG).  Makes that segwit and you add another  20 bytes (30 bytes if you want or need extra crypto security).

Those extra on-the-wire bytes could be optimized away, but BIP144 doesn't do that-- it would make the network message handling code significantly more complicated.
