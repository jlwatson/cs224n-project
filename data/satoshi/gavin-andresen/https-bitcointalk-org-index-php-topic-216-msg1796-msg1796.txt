Scheduling should be easy; on Linux, just run a couple of 'at' jobs that
either talk to Bitcoin via bitcoind command-line arguments or use curl to turn
on/off coin generation.  
  
Windows and Mac have similar, built-in abilities to schedule commands.  
  
I think less time, effort, and attention should be paid to coin generation,
and more to making bitcoin as easy to use as possible for trading.
