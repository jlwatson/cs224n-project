  
Very nice!  
  
Is there a standard spot to put the build descriptor file in the source tree,
or a standard name for it? I'd like to commit the build descriptor file.  
  
bitcoinex: I'll tag the tree when I think we have a release candidate. There
are still a few loose ends I hope to tie up today:  
  
1\. New -testnet genesis block.  
2\. New block chain lock-in point. I'm thinking block 105,000 is a good
candidate for the lock-in point.  
3\. Compile/run/sanity test on Windows. I am planning on spinning up an Amazon
EC2 Windows instance to create a build/testing environment (although probably
a VMWare image would be better-- can anybody help with this? I normally don't
do windows).  
  
Am I missing anything else stopping a 0.3.20 release candidate?
