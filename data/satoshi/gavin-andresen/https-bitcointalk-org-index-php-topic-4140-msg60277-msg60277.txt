Seems like it would be useful if the GUI client had an option similar to the
bitcoind "sendfrom" functionality. Do you think this would be impossible to
try and get into the client? Am I just wasting my time?  I'm willing to do the
work and write some code for review, but I don't want to go down that road if
it's something everyone would basically vote down at review time.  

  
I wouldn't have any objections to changes that let you decide which input
transactions or receiving addresses to choose when sending coins, as long as
it is well-tested, follows the coding guildelines (see coding.txt in the
source directory) and it doesn't make the "I just want to send some coins"
case look more complicated (maybe hide it behind an Advanced... button in the
Send dialog).
