  
I wouldn't have any objections to changes that let you decide which input
transactions or receiving addresses to choose when sending coins, as long as
it is well-tested, follows the coding guildelines (see coding.txt in the
source directory) and it doesn't make the "I just want to send some coins"
case look more complicated (maybe hide it behind an Advanced... button in the
Send dialog).
