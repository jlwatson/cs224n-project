I'm a terrible leader because I HATE telling people what to do.

If you insist on paddling your canoe upstream when there is free bus available that gets you there 100 times faster... okey dokey. I'm not going to force you to get on the bus, even if I think there is a pretty good chance there is a waterfall a couple miles upstream.

I'm glad more and more hash power is getting on the bus.
