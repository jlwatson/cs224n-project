  
No, not "everybody" -- if it is too expensive for you, then you stop doing it.
Only the people who can generate most efficiently will stick around, and
they'll stop "going hard" when the cost of adding more generating hardware is
more than the value of the bitcoins they get.  
  
Hopefully bitcoins will become more valuable over time (that will happen if
people find them useful/valuable).  
  
  
Mostly no, total value of the transaction doesn't matter. A large-value
transaction that is made up of lots of little transactions is more expensive
to verify, but so is a small-value transaction made up of lots of tiny
transactions. And for both, if they're big enough they'll have to include a
transaction fee to get accepted.
