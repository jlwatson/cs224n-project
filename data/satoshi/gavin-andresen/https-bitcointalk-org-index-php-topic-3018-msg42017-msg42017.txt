I made a google spreadsheet with the number of transactions occurring in the
bitcoin block chain per month, and the total value of those transactions:

(click on the BitcoinTransactions spreadsheet; the first is just another
version of #produced over time)  
  
Looks like bitcoin is growing nicely; I'm not sure why the big spikes in July
and October...  
  
I made the calculations using my bitcointools python code:
