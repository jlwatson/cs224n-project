So I'm wondering, is there any better way to get the input addresses on a
transaction?  

  
As was pointed out, getrawtransaction <txid> 1 will do the decode for you.  
  
If your JSON-RPC library supports it, you could also use a 'batch' request to
get all of the inputs in one round-trip. See
http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch
