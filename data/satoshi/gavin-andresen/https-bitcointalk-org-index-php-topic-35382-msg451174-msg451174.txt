Half-baked thoughts on transaction relaying (I agree that it may become a
major problem because there are no incentives to properly relay transactions
right now):  
  
I think writing code to reliably detect that a peer isn't relaying
transactions is possible. Something like:  
Generating a new transaction:  
Pick a connected peer at random "P"  
Relay new transaction to all nodes EXCEPT P  
If, after a little while, P doesn't tell us about our new transaction then it
is likely P is not relaying properly.  
(assumption is that we are not P's only connection, and it will get the
transaction from its other peers)  
  
And I think something like the above could be one of the metrics used to
measure "ill-behaving peers" (other metrics might be number of double-spend
transactions or orphan blocks received, number of spammy-looking transactions
received, etc). If a peer is too ill-behaved, the penalty could be shunning--
drop its connection and add its IP to a temporary refuse-connections list.  
  
(maybe lesser penalties make sense, too-- maybe order-of-relaying is based on
good behavior, so the code announces new blocks/transactions to better-behaved
peers fore worse-behaved peers).  
  
If cheating miners find themselves disconnected from the rest of the network,
that is a strong incentive not to cheat.  
  
I'd really like somebody with a lot more network design experience than me to
run some simulations and see what network behavior would be like with/without
rules like I'm proposing. Or tell me that disconnecting ill-behaving nodes is
a terrible idea because it makes it easy for an attacker to shatter the
network into a gazillion pieces...
