All serious institutions (like banks) never use floats for currency
calculations because they know the dangers.  
If we want to be seen as "serious", float is not an option.  

  
You know, I was looking at the PayPal payment API yesterday, and $1.01 is sent
as... 1.01  
  
"transmitting" != "calculations"
