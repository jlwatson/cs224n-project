  
The standard answer is if the river is owned, then the owner(s) of the river
will have the right incentives to keep it unpolluted. See, for example:
http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj1n2-6.html  
  
If you care about clean rivers, then buy them (or donate money to an
organization that buys them; the Nature Conservancy is one of my favorite
charities).  
  
It is the Chinese government's river, not the free market's, why are they
tolerating all the pollution?  
  
Global Warming and air pollution is a stickier problem because nobody owns the
climate or the air we breathe, and nobody CAN own them. Personally, I think we
do actually need good government for some things, which is why I describe
myself as "mostly libertarian".  
  
And if I were King, I think I'd implement the Cato Institute's suggestion and
give all of our National Parks and public wilderness to private environmental
organizations to take care of (or sell, if they decided they could put the
money to better use for something else).
