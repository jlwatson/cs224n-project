You know what? Screw global warming for now. How would a libertarian society
handle the current level of water poisoning? Fish are dying out, more and more
beaches fill with algae, rivers are full of waste (from detergents to
artificial manure) etc. None of these things visibly influence businesses that
make the mess. How free should this market stay?  

  
The standard answer is if the river is owned, then the owner(s) of the river
will have the right incentives to keep it unpolluted. See, for example:
http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj1n2-6.html  
  
If you care about clean rivers, then buy them (or donate money to an
organization that buys them; the Nature Conservancy is one of my favorite
charities).  
  
It is the Chinese government's river, not the free market's, why are they
tolerating all the pollution?  
  
Global Warming and air pollution is a stickier problem because nobody owns the
climate or the air we breathe, and nobody CAN own them. Personally, I think we
do actually need good government for some things, which is why I describe
myself as "mostly libertarian".  
  
And if I were King, I think I'd implement the Cato Institute's suggestion and
give all of our National Parks and public wilderness to private environmental
organizations to take care of (or sell, if they decided they could put the
money to better use for something else).
