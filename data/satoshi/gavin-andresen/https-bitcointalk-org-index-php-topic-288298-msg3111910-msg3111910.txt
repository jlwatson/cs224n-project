There was an interesting research paper (which I can't find) that claimed that
high frequency trading is largely driven by the artifically high limit on
bid/ask spreads. The claim is that if trading was allowed in much smaller
fractions of a dollar traders would compete by underbidding/overoffering
instead of competing to be first in the trading queue.  
  
That seems plausible to me-- set an arbitrary constraint ("bids must be in
multiples of a tenth of a penny" -- or whatever it is these days) and you
often get unintended consequences.  
  
I still plan on writing up why I disagree with the idea that a larger block
size will lead to centralization, but I'm working on some higher priority
things first. I really don't understand why you would think that our current,
arbitrary 1MB limit is the Best Size For All Time. I think **that** arbitrary
constraint will have bad unintended consequences.
