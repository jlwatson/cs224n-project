  
So what happens if I put two OP_P2SH's in a scriptPubKey? What happens if I
put one in a scriptSig? What if I put it inside an OP_IF ... OP_ENDIF ?  
  
I think you're really just suggesting that the "magic" scriptPubKey be 24
bytes big instead of 23, and start with one of the NOP opcodes-- yes? In which
case there is going to be a special case code path anyway.
