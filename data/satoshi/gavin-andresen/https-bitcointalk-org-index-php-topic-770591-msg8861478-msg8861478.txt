I am not the best person to discuss the technical details here, but how do you
explain PoW altcoins are easily 51% attacked to death. But then PoS altcoins
all avoided this fate, and most of them (the non scammy ones), works and works
well. Clearly when put in a equal competition (altcoins), the PoS system came
out on top in an equal competitive environment (without early start advantage
etc...).  

  
I think we'll see non-clone coins being broken after two things happen:  
  
1\. They become valuable enough for attackers to bother, and there is some way
for them to cash out.  
2\. The attackers have some time to do what they need to do to mount an
attack-- write code, deploy botnets, hack into some big exchange(s), get their
hands on some early-adopter's wallet backups, or whatever.  
  
Once the tools and techniques are developed, then I think we'll see what we
see in PoW 51% attacks: attacks against even mostly-worthless clonecoins,
because if they've already got the tools then they might just attack for the
lulz.  
  
I'm surprised you count peercoin a PoS success-- they're still running with
centralized checkpoints, aren't they?
