See https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proper_Money_Handling_(JSON-RPC) for relevant
advice.  
  
As Pieter says, bitcoin converts all user-entered values and JSON-RPC values
to fixed-point 64-bit integers as soon as it gets them. All calculations
except for that conversion are done using 64-bit integers.  
  
Bitcoin does not "use floating point", it parses numbers-containing-a-decimal-
point values that come from JSON (the Number type in JSON is double-precision
float; let's not restart the "we should pass numbers as strings in JSON"
debate, please, there are several long threads from a couple of months ago
about that) or from the GUI.
