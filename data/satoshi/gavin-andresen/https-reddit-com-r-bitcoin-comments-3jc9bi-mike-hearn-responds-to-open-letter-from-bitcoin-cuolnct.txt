If by "desired levels of usage" you mean "infinite usage", then okey dokey, there is some level of transaction volume that even Google and it's datacenters would not be able to handle.

But if you mean "capable of handling the current level of worldwide electronic payment volume" then I must strongly disagree. We certainly CAN scale up that far and remain at least as decentralized as we are today.

If you don't think it can be done, again, okey dokey. I'd just ask: do you always assume problems are impossible if you, personally, can't figure out how to solve them?
