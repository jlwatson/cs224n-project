If that holds shouldn't Payment Protocol's use of CA be revisited?  

  
No. If their anonymous credential scheme is successful (and I hope it is!),
then the payment protocol should be extended to use it. The payment protocol
is quite carefully designed so that replacing the public key infrastructure
system is easy.
