If a government has the capability to exert control...  

So far, I think the pace of technological change has outrun governments'
ability to figure out how to use it to exert control.  
  
Maybe governments will get more nimble, but I'm going to continue betting that
entrepreneurs and individuals will continue to widen the gap between the new
freedoms that technology enables and what the law allows.  
  
RE: multisignature transaction dangers: I'm completely convinced the (large,
practical) benefits far outweigh the (small, theoretical) risks that it'll be
abused by some repressive government(s).
