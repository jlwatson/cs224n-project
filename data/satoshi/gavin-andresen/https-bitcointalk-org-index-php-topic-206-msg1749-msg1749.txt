"flawed" ??  
  
I've been telling people it is a half-baked, I've-lost-my-friggin-mind idea!  
  
So far, I count it as a big success-- I've learned a lot that will help me
with my next Bitcoin-related project, I've made a bunch of people a teeny-tiny
bit happier, and I've personally invested just under $1.00 worth of bitcoins
over the last two weeks.  
  
I did throw in the towel today and turned on reCAPTCHA for everybody getting
bitcoins (it looks like somebody DID bother to write a robot to harvest coins
through proxies). It was fun trying to come up with new, creative ways of
detecting cheating, but I have more important things to work on.
