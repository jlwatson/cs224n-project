Playing devil's advocate for a moment:  
  
"Security theater" is popular. It makes people feel safer. Bitcoin-the-program
will probably be more popular if it asks for a password before sending and
there is a bullet-point on the feature list: "State of the art AES-256
encryption."  
  
I believe TrueCrypt is open source; maybe it would be easy to use their
password handling / encryption code in bitcoin. Anybody here looked at their
code?
