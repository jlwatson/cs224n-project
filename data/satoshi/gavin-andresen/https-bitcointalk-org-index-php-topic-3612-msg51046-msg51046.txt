I've made public the windows, linux32 and linux64 Amazon Machine Images used
to build bitcoin 0.3.20. If you have an Amazon EC2 account, you can launch
them and have your own working build environment for linux or windows bitcoin
(paid for by the hour).  
  
They are:  
ami-4adf2c23 32-bit Linux (Ubuntu 9.04)  
ami-12df2c7b 64-bit Linux (Ubuntu 9.04)  
ami-7a21d213 Windows (with MinGW)  
  
All created in the us-east-1b zone (I don't know if Amazon automatically
migrates public AMIs across the world).  
  
After launching the Linux VMs, you login as root (using the ssh keypair you
specify when you launch).  
  
After launching the Windows VM, you connect via Remote Desktop and then login
as Administrator, password "bitcoin development" (you should change that for
your instance as soon as you login, of course).  
  
They contain bitcoin, bitcoind, and everything needed to build them, already
built. You could launch instances and try to generate coins, but that's not
cost-effective.
