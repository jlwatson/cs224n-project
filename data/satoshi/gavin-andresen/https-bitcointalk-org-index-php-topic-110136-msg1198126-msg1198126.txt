If you're running Bitcoin-Qt on a Mac, what version of OSX are you running?  
  
I'm trying to get an idea of how many people are still running 10.5, because
supporting that version of OSX is starting to become painful (it is almost 5
years old now...).  
  
And before somebody asks: yes, signing the Bitcoin-Qt app so it plays nicely
with 10.8's "Gatekeeper" is near the top of the TODO list.
