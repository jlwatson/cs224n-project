Additionally, bitcoin isn't meant for micropayments.  

It was my understanding that it was, in fact, meant for micropayments,
especially since 1 BTC exceeds $10 now.  

  
Depends on your definition of "micropayment". Bitcoin is not suitable for
transactions of less than a US penny, because of its fixed costs of processing
transactions.
