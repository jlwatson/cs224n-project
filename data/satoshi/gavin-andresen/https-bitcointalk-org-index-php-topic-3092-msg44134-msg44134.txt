Okay, let us consider that scenario. Step by step, just to make sure we are on
the same page:  

  * The Bitcoind daemon knows of transactions [A, B, C, D] with timestamps [T1, T1, T2, T2].
  * Upon first invocation, the client asks for a list of all transactions. It receives [A, B, C, D] (and timestamps) as response.
  * There's a block chain re-org invalidating [C, D].

  
No, there is a block chain re-org invalidating B and C. D is still valid in my
scenario.  
  
So the client remains oblivious to B and C being invalid, whether it asks for
transactions older than T2 or transactions after D.
