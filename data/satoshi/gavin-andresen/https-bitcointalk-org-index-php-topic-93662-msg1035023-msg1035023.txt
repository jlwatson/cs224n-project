You'll be able to run as a 'hidden service' that is advertised to other nodes
running on the Tor network and get incoming Tor connections in the next

See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/Tor.txt for details
(send thanks to Pieter Wuille for doing the work).  
  
RE: hard drive space: Pieter has been busy optimizing HD usage, too
("ultraprune"), but that work isn't finished yet.
