I've been struggling recently to keep ClearCoin moving forward while I also
try to keep core bitcoin on track, and with all the demands on my time I can't
spend the time on ClearCoin to make it a project that I'm really proud of.  
  
So in the next day or two I'll stop allowing the creation of new escrow
transactions. Existing transactions will be unaffected, and I'll keep
ClearCoin running for at least two months after the last active transaction
has expired.  
  
I hope ClearCoin will be back at some point in the future, but I won't bring
it back until a lot of behind-the-scenes work is done to make it a robust,
scalable business.
