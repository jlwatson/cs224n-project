Meh.  
  
Lots of other ways that merchants could arrange to pay transaction fees, I
don't think we need a hard fork to solve that problem.  
  
E.g. : child-pays-for-parent.  
  
Or an extension to the payment protocol so the merchant provides an already-
signed SIGHASH_SINGLE / SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY input to pay the fee that the
client includes as the first input in the transaction.
