What I mean is, if some dude approaches you on the street and asks for a $100
loan with 5% compounding monthly, would you give it to him?  
  
So, whatever investment interests you, think first **"Would I put cash in an
envelope and mail it to their untraceable anonymous PO box?"**

I still hope the Bitcoin world will be boring in 4 or 5 years, but I expect
lots more chaos and drama until at least then. This is what innovation looks
like-- lots of failures and a few spectacular successes.  
  
It is still WAY too early to tell what will be successful long-term.
