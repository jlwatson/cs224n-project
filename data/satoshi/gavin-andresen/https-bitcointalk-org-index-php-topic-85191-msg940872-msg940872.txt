That may very well be, but I'm generally surprised  
to see that a testnet "reset" has so many dependencies  
left on the old chain.  
  
Would it be possible to have bitcoin-qt refuse  
all testnet packets from a peer that identifies  
as being below a certain version ?  

Yes... but having peers with a completely different block chain from you
connect is a good way to shake out obscure bugs. Like Bitcoin-Qt's "how many
blocks are in the valid chain" code getting fooled...
