I just tagged the git tree "v0.5.0rc1". If you are able, please compile and
help test.  
  
See the INSTALL file at the top of the source tree for instructions on
compiling. Binary releases for at least unix and mac should be available in
the next day or two (there is a show-stopper bug on Windows, and we could use
help from people familiar with cross-compiling using mingw to update the
Windows build process).  
  
Major bugs you should be aware of:  
  
Wallet does not relock on Win32  
  
Major changes from version 0.4:  
  
Switched from wxWidgets for the GUI to Qt, using Wladimir J. van der Laan's
bitcoin-qt. Why? We didn't have any wxWidgets programmers contributing fixes
or improvements.  
  
New JSON-RPC commands:  
  
getmemorypool : alternative to 'getwork' that provides everything needed to
construct a block with a custom generation transaction.  
listsinceblock : Get all transactions in blocks since block [blockid]  
signmessage/verifymessage : sign/verify a message with a wallet public/private
keypair  
  
Deprecated JSON-RPC features:  
'midstate' data item from getwork requests  
  
Deprecated JSON-RPC commands that have been REMOVED:  
setlabel  
getlabel  
getaddressesbylabel  
getamountreceived  
getallreceived  
getreceivedbylabel  
listreceivedbylabel  
  
Run: git shortlog --no-merges v0.4.0..  
... to get a complete list of changes, and thanks to everybody who is
contributing!
