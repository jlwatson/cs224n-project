Hmm, both of those rely on Unix shell commands and redirection. I was hoping
for something like a PID file..  

  
I pulled a patch that makes Linux/Mac bitcoin/bitcoind write a bitcoind.pid
file when started with the -daemon switch (and erases it on shutdown).  
  
Next release will have several changes to make startup on Linux/Mac more unix-
standard-like.
