Does the payment, after I've released it from ClearCoin escrow, show the
bitcoin address from my wallet as the origin? Or does ClearCoin simply send
from its wallet balance and thus there's no direct link between my address
when I sent the funds to escrow and the payment after it was released from
escrow?  

  
It sends it from the ClearCoin wallet. It doesn't do anything special to try
to 'mix' coins, though, so if you send ClearCoin exactly 11 bitcoins and then
release exactly 11 it is pretty likely the transaction history would be easy
to figure out.  
  
Which reminds me... I released a new version of ClearCoin this week that lets
you release an arbitrary amount. So if you wanted to pay somebody 11 bitcoins
but make it hard to figure out where the payment came from by looking at the
transaction histories you could:  
  
Fund the escrow account with, oh, I don't know, 20 bitcoins.  
Release 11.  
Let the escrow expire, and you'll be sent the leftover 9.
