TED is about "the vision thing"; somebody really good at public speaking and
putting together compelling presentations should do it.  
  
Somebody who actually **enjoys** travelling around and speaking about
something they are passionate about. I want to spend my time building stuff,
not talking about stuff.  
  
PS: I think bitcoin needs another year of growth before it is TED-worthy.
