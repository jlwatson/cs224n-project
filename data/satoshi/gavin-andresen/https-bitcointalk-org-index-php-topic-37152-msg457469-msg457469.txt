Now, after having filled my target address B and amount of BTC in the "send"
field of my client software, I am able to compose a message (=free text, like
an SMS) and the client will encrypt this message with the public key of B
(i.e. with the destination address) in the way that normally emails are
encrypted with PGP public key mechanisms.  

  
Bitcoin addresses are not public keys-- they are hashes of public keys (RIPE-
MD-160 hash of the SHA256 hash of the public key, with a version number and
checksum, to be annoyingly specific).  
  
I agree that associating a message with a bitcoin transaction would be spiffy.
