The only problem I see is that firstbits lookup requires full blockchain scan,
which is sort of expensive.  

  
"sort of expensive" ? Really expensive and getting more expensive all the
time. And absolutely impossible for a lightweight hardware or mobile-phone
wallet, which I think a lot of people will use as their second-factor device.
