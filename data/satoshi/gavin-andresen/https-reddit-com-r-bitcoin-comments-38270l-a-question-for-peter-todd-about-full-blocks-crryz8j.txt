That is why wallets don't let you send dust of spammy feeless transactions.

The question is, are wallets ready for ordinary reasonable-fee-paying transactions taking a long time to confirm (or never confirming)?

I was worried about this for Bitcoin Core, so I implemented the first version of the fee estimation code (it has since been improved by Mike Hearn and Alex Morcos).

But most people aren't running the Bitcoin Core wallet, because SPV wallets or web-hosted wallets are more convenient and/or more secure.
