Not yet. There is a pull request implementing bloom filters that should make
that easy to implement.  
No. The reference implementation doesn't keep a master map of all addresses to
unspent transaction outputs, and adding such an index for the small number of
services that need to look up arbitrary addresses doesn't make sense.  
  
I'd suggest you -blocknotify and the getblock() RPC call to maintain your own
index of address --> unspent txout.
