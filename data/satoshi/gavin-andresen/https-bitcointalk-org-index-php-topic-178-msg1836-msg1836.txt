 **Abstract.** We present a reputation scheme for a pseudonymous peer-to-peer
(P2P) system in an anonymous network. Misbehavior is one of the biggest
problems in pseudonymous P2P systems, where there is little incentive for
proper behavior. In our scheme, using ecash for reputation points, the
reputation of each user is closely related to his real identity rather than to
his current pseudonym. Thus, our scheme allows an honest user to switch to a
new pseudonym keeping his good reputation, while hindering a malicious user
from erasing his trail of evil deeds with a new pseudonym.
