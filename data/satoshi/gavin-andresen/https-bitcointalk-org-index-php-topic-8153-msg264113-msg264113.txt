I don't want to keep putting band-aids on the transaction fee problem, so I'm
against adding Yet Another Button to the client.  
  
If you're impatient and can't stand the thought of paying half-a-millibitcoin
for a transaction, then compile your own version of bitcoin. Just don't
complain if you end up with a wallet full of 0/unconfirmed transactions that
tie up all your funds.
