I'm interested in the project and have developed a patch and until I found
this email I had no clue how to submit it. Can I suggest that a development
overview page be created wiki https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page to house
this sort of instructions. Maybe something like
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Development with links from the wiki Main_Page and
the main website.  

Done. Please feel free to make it better.

Another thing to point out is where tickets should be opened. I tried for
quite a while to find ticket tracking on the sourceforge site. There should
probably also be a link from the sourceforge site to github.  

  
Good idea.
