I exchanged email with Jacob, and he's predicting bugs because some very good
"white-hat" people are looking hard at the code, trying to find bugs or
vulnerabilities.  
  
That's all. And that's good news; the more people who try to find problems
with the code (and who will report any problems responsibly so they can get
fixed before they're exploited), the better.
