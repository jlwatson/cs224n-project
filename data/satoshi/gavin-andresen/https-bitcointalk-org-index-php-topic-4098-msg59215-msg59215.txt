Please help test: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/95  
  
Sets the -maxsendbuffer and -maxreceivebuffer limits to 10MB each (so possible
max of 2GB of memory if you had 100 connections).  
  
I tested by running a 0.3.20 node to act as server, then ran a client with:  
-connect={server_ip} -noirc -nolisten  
... to make sure I was downloading the block chain from that 0.3.20 node.
