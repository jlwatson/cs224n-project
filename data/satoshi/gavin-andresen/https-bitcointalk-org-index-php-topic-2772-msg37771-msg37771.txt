The list of possible new features and bugs at
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues is getting longer every day; I'd
like to see the bugs resolved before the bug list gets so long we all just
start ignoring it.  
  
So: who is willing and able to help out? Don't ask permission, just jump in,
grab a bug that catches your interest, add comments to it as you start to
figure out what the problem is (or isn't), and submit a PULL request when you
have a fix.  
  
Your reward will be recognition, admiration and respect. It is time to take
bitcoin from, essentially, a single-programmer project to a robust open source
project with lots of contributors.
