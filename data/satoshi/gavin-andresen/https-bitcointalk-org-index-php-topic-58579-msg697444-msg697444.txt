  
notme is exactly right; the change is backwards-compatible, pool users don't
have to do anything.  
  
Pools and solo miners should upgrade, or they run a (very small) risk that
they'll waste time hashing a block that can't be valid.  
  
The risk is very small because it requires that somebody mine a block
containing a /P2SH/ transaction that is valid-under-the-old-rules, invalid-
under-the-new. That won't happen by accident, somebody malicious will have to
create such a transaction and then find a miner who is willing to put that
non-standard transaction in their block (and is willing to create a block they
know the network will reject).  
  
They would spend a lot of time (and therefore money) on an attack that would
do nothing but slow down transaction confirmations a tiny bit and maybe trip
up some random, unlucky mining pool or solo miner who didn't bother upgrading.  
  
  
  
Gory details if you're not already bored:  
  
Old miners and clients will ignore all /P2SH/ transactions; they won't relay
them to other nodes and won't put them in blocks they mine, because they're
non-standard. So an attacker can't broadcast an invalid /P2SH/ transaction and
hope it gets included in a block; they'll have to mine a block themself, or
partner with a big solo miner or pool who is willing to produce bad blocks.  
  
If an attacker DID manage to create a block with a timestamp after the
switchover date and a bad /P2SH/ transaction in it, then some percentage of
the network will try to build on that bad block. Lets say 70% of hashing power
supports /P2SH/. That would mean only 70% of the network was working on a good
block-chain, and the result would be transactions taking, on average, about 14
minutes to confirm instead of the usual 10 minutes.  
  
In other words: they'd give up a $300 block reward and manage to just give the
network a tiny little hiccup.
