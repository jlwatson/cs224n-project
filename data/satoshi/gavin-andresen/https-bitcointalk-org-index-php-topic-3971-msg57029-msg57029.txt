80 transactions per second is 6.9 million transactions per day. That is a LOT.  
  
PayPal was doing about 2 million transactions per day in 2008; if there are
three times as many bitcoin transactions as PayPal transactions in a few years
that would be a very good problem to have, and I'm confident "we" would figure
out how to deal with lots of transactions.
