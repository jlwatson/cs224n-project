A Radeon 6990 has 4 gigabytes of ram.  
  
If the task is "find a number that bcrypts/scrypts to less than a given hash
target," I don't see anything that would stop a GPU programmer from
implementing bcrypt/scrypt on the CPU and parallelizing at the try-different-
nonces level.  
  
Maybe I'm missing something; I'm probably biased because I worked at SGI from
1988 to 1996 and saw first-hand the evolution of GPUs from very-special-
purpose chips with very limited memory to very-general-purpose vector-
processing pipelines with very fast access to lots of memory.
