Just to close the loop on this:  
  
This happened when:  
You ran version 0.3.17, and sent/received some coins  
You then ran an earlier version, and the coins you sent/received with 0.3.17
were rewriten to the wallet (e.g. you spent them or they got included in a
block). They'd get rewritten incorrectly (marked as version 0.3.17, but
missing extra info).  
... and then you upgraded to version 0.3.17 again. Bitcoin would crash trying
to read the extra, missing info.  
  
svn r196 fixes the problem, by storing the extra account info in a different
way and detecting the badly-written 0.3.17 entries.
