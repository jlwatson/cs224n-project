You're suggesting:  
ECDSA_SIGN(SHA256(RIPEMD160(SHA256(public_key))+"fixed string"+message))  
is more secure than:  
ECDSA_SIGN(SHA256("fixed string"+message))  
  
It sure looks more secure! But maybe some super-smart cryptographer will tease
out a relationship between all the hashing and signing in the first version
and it will turn out to be less secure; maybe she'll figure out a way to
factor out the private key if the public key is involved in the salt.  
  
I like the simpler version better.
