A couple of minor clarifications:  
  
There has always been an artificial block size limit; Satoshi's code
exponentially increased required transaction fees required to get into a block
as the block filled up from 250K to an absolute-maximum 500K. There are almost
certainly still miners running with that algorithm; their effective maximum
block size is a little more than 250K.  
  
Also, solo/p2p miners and pool operators running a recent version of bitcoind
can very easily change the maximum block size; it is a command-line /
bitcoin.conf setting. They don't need to use different software.
