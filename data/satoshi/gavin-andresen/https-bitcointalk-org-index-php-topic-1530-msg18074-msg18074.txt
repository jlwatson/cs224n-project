Dhaw generated all of these coins on his (her?) own machines.  
  
Unfortunately, either due to a bug or some oddness with Dhaw's network
connections they were all generated on an alternate block chain.  
  
The Bitcoin client really shouldn't allow coin generation until you have all
of the blocks up to the last block checkpoint.
