If you want to play that game, ETH price has gone x13.5 since I said that.

"Bitcoin becomes the Friendster of cryptocurrencies" is the risk.

Here's how I predict the heads-in-the-sand narrative will go over the next 5-10 years if Bitcoin continues to fail to scale:

"Yes, BTC is losing market share, but that's OK because it is still bigger than everybody else."

"Yes, BTC is no longer #1 in market cap, but that's OK because its price is highest."

"Yes, BTC no longer has highest price, but that's OK because its price is higher than it has ever been."

"Yes, BTC price is falling but that's OK because it has the most experienced developers who have been keeping the network secure the longest and they're working on Really Cool Stuff."

"OK, BTC is in a bit of a slump, but at least it is not the PayPal of cryptocurrency!"

Note that I said "If Bitcoin continues to fail to scale" and also note that I am not expressing an opinion on HOW it should scale (segwit, blocksize increase, or extension blocks).
