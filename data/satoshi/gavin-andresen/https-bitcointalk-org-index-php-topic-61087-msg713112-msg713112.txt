Ie, most bitcointalk people dont bother with reading the technical laden
Development & Technical Thread.  

  
I suppose I could have posted to the general Bitcoin Talk, but I didn't think
that kind of low-level "plumbing" would be of general interest, any more than
the average bitcoin user would care or notice a bunch of other low-level
"plumbing" changes that are being made (I've got a patch pending that a
certain-somebody doesn't like because it tightens up the definition of a
"standard" transaction; I expect that if I pull that patch he'll start
screaming that I'm wrecking future network flexibility all because I'm a big
old worry-wart).  
  
I **did** post to the Mining/Pools forum a couple of months ago looking for
feedback because miners/pool operators are the people who are "voting" on the
original proposal:
