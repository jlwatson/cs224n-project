It should be pretty easy to use the raw transactions API to implement a "send
all".  
  
You would do:  
listunspent --> list of inputs  
Then estimate a reasonable fee (this is the hardest bit, but listunspent tells
you amount and #confirmations and you can estimate tx size based on number of
inputs)  
createrawtransaction/signrawtransaction/sendrawtransaction  
  
Somebody should write a little python tool we can ship in contrib/
