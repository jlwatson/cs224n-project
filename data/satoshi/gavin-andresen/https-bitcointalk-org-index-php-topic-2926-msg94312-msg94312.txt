It seems we are far enough along to start using this process for releases and
maybe even nightlies. What do you need from me to make this a reality?  

  
I dunno, you tell me-- the idea is anybody can use gitian-builder to create
trusted releases, right? Working with BlueMatt to make the nightlies use it
seems like the right place to start.  
  
Mucking with the Linux build process isn't high on my own personal TODO list,
I have my hands busy wrestling with the Windows build (can gitian build
windows mingw bitcoin binaries?) and setup.nsi...
