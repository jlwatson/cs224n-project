For these and other reasons we already made the decision to go with SSL certs
for v1 despite their many problems. Later on, we can build either extensions
to the SSL PKI or entirely new parallel ones.  

  
What Mike said.  
  
Building a new PKI infrastructure is most definitely out of scope right now.  
  
But if somebody wants to spearhead an effort to get CAs to allow extra public
keys in the certificates that they issue... that might be worthwhile.  
  
Then again, maybe not-- DNSSEC/DANE might make the CAs obsolete.
