I am not a lawyer...

... but why would you get in trouble if you can:

A) Point to transactions in the Blockchain that show when you purchased the coins.

B) Show that you paid income taxes on the cash used for those purchases (e.g. cash was withdrawn from a bank account that your paycheck was deposited in to).

Just pay any capital gains taxes if you bought low and you should be fine, even if you are audited.

Unless the cash came from unreported income, in which case it might be worth the peace of mind to hire a tax attorney to file amended returns and pay back taxes and penalties.
