  
They can only invalidate transactions that they made (or further transactions
that spend transactions that they made). That makes the attack a lot less
likely in practice; if they had a lot of bitcoins, and purchased a lot of good
or services (or exchanged them for dollars or euros) with a lot of people,
then some of those people are likely to know WHO "they" are. And if they're in
the same legal jurisdiction, it seems to me you'd have a pretty good case for
suing them for fraud.  
  
Even if 'they' decided to do this just to try to mess up the bitcoin network
it might be messy for the exchanges to clean up but I don't think it would
cripple them. The bitcoin client already trys to select "old money" when it
creates transactions, so assuming that the exchange has a good cushion of
bitcoins on deposit all the attacker is likely to accomplish is to invalidate
their own deposits at the exchange.  
  
All that said: I'm not going to advise people to hold money they can't afford
to lose in bitcoins until the network has a lot more hashing power. There is
still some risk while bitcoin is young.
