The yoursway create-dmg script had the same problem.  
  
I changed the approach to using a "template" .dmg file, as described here:  
http://digital-sushi.org/entry/how-to-create-a-disk-image-installer-for-apple-
mac-os-x/  
  
The .dmg includes Bitcoin.app, a compiled bitcoind daemon, and the source code
.zipped up.
