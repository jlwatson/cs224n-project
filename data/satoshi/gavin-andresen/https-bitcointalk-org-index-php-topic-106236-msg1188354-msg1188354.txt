Release candidate 3 binaries are up; major differences from rc2 are:  
  
1) Fix the IPv6 RPC problem (you will get a warning in debug.log, that is
expected)  
2) Updated translations  
  
\------

with at least 3 gig of memory and 20 gig of disk space, you can now help
reproduce the builds using LXC running inside something like VirtualBox:
