There is no economic reason for a pool to reject any transaction w/ a 1
satoshi fee.  

  
Why do you assume that?  
  
A pool operator will have hardware capable of validating X transactions per
second. Right now, with low transaction volume, X is much bigger than current
transaction volume, no matter what kind of hardware the pool operator is
using.  
  
If we assume Bitcoin is successful, eventually the number of transactions to
be processed will be bigger than X.  
  
The pool operator will have an incentive to sort transactions by the fee minus
how expensive they are to process, and drop transactions that cost too much.
(or maybe implement some more complicated strategy like Mike's assurance
contracts-- I have no idea how it will evolve).

I wonder if it would be useful for miners to publish their transaction rules
somewhere?  

  
Miners have an incentive to lie about transaction fees to clients-- they want
higher fees, so even though they might accept 0.001BTC for a transaction they
might tell clients that the fee is 0.005BTC.  
  
Clients should be able to get a pretty good idea of what transaction fees are
needed (if any) to get a transaction into the block chain just by watching
'tx' and 'block' messages and seeing what miners are actually doing, instead
of trusting miners to tell the truth about what they are doing.
