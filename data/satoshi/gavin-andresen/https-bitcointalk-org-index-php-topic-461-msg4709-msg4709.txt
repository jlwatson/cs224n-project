I think there's no such thing a a "typical" settings file on Linux!  
  
I just did a quick survey of 20 .conf files in /etc on my debian system, and
found:  
1 file used "key value"  
5 used "key=value" (actually, a couple were "key = value", allowing whitespace
around the "=")  
14 did their own thing.  
  
The 14 that did their own thing were all over the map; from one-value-per-line
to "key:value" to full-blown XML. # is  
the universal comment character in the Linux world.  
  
My vote would be for:  
  
# comment  
key1=value1
