As I've been asking in other threads, but have yet to get an answer, I will
ask here again. Why is this such a rush? Why the secretive "upgrade?" What is
wrong with this proposal that it requires it to be force pushed through at
such a rapid pace?  
  
This needs to be weighed and measured and the potential consequences thought
out. Why is this not being done?  

  
I believe that without a deadline nothing would get done.  
  
We could talk and argue and discuss for six months trying to find the perfect
solution, and there would still be people saying that we need another six
months to argue and discuss some more.  
  
In fact, us developers HAVE been discussing and arguing about this for over
six months now; this whole thing started with an impromptu brainstorming
session at the first Bitcoin Conference in New York.  
  
As for this upgrade being "secretive" : huh? It certainly isn't/wasn't a
secret among the developers, and until the developers came to rough consensus
(and I believe there IS rough consensus, despite what Luke claims) I didn't
think non-developers would be interested in the technical details.  
  
From some of the reactions in this thread, I think I was right-- most people
don't care whether we use nails or screws or glue to build a better wallet.  
  
RE: rumors that I'm doing this for some personal reason: 100% untrue. I want a
solution because it will make Bitcoin better sooner.
