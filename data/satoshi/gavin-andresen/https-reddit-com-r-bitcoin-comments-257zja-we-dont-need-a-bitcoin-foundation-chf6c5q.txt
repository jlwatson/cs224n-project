You might not need a Foundation, but I certainly need a place to direct journalists and regulators when they come to me with questions. I also need the Foundation to jump through the hoops necessary to get Windows and OSX code signing certificates.

Complain all you like about the Foundation being centralized, but before the Foundation I was becoming the center of Bitcoin. That would have been even more centralized and dangerous.
