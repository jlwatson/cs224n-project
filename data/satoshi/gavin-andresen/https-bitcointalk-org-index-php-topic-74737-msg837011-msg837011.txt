This release is unstable as hell. I get crashes. I get unexpected exits. And I
get failures to restart.  

All righty... you're the first person I've heard that from.  
  
Please file bug reports on the github issue tracker. Include enough
information so we can reproduce the problem (what platform? what seems to
cause the problem? etc) and it might get fixed.  
  
I say "might" because if you're serving up a big mining pool running bitcoind
on Windows... well, none of the current core developers work on Windows.
