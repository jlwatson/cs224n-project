The problem is that there is a mismatch between the criteria used to accept a
transaction into the memory pool / relayed and the criteria most miners use to
choose transactions for their blocks.  
  
The fix is not conceptually hard; just modify the memory pool code so the
memory pool is treated like it is an extra-large block, and only relay/store
the transactions that are likely to be mined in the next few blocks.  
  
That hasn't been implemented yet because it just hasn't been a high priority.
