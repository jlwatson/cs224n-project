Because Foundation members posting on the forum may not want the entire world
to know that they are Foundation members with a quick Google search-- there is
a privacy issue.  
  
Somebody could sign up as a member and then try to screen-scrape and republish
everything somewhere, so members should assume that whatever they say will
eventually be public. And the membership might still decide that read-only for
non-members is the right thing to do-- I agree that it could be a good way to
attract new members, if the quality of conversation is high.
