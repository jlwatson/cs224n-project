Straight Bitcoin isn't designed for really small transactions. If you're
sending less than something like $1 worth of bitcoins, you should expect to
pay 10% or more in fees. More if you're trying to send $0.10 or less.  
  
There is no magic fairy wand we can wave and make Bitcoin suddenly great for
gazillions of tiny transactions; plan your businesses accordingly. As
transaction volume increases, there will be more competition for space in
blocks and fees are likely to rise.  
  
And please avoid filling your customer's wallets with "dust" that they'll pay
huge fees to spend; a payout should be at least a couple of cents, not a
fraction of a penny. I think there is pretty good consensus among the core
developers that sooner or later we'll make "dust" outputs non-standard, so
they are not relayed or mined by default (details to be worked out, we need to
implement a good algorithm for auto-adjusting the definition of "dust").
