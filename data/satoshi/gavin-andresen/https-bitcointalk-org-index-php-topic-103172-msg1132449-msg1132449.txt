That's wrong; you wouldn't be able to send a new-style transaction to a
merchant unless they'd already upgraded and were publishing new-style
addresses.  
  
... which would actually just be BIP16 addresses, with the redemption script
being something like <ed25519_pubkey> OP_NOP1  
(I'm wrong about needing a new bitcoin address type).  
  
Obviously merchants wouldn't start doing that until a majority of miners were
interpreting OP_NOP1 as OP_ED25519_VERIFY.
