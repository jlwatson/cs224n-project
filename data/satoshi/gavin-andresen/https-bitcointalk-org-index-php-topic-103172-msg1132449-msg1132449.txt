Redefining NOPs means that merchants who don't upgrade get effectively
downgraded to SPV level security (trust the chain strength) rather than full
verification because I could send them a transaction that spends anyone elses
money and they'd accept it. Or is that wrong?  

That's wrong; you wouldn't be able to send a new-style transaction to a
merchant unless they'd already upgraded and were publishing new-style
addresses.  
  
... which would actually just be BIP16 addresses, with the redemption script
being something like <ed25519_pubkey> OP_NOP1  
(I'm wrong about needing a new bitcoin address type).  
  
Obviously merchants wouldn't start doing that until a majority of miners were
interpreting OP_NOP1 as OP_ED25519_VERIFY.

I don't think now is the right time to do any of that, mostly because I
wouldn't be surprised if some solution for instant "off the chain" payments is
adopted instead, in which case perhaps sep256k1 transaction cost will be
negligible.  

What would such a solution look like?
