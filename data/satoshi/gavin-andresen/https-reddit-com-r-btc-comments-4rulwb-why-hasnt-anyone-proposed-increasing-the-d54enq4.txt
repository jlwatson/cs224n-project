You're probably right.

If that is the future, Bitcoin will survive, it will just be needlessly complicated and some people will lose money due to wallet implementation bugs.

Just like some people have lost money due to old wallets not implementing dynamic fee estimation.

But the wallet developers will get the blame, not the Core developers, so I guess that's OK?
