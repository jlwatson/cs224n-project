  
I'm allergic to that kind of bureaucracy. The agenda will probably be decided
ten minutes before the meeting, and will probably be something like "Peter
talks for ten minutes and answers questions for 20 minutes while everybody is
eating. Then we all talk to each other about whatever we like."  
  
One day maybe the Foundation will be big and bloated, and will have lots of
staff to prepare Official Agendas, solicit feedback from members months in
advance, tabulate the responses, then hire a consultant to figure out how to
increase the number of responses received, etc.  
  
I hope I'm not on the Board any more when that happens.
