I feel like we're talking past each other.  
  
You said: dev coin is a good model-- e.g. writer creates something, uses
devcoin, 90% goes to them, 10% to devcoin miner.  
  
I don't understand why a writer wouldn't just use dollars-- create something,
sell it for dollars, writer keeps 96%, PayPal gets 4% for processing the
transaction.  
  
Or Bitcoin: create something, sell it for Bitcoin, writer keeps 99% BitPay
gets 1% for processing the transaction (Bitcoin can do this because it is more
efficient than PayPal/credit card/traditional fiat, that is where the wealth
is created).  
  
Or is there some magical way that using an alt coin creates wealth out of thin
air? I don't see it....
