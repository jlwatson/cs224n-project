How did you build Berkeley DB? Something like this in the MSYS shell:  
sh ./dist/configure -enable-cxx -enable-mingw  
  
... should do the trick (see this thread, for example).  
  
I'm no longer develop on Windows, but I had to be very careful to make sure
bdb/boost/miniupnpc/openssl/Qt were all compiled with the same compiler and
compatible options (e.g. -arch i386 versus -arch x86_64) to successfully
compile bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt on my Mac.
