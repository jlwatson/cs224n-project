O(1) block propagation doesn't require a fork of any kind, it is just communication optimization.

It will almost certainly be implemented first as a separate peer-to-peer communication mechanism, with "gateway" nodes relaying blocks and transactions between the O(1) propagation network and the inefficient p2p network we have now.

At least, that is how I'm planning on implementing it, as soon as I'm sure there is a consensus on how to raise the block size (implementing O(1) block propagation will be a waste of time if we never have larger blocks).

(I don't think sidechains just for more transaction volume will work; I don't think they have a big enough advantage over completely centralized solutions like "Lets just clear all transactions through Coinbase and BitPay" to get adopted).


RE: your alt hardfork being painful: is there a post-mortem somewhere I can read to learn from what you done did?
