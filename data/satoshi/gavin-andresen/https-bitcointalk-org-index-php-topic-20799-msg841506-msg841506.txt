Don't worry, they don't have any chance to win

Personally, I consider the coin creation function (50 BTC every 10 minutes,
halving every 4 years) and rules for whether or not you can spend the coins
you have (if, and only if, you can satisfy the scriptPubKey by creating an
ECDSA signature then you can spend them) sacrosanct. Them's the rules of
Bitcoin, change them and it ain't Bitcoin any more.  
  
Extending Bitcoin to new and wonderful types of transactions is fine, and,
actually, I believe Therilith could build most of what he wants on top of
Bitcoin using pre-signed fee-only non-final transactions with a lockTime 10
years in the future.  
  
Convincing people to agree to do that would be another thing all together...
