I've wanted a libbitcoin since... well, since I first started browsing the
bitcoin source code.  
  
The consensus of the core bitcoin development team is to move towards a
libbitcoin in small-ish, incremental steps, NOT to move to a full-blown API in
one fell swoop.  
  
The Bitcoin Consultancy folks disagree with that approach, and are moving
ahead with a libbitcoin of their own that it rewritten from scratch, and I
suspect there will be at least two or three other alternative implementations
rewritten from scratch popping up over the next year or so. Which is why I'm
spending a lot of time thinking about and working on cross-implementation
testing.  
  
(I'm supposed to be on vacation here in Australia, but I'll try to find some
time to upload what I've done so far to github).
