  
Downgrading does not "fix" it. The earlier version would broadcast the
transaction, and then it would (most likely) either sit in the network with 0
confirmations for half a day or sit on your machine with 0 confirmations for a
few hours, until it aged enough to graduate from the 'very low priority'
category.  
  
The rule of thumb is 1 BTC you just received needs 144 confirmations (1 day)
before it is considered 'normal priority.' 10 bitcoins requires 1/10'th that--
15 confirmations would do it.  
  
Given the recent rise in bitcoin value, I think it makes sense to modify that
formula so 1 BTC takes (perhaps) 10 confirmations to be considered 'not likely
to be spam'.
