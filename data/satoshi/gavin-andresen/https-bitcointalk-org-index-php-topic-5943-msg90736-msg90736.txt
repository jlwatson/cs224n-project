Clearcoin requires 6 confirmations...  

Actually, Clearcoin only requires 3 confirmations.  
  
And now that I've got some pressing core bitcoin stuff off my plate, I'll get
back to working on a -testnet version of Clearcoin, and as soon as that is
done I'll be announcing a JSON-RPC API so you can write code that interacts
with clearcoin (creating escrows, getting their status, releasing coins if
you're properly authorized, etc).
