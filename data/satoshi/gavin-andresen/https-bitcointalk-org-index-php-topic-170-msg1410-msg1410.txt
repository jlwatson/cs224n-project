It took me a while to figure out where to get the wx_gtk2ud-2.9 library needed
to compile bitcoind, so I thought I'd share for anybody else who's not a
wxWidgets expert:  
  

Code:

If you want to build bitcoind, the no-gui bitcoin daemon, you need the
wxWidgets 'base' library.  
After untarring the wxWidgets source:  
  
cd /usr/local/wxWidgets-2.9.0  
mkdir buildbase  
cd buildbase  
../configure --disable-gui --enable-debug --disable-shared --enable-monolithic  
make  
sudo su  
make install  
ldconfig  

 ~~  
I'd humbly suggest adding the above to the build-unix.txt file... Satoshi, is
there a preferred way to submit patches?  
~~  
27 Aug 2010: This is no longer necessary-- bitcoind doesn't require wxwidgets
at all any more.
