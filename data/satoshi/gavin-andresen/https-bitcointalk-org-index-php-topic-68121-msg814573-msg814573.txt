  
That's source code for the kernel, right?  
  
I removed the old binary releases from SourceForge because it was getting
annoying to find things like testnet-in-a-box in that very long list, and also
getting hard to see what the latest release was. And with our gitian
reproducible build process, the windows/linux binaries for recent releases are
deterministically reproducible from the source code.  
  
See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags for the history back to the 0.1.5
release. Uploading 0.1 to github is a good idea, maybe somebody who knows more
about git than I do can suggest the best way to do that.
