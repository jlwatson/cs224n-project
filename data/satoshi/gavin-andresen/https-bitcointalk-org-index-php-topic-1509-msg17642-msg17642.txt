Bitcoin version 0.3.13.05 (svn revision 168) adds the -testnet option to
bitcoin/bitcoind, for testing or experimentation with worthless bitcoins on
the TEST payment network.  
  
This version is compatible with my old compile-time test network patch. Stuff
you aught to know as you run this:  
  

  * A -testnet bitcoin will use the same bitcoin.conf file as regular bitcoin (unless overridden with the -conf= switch).
  * The -testnet data directory is a "testnet" subdirectory in the regular data directory.
  * A -testnet bitcoin listens for connections on ports 8333/8332, just like regular bitcoin, so you _cannot_ run both -testnet and regular bitcoin at the same time on one machine.
  * You can get play bitcoins from the TEST faucet at https://freebitcoins.appspot.com/TEST/
  * testnet bitcoin addresses will not work on the regular bitcoin network, so it is impossible to accidently try to send real bitcoins to test address. However, regular bitcoin addresses _are_ valid testnet addresses; it is possible to try to send testnet bitcoins to a regular bitcoin address (they will effectively be lost if you do that).

  
This will be very useful for anybody creating a web-based bitcoin service. You
should be able to run bitcoind with the -testnet switch and no code changes to
test your service with pretend, instead of real, bitcoins.
