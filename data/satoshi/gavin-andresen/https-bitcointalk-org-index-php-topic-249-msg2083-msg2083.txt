In a thread in the Bitcoin Discussion forum, dwdollar says:  
I think it will be impossible to tell if a bubble&crash is "natural" or "the
men in black helicopters manipulating the system."  
  
Bitcoin will get mentioned someplace with lots of readers, a bunch of those
readers will like the idea and try to buy Bitcoins, their price will rise
which will draw even more people to "invest", which will drive the price up
even more... until people decide that the price isn't going to rise any more
and everybody rushes to sell before the price drops. I predict there will be
between one and five Bitcoin bubbles (price will double or more and then crash
back down below the starting price) in the next four years .  
  
What do you all think-- are bubbles and crashes a natural emergent property of
markets, or would Bitcoin be immune if nobody were **trying** to cause a
bubble?
