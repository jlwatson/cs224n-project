Very-low-priority transactions **will** get dropped by peers, because they
look like "spam" transactions and network bandwidth is not free.  
  
I don't know if the current rules are written down anywhere besides the source

my bitcoin improvement wish-list, so if they were written down they'd be
likely to change fairly soon...
