It looks like maybe some pools have reacted; the average block size is going
up:

For those that haven't, the relevant bitcoind command-line arguments are:  
  

Code:

-blockminsize=<n> Set minimum block size in bytes (default: 0)  
-blockmaxsize=<n> Set maximum block size in bytes (default: 250000)  
-blockprioritysize=<n> Set maximum size of high-priority/low-fee transactions in bytes (default: 27000)  
-mintxfee=<m.n> Minimum fee-per-kilobyte to qualify as fee-paying (default: 0.0001)  

  
Adding:  

Code:

blockmaxsize=500000  
blockprioritysize=45000  

... to your bitcoin.conf and re-starting bitcoind (or running with the
command-line arguments) will really help with the transaction crunch.  
  
I'm still hard at work (nearly done!) on making the reference implementation
much smarter about transaction fees, but until wallet software gets smarter
about fees we need to rely on big pools doing the right thing so Bitcoin users
don't get frustrated by long transaction confirmation times.
