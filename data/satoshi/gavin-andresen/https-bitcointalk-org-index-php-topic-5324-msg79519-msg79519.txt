Would it work if you used only two copies, one that always only mined, not
spending the money, and keeping the same address, and another that has that
address, that you use to spend and receive money as usual? Besides the lag
'til mining earnings show up on your spending wallet, is there gonna be any
issue?  

  
Better would be a new feature that tells the mining bitcoin "please credit
generated bitcoins to THIS address (instead of a new one)."  
  
If you are just mining, you don't need the private key at all, the bitcoin
address (or public key) is enough to create the coin generation transaction.
