Great idea!  
  
If implemented, it would probably make sense to create a little protocol for
the server and client to negotiate the amount of storage needed to "rent" a
connection slot. Maybe the server reports something like "I've got 0 slots
free, min/median/max proof-of-storage for my other connected nodes is
0/1MB/11MB."
