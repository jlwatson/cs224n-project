BIP 12 says: "If there are any OP_EVALs in the deserialized script they are
also executed, but recursion is limited to a depth of 2."  
I waffled on whether to propose any recursion at all, but I think just a touch
of recursion will be safe and very useful.  
  
And I wasn't clear, because I'm just thinking out loud: I meant take two big
256-bit random numbers (call them n1 and n2) and then produce three keypairs,
where the private keys are n1, n2, and n1*n2. Thinking a little further, a
2-of-2 with that key arrangement gives a kind of "a and b OR c" ... but if c
knows both n1 and n2 then the n1*n2 is redundant....  
  
Anyway, my point was that with some cleverness I think lots of things become
possible with just what is proposed with BIP 11, and I'd like to give people
time to explore what can be done and figure out how to make this stuff easy to
use before thinking about even more complicated transaction types.
