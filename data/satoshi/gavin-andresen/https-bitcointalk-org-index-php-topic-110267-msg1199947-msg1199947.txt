Yes, if by earlier you mean a few minutes earlier (it would have to have a 50+
BTC fee to make it worthwhile for miners to double-spend a transaction that
already made it into the last block).  
  
Two zero-confirmation transactions essentially happen at the same time as far
as the network is concerned; if there was a good way for everybody to agree
that they happened in a particular order we wouldn't need the blockchain. I
assume that miners will take the transactions that give them the greatest
short-term profit; that may not be correct (there might be a lot of miners
interested in the long-term health of Bitcoin), but I think it is the safest
assumption. And I think if we design payment protocols around that assumption
they will be more secure.
