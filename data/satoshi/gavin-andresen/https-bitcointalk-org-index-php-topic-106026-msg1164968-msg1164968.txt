Is a new type of message necessary?  
  
How about just making the transaction relay rules:  
  
1) If the transaction has inputs that conflict with one already in the best
blockchain, drop it.  
2) If the transaction has inputs that conflict with another transaction in the
memory pool, and it is the first such conflicting transaction, check the new
transaction's signatures and if they're OK mark the memory pool transaction as
"saw a double spend". Then relay the conflicting transaction (but don't
otherwise remember it).  
  
Rule (1) is to prevent an attacker from taking a bunch of her old, already-in-
the-blockchain outputs and trying to generate a "double spend alert storm" by
sending bogus double-spend attempts for them.  
  
Rule (2) is to limit the amount of network traffic / signature checks an
attacker can create to be twice what they can generate today (attackers can,
and do, try to flood the network with transactions, but transaction fees and
the free transaction relay policy keeps them in check).  
  
The GUI/RPC should definitely show attempted-double-spend memory pool (0-conf)
transactions as "BEWARE".  
  
I think those rules will flood the network with the double-spend attempt,
alerting merchants/users that something odd is happening. Without making it
possible for an attacker to get the network flooded with gazillions of double-
spend alert messages.
