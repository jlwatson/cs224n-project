Exactly.  
  
My priorities are:  
  
\+ Network Security  
\+ Network Scalability  
\+ Network Stability  
  
After those Big Three:  
  
\+ Wallet Security  
  
Usability of the reference implementation is not on my priority list. I
believe the vast majority of users will (if they aren't already) use bitcoin
via a web-based service or an app on their mobile phone.  
  
RE: the bitcoin.org homepage: I think replacing the links to Bitcoin-Qt on the
hompage with just a link to the clients page is a good idea. Somebody should
get the consensus to do that and submit a pull request.
