All righty, I hereby state:  
  
All money values in the bitcoin JSON-RPC interface Are and Shall Be treated as
Decimal, with 8 digits of precision after the decimal point.  
  
If you're writing a banking application in a language that doesn't support
Decimal types from JSON, then you should pack up your bags and go home.
