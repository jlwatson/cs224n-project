What I meant is I go and find an output on the chain that the un-upgraded
merchant will see as a NOP/always-valid. Then I send him a transaction that
connects to it and then a regular old-style output that uses the address the
merchant gave me. I find the merchants IP address (maybe the node is running
on the web server) and send them the transaction. They "verify" it and
discover the input script satisfies the output, which causes them to believe
that they received money.  

Right, that was one of the lessons learned from BIP16-- transactions redeeming
non-standard inputs aught to be treated as non-standard. And they are, as of
v0.6 (I think, I'm really good at forgetting when changes were introduced).  
  
If the merchant is using stock bitcoind, then the non-standard transaction
won't show up in their wallet until it appears in a block with 1 confirmation,
making the security downgrade non-existent (it becomes a variation on the
Finney attack).
