Right, that was one of the lessons learned from BIP16-- transactions redeeming
non-standard inputs aught to be treated as non-standard. And they are, as of
v0.6 (I think, I'm really good at forgetting when changes were introduced).  
  
If the merchant is using stock bitcoind, then the non-standard transaction
won't show up in their wallet until it appears in a block with 1 confirmation,
making the security downgrade non-existent (it becomes a variation on the
Finney attack).
