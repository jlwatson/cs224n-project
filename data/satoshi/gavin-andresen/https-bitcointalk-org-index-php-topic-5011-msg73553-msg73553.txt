So... I'm working on a patch to add < COINBASE_MATURITY-confirmation
generation transactions to standard listtransactions, and trying to figure out
the right way to handle immature generation transactions.  
  
Either:  
a) list them as 'generate' -- they'll just happen to have confirmations < 100
(100 is the COINBASE_MATURITY, although the GUI doesn't show them until
confirmations>= 120).  
  
b) list them as 'immature' -- a new transaction category.  
  
I'm leaning towards (b), because that way apps don't have to know that
COINBASE_MATURITY is 100, and it is easier to double-check that
listtransactions agrees with the getbalance API calls (immature coins are
never counted in balances, because they can't be spent until they mature).  
  
The only drawback I can think of is that adding a new transaction category
might confuse existing code.
