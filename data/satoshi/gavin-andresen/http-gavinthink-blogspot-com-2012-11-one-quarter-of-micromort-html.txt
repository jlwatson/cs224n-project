Belated thanks to Roger Browne who responded to my last blog post and pointed
out that there already **is** a standard unit of risk-- the micromort, which
measures a one-in-a-million probability of death.  
  
In the time it takes me to write this blog post, I've got something like a
quarter of a micromort risk of dying from all causes. The average person racks
up about 40 micromorts per day.  
  
That's a pretty good benchmark! My little brain can understand numbers like
one-quarter or 40.  
  
There a great list of relative risks for various things on the wikipedia page
for micromort. I've always wondered just how dangerous skydiving really is,
and it isn't as dangerous as I thought. My risk of dying if I ever decided to
jump out of an airplane (7 micromorts) would be about the same risk as sitting
on the couch and watching TV for 4 hours.  
  
Since I wrote my last blog post, we've had a hard frost, so my risk of dying
from an Eastern Equine Encephalitis-infected mosquito is now zero micromorts.  
  
I'm not sure what to think of the fact that while we were being warned about
mosquitos here in Massachusetts, dying from fungus-tainted steroid shots
manufactured here and administered by our doctors turned out to be a much
higher risk. How much higher? I dunno. But I would if health officials and
reporters started telling us how many micromorts of risk we're getting when we
go outside for an hour during mosquito season or get a tainted injection from
our doctor...
