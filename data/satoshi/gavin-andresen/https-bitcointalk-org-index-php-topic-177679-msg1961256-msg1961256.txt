What is the foundation's plan?  

  
Last quarter's plan: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/?p=99  
  
What is next: I dunno. Foundation board will be meeting all day before the
conference, and we'll all be talking to lots of people at the conference to
figure out what the priorities should be going forward.  
  
As for excluding certain voices: "okey dokey." I listen a lot harder to people
who are actually getting things done, and have learned to tune out trolls.
