In order to enable interoperability we need to have a sufficiently detailed
specification of the scripting language, how mathematically scriptSig
satisfies scriptPubKey and some commitment from Satoshi that he will "play
nicely" with such efforts.  

  
I think it is WAY too early to nail all that down; bugs in that code caused
changes just a few months ago.  
  
Just write the code, and when core bitcoin changes, be prepared to change your
code. For the specific case we're talking about, you don't need to know all
the possible ways scriptSig satisfies scriptPubKey-- you just need to reverse
engineer how the standard send-to-bitcoin-address works so you can sign your
own send-to-bitcoin-address transactions.
