My turn to be the newbie: Is there a high-level discussion of the economics of
NameCoin or DNS in general somewhere? What is the scare resource that needs to
have a price attached?  
  
My half-baked thoughts:  
  
Seems like domain names are not the scarce resource; CPU power available to
process transactions is the scarce resource. So it seems to me simply not
allowing any free transactions, allowing an arbitrary number of "new domain"
and "domain transfer" transactions with arbitrary fees attached, and allowing
the mining nodes to decide which transactions to accept into their blocks and
which to drop will create the "right" number of domain names at the "right"
price.  
  
Any individual, well-known domain name _is_ a scarce resource.
"google.namecoin" is worth more than "xblkje4klj21.namecoin"... but if I want
to get the google.namecoin domain name from google (or a domain squatter), and
google or the domain squatter is willing to keep paying the (minimal) NameCoin
renewal transaction fee, then I can just offer them cash or bitcoins (or
NameCoins) to transfer the domain to me.
