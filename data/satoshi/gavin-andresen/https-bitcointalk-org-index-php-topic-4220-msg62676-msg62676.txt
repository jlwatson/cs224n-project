You can't send messages with transactions.  
  
There was some discussion of adding another "standard" transaction type that
allowed you to add N bytes of arbitrary data. I think that is a good idea (I
think people would find all sorts of interesting uses for it), but there are
higher priority things on the development roadmap.
