I love you guys, and hope you're being wildly successful... but:  
  
Plugging in "Deposit $200, get $192" for a cash deposit and then finding out
I'll actually have to bring $204.95 or $201.58 because of an extra third-party
processing fee feels like bait-and-switch to me. Don't you know in advance how
much the payment processors will charge? Does it vary based on location or
something?
