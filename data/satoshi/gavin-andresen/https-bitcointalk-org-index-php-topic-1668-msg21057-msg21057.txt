With davidonpda's help, I did some testing myself today with Satoshi's latest
code changes (setting priority based on transaction age, bitcoin amounts in,
and total transaction size in bytes -- svn rev 176).  
  
It behaved as expected, putting larger, older transactions ahead of the
pennies being flooded into the network, so "normal" transactions will be
confirmed promptly even if somebody decides to be a jerk and floods the
network with transactions.
