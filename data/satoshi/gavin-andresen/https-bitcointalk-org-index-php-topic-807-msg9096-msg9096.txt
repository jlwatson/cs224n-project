What happens when we desire to return additional information, beyond tx-id?  
  
For the sake of future compatibility, it seems like the flag should present a
choice between returning (a) just the current 'sent', or (b) a JSON map
containing tx-id, and perhaps other things.  

A 'gettransaction tx_id' API call is on my short list.  
  
What do other folks think; should sendtoaddress .... true return just the
tx_id, and you have to make another API call to get details if you need them?  
Or should it return an Array?
