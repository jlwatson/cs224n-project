  
I think that is a good thought experiment: If you replaced all uses of SHA256
in Bitcoin with MD5, what attacks would be possible? (please check my work, I
am not an expert on hash collisions)  
  
Well, to generate a collision:  
  
Block hashing would be safe, for now; the block header that is hashed is only
80 bytes long, much less than the 128 bytes of wiggle room needed to find a
collision.  
  
I believe an attacker could easily produce two different non-standard
transactions that hashed to the same txid. That would be a disaster, they
could split the blockchain and/or double-spend by broadcasting one version of
the transaction to half the network and the other to the other half of the
network.  
  
To split the chain the attacker would mine a block containing the 'poison'
transaction hash, and then broadcast two versions of the same block,
containing the two different-but-same-hash transactions. Half the network
would think that block contains 't1', and half 't2'. Everything would be just
fine until the attacker spent the outputs of t1 and/or t2... then Bad Things
would happen.  
  
Double-hashing doesn't help at all: If HASH(t1) == HASH(t2) then
HASH(HASH(t1)) == HASH(HASH(t2))

I do agree with everybody who points out that SHA256 isn't close to being
broken. If it does ever start to get close, then I'm sure we could figure out
a backwards-compatible fixes and phase them in (something like "a block's
coinbase transaction must include a SHA3-based transaction merkle root",
create a new version of OP_CHECKSIG that used SHA3, roll out a new alert
system that used SHA3, etc).
