on the subject of QR codes, you could just print a separate code above each
item in the vending machine, then all a customer has to do is scan the code
and push 'confirm' and the machine will vend whenever it receives a payment on
the particular account.  
  
Of course this means if you ever change prices you need to re-print codes with
the correct payment value on it, but it does mean that no codes need to be
entered into the machine at all.  

  
I love that idea! Point your camera at the product, confirm payment, and
you're done.  
  
RE: changing prices: I wonder if you could make little QR-code-capable LCD or
e-ink displays cheap enough to put 20 of them in a vending machine.  
  
It'd also be a great opportunity for practical jokes, like making the machine
vend... oh, I dunno, NerdsTM along with their popcorn.
