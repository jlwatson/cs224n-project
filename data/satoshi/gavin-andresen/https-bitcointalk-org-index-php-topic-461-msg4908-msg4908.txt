I volunteered to implement this, and made good progress today. Satoshi: I
should have patches for you tomorrow.  
  
Done: teach Bitcoin to read settings from {BITCOIN_DIR}/bitcoin.conf file, and
added -conf=path_to_config_file.conf command-line option.  
Done: teach Bitcoin RPC to require HTTP Basic authentication, and reject
requests with the wrong username/password.  
  
TODO: teach Bitcoin command-line RPC to add the Authorization: header. You
won't have to give the username/password when controlling bitcoin from the
command line, it'll read them from the bitcoin.conf file and Do the Right
Thing.  
TODO: dialog box or debug.log warning if no rpc.user/rpc.password is set,
explaining how to set.  
TODO: limit password guessing attempts if the rpc.password is < 15 characters
long.  
TODO: update the JSON-RPC wiki page  
  
After all that is done and I've sent patches to Satoshi, I'm going to add a
couple more things to bitcoin.conf :  
  
port= # to set the listen port (override default 8333)  
rpc.port= # to set the JSON-RPC port (override default 8332)  
  
With the existing -datadir option, that'll make it easier for me to run
multiple bitcoins on one box.
