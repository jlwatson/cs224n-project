Extending Bitcoin to new and wonderful types of transactions is fine, and,
actually, I believe Therilith could build most of what he wants on top of
Bitcoin

I don't think you are interested in wonderful types of transactions, may be
even the opposite.  
Now the rules are more strict and inputs are being checked for being standard
too  
  
We had the chance to enable more opcodes inside P2SH, but it didn't
happened...  

Write up a proposal, start experimenting on testnet, recruit people to think
really hard about how whether or not what you're proposing could be abused to
compromise security or could make a denial-of-service attack easier...  
  
I'm against changes that _might_ make Bitcoin a tiny bit better, but if you've
got a well-thought-out proposal for how to make Bitcoin much better in some
way then I'll help you argue for it.
