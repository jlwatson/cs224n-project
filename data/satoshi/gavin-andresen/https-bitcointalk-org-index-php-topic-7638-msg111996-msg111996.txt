So, questions:  
* Do you think a continuous decrease of the block reward is better?  
* Is it worth breaking backward compatibility for?  

  
No and no, in my opinion.  
  
I think being able to explain the block reward as "starts at 50 every 10
minutes and is cut in half every 4 years" is a big advantage. I like simple--
"the simplest possible solution that will work" is a good engineering rule of
thumb.
