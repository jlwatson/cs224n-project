  
That's actually a very hard attack to successfully pull off; I file it under
"theoretically worrisome, but practically not a high priority."  
  
It is hard because:  
\+ targeting a particular node is hard. The long-running nodes that you
probably want to target (merchants or exchangers or e-wallet services, where
double-spending could get you a significant number of bitcoins) will already
have 50+ connections to legitimate nodes, and an addr.dat full of the
addresses/ports of legitimate nodes.  
  
\+ you have to feed the target a bogus version of the block chain. And you
won't be able to feed them new blocks very fast, because difficulty is so high
(unless you invest a ton of hashing power to generate bogus blocks... but
that's stupid, you're wasting money mining worthless blocks so you can try to
pull off a probably-low-value double-spend???). Anybody you target is going to
wonder why their transactions are taking so long to confirm and why their
block count is falling behind everybody else's.  
  
  
Putting a few addnode=... to connect to trusted nodes (with static IP
addresses) at startup in your bitcoin.conf is a good idea.  
  
For (3), detecting dramatic, statistically-nearly-impossible-normally changes
in the hashing rate is a better way to detect sybil attacks. That's on my
personal "it'd be nice to have" list (because, as I said, I don't think this
is a big threat).
