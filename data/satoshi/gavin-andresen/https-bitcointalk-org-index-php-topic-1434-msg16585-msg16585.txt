SVN rev 166 (bitcoin version 0.3.13.4) implements secure incoming SSL JSON-RPC
connections to bitcoind or bitcoin -server on Linux and OSX.  
  
I've created a wiki page with detailed instructions on how to configure
bitcoin.conf for SSL JSON-RPC connections.  
  
SSL support is enabled at compile time with the USE_SSL #define, and is not
enabled in the Windows makefiles because I'm told there are... issues...
compiling full OpenSSL libraries on Windows (core bitcoin uses the openssl
libcrypto library, this change requires the full libssl library).
