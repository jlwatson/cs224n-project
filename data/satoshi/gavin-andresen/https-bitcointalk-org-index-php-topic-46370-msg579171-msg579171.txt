Gavin, have you abandoned any effort to utilize Stefan's bitcoinjs/nodejs
stuff for this testing framework?  

  
I never started with bitcoinjs/nodejs, because I'm not a JavaScript programmer
(and I'm too busy to take the time to learn).  
  
It would be lovely if somebody who **is** a JavaScript programmer decided to
show me how easy it would be and took bitcoinjs/nodejs and created a really
nice cross-implementation testing framework with a bunch of test chains.  
  
RE: Mike's point that creating full-difficulty test chains is a pain in the
ass: I think that one-time pain is worthwhile, because I don't think we can
count on every bitcoin implementor making it easy to run their implementation
in a unit-test mode with super-low difficulty. And creating difficulty-1
blocks with a GPU is actually pretty darn quick...
