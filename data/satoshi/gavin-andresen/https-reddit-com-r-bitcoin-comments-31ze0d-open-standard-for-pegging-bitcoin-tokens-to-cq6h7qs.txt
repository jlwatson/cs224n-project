No, it is not possible.

Well, it is not possible unless you are the issuer of both the token and the national currency.

Here is why it is not possible:

Start with a token that is supposed to be pegged to $1 per token.

Lets say there's a huge demand for the token, so a trillion tokens are issued at $1 a piece.

Then, for whatever reason ("animal spirits" maybe), there is a huge demand for dollars instead of tokens. Who pays $1trillion to maintain the peg?


There are all sorts of complicated financial schemes involving futures contracts or derivatives that, in my humble opinion, just confuse the issue. The fundamental questions are: who is making money by issuing the tokens? And what are the risks of buying or holding the tokens?
