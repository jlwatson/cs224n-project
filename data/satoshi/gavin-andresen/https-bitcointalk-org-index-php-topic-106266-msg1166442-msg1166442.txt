First: I think it is extremely unlikely that somebody would spend a million
dollars on an attack that takes months to pull off, doesn't benefit the
attacker at all, is easy to fix, and that would be easy for the network to
recover from.  
  
Good idea, and easy to do.  
  
I've got a half-finished "user-defined checkpoint" patch in my personal git
tree, so users, merchants, and big mining pools can decide for themselves to
add checkpoints on-the-fly (via an 'addcheckpoint' RPC command) to protect
against this type of attack.
