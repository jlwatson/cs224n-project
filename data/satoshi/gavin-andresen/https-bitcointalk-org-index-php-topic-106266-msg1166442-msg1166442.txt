First: I think it is extremely unlikely that somebody would spend a million
dollars on an attack that takes months to pull off, doesn't benefit the
attacker at all, is easy to fix, and that would be easy for the network to
recover from.

The only way to recover from these attacks is by downloading a new version of
the client with a new checkpoint with a much higher block difficulty. I can't
think of any other possible patch. Maybe the interval between new releases  
during the transition from GPUs to ASICs could be decreased.  

Good idea, and easy to do.  
  
I've got a half-finished "user-defined checkpoint" patch in my personal git
tree, so users, merchants, and big mining pools can decide for themselves to
add checkpoints on-the-fly (via an 'addcheckpoint' RPC command) to protect
against this type of attack.
