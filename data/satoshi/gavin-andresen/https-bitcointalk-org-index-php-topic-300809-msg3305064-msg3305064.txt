"Impress with this protocol" ??  
  
My primary motivation for the payment protocol can be seen in this mock-up of
multi-signature transaction authorization:

I want much more secure wallets, but we can't get there unless the "who am I
paying" piece is authenticated.  
  
You should save the "Gavin is trying to impress evil institutional investors"
mud-slinging for when I get around to laying out the argument for increasing
the block size, because that would be closer to the truth.
