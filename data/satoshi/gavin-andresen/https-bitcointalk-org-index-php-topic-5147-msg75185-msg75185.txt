ClearCoin requires 3 confirmations before coins are available to be released;
the sender will see something like:

Received: 0 (20.00 still waiting for confirmation)  

... while they're in the process of being confirmed.  
  
I'll change the receiver's status page so it shows the amount awaiting
confirmation, too.
