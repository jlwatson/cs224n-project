Ruby (or your Ruby JSON-RPC library) isn't setting the Authorization: HTTP
header from the username:password in the URL.  
  
I don't know anything about Ruby, but Mr. Google might be able to shed some
light-- you need to either set the Authorization: header yourself to do the
HTTP Basic authentication (I seem to recall some Ruby code on the Wikipedia
page about HTTP Basic Authentication) or, in some languages/frameworks there's
a way of setting up a 'context' for HTTP connections so the authentication
happens properly.
