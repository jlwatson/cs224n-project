dumb question, but i when it comes to verfying the sig, i only know how to
place the sig file wiht the same name as the .zip on with .asc into the same
directory and right click to validate. What is this sha256 sum thing? And is
that somehow generated off of Gavin's key? What does it verify and how to i
run the check?  
  
OS X Snow Leopard with GPG Tools.  

1\. Make sure the SHA256SUMS.asc file hasn't been modified:  

Code:

$ gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc  
gpg: Signature made Mon Jun 25 10:57:21 2012 EDT using RSA key ID 1FC730C1  
gpg: Good signature from "Gavin Andresen (CODE SIGNING KEY)
<gavinandresen@gmail.com>"  

  
2\. See what file you SHOULD have downloaded:  

Code:

$ grep macosx.dmg SHA256SUMS.asc  
3de1490d1390e5a085b4bc2217430b3caadd203780a7bfe8751e8d1930f087cc
bitcoin-0.6.3-macosx.dmg  

  
3\. Make sure the file you downloaded is exactly the same:  

Code:

$ shasum -a 256 bitcoin-0.6.3-macosx.dmg  
3de1490d1390e5a085b4bc2217430b3caadd203780a7bfe8751e8d1930f087cc
bitcoin-0.6.3-macosx.dmg
