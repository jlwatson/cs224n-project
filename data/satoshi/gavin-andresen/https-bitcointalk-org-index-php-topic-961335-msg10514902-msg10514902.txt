I think it will depend on the release.  
  
Adoption of 0.10.0 is looking really good:
https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/dashboard/?days=90#user-agents  
... going from about 3% of nodes to 12% in just the last three days.  
  
Different versions existing on the network isn't a problem until there is some
incompatible change in either the consensus code (a hard fork) or the p2p
networking protocol (and even that doesn't have to be a problem if there are
"bridge" nodes that speak both versions of the protocol and relay
blocks/transactions across the incompatible networks).
