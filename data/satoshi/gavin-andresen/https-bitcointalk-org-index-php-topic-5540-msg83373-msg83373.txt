Don't you need computer/internet access to make use of Bitcoin? I'd say that
rules out a lot of people, especially in third-world countries.  

  
In 2009:

over 65 percent of the African population had access to mobile phone service,
with. 93 percent covered in North Africa and 60 percent in sub-Saharan Africa

All mobile phones will be internet-enabled in 10 years, and I think it is
pretty safe to assume that most people on the planet will have some access. It
won't surprise me if bitcoin first goes mainstream in an up-and-coming third-
world country or region.
