A committed individual or organization could easily aquire network storage in
the Petabytes. I think that would be more than enough to get a sizable
operation started.  

  
1 petabyte is 1015 bytes.  
  
There are 2160 possible BTC addresses, each of which is 160 bits == 20 bytes
long.  
  
So to store all of them you need 2160x20 bytes, which is
29,230,032,746,618,058,364,073,696,654,325,660 petabytes.
