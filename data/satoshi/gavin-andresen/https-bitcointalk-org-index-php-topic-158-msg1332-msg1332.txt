Seems like $ would be inviting confusion, since it's followed by numbers that
can look kind-of like a dollar amount:  
19vcWM6EEbQHVdN2W8NXv9ySgsPjbZ6gU3$64.20.45.38  
  
means send $64.20 to my bitcoin address ?  
  
Hyphen or underscore would be less confusing, but I think period would work
really nicely:  
  
19vcWM6EEbQHVdN2W8NXv9ySgsPjbZ6gU3.64.20.45.38  
19vcWM6EEbQHVdN2W8NXv9ySgsPjbZ6gU3.skypaint.com  
  
The advantage of that last one is it is a valid URL; if a user pasted that
into Firefox's URL bar or searched for it in Google the website owner could
display a helpful web page explaining how to pay.
