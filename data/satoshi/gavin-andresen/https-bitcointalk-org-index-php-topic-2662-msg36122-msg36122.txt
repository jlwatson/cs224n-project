  
Good idea. I vote for the new wiki as the right spot, with the Discussion
pages there as the place to bring up issues with the documentation/etc.  
  
I'll put a pointer to the new wiki at the beginning of my bitcointools
NOTES.txt.  
  
  
Do we need a separate forum specifically for network-related stuff? Seems to
me the Development forum here is the right place for those kinds of
discussions.
