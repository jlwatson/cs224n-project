I think it would be to a great advantage to everybody involved if we all
worked together rather than having this accomplished as a bunch of different
and separate efforts.  

  
Good idea. I vote for the new wiki as the right spot, with the Discussion
pages there as the place to bring up issues with the documentation/etc.  
  
I'll put a pointer to the new wiki at the beginning of my bitcointools
NOTES.txt.

More significantly, I would like to get a forum or some place where we as a
community can intelligently debate and discuss the internal workings of the
software and specifically do either a "cleanup" of the protocol or to
rationally make changes to the overall protocol that can be beneficial.  

  
Do we need a separate forum specifically for network-related stuff? Seems to
me the Development forum here is the right place for those kinds of
discussions.
