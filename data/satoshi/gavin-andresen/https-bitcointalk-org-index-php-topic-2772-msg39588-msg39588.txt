1\. Not to touch anything and make "a week of refactoring".  
  
I personally do not quite understand the code which is in one giant file
main.cpp. I twice tried to start watch it but fell asleep in the middle. Git
does not like this arrangement of the code too.  

  
Having spent a lot of time working with the existing code, I don't think
splitting the code into multiple files would make it much easier to work with.
The hard part is figuring out how everything fits together (for example "if I
have a CWalletTx, how do I get the CBlock that it is in (if any)?"). Just
rearranging the code that is there now won't make that problem any better.

2\. We're all bitcoin millionaires and billionaires (except of me, probably).
Maybe it's time to hire 1-2 employees? Or establish a reward for bugs busters?  

  
I don't think anybody who has worked on the code, except for Satoshi, has a
lot of bitcoins. I certainly don't. I hope to earn some with Clearcoin....

I am concerned about errors that prevent realize listtransatstions (
https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=2306.0 ). From a distance at least
one bug look quite dangerous:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/#issue/28  

  
The listaccounts bug is nearly fixed. I cannot reproduce the dangerous-looking
bug, even running bitcoind under the valgrind memory-checking tool (valgrind
actually simulates machine instructions to catch memory access errors)-- tcatm
seems to be the only person having the issue.
