  
Having spent a lot of time working with the existing code, I don't think
splitting the code into multiple files would make it much easier to work with.
The hard part is figuring out how everything fits together (for example "if I
have a CWalletTx, how do I get the CBlock that it is in (if any)?"). Just
rearranging the code that is there now won't make that problem any better.  
  
  
I don't think anybody who has worked on the code, except for Satoshi, has a
lot of bitcoins. I certainly don't. I hope to earn some with Clearcoin....  
  
  
The listaccounts bug is nearly fixed. I cannot reproduce the dangerous-looking
bug, even running bitcoind under the valgrind memory-checking tool (valgrind
actually simulates machine instructions to catch memory access errors)-- tcatm
seems to be the only person having the issue.
