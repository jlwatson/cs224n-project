  
Who gets to decide how slow is too slow?  
  
Mining these days requires investing in ASIC hardware. Solo mining or running
a pool will very soon require investing in a reasonably fast network
connection and a machine with at least a few gigabytes of memory.  
  
Knocking the slowest N% of solo miners/pools off the network every year (where
N is less than 20 or so) is not a crisis. That is the way free-market
competition works.
