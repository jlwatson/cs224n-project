I'm curious to hear what other people think. I shut down ClearCoin when the
value of its wallet threatened to get so large I was no longer comfortable
self-insuring it with my own personal bitcoins. It is still shut down because
I haven't found a group that I would trust to run it securely (and I don't
want to take the time to raise the money and hire experts to run it properly).  
  
We are starting to see well-capitalized, experienced companies creating
bitcoin businesses; at this point, I think if you are holding other people's
bitcoins then having insurance or posting a bond to self-insure up-to-some-
value for each account is reasonable.  
  
In my view, if your business model for your **free** service doesn't cover the
cost of insurance or a bond, then you're just pushing a lot of hidden risk
onto your users.
