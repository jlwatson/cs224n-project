Alternative algorithms for accepting deep block-chain re-orgs sound like a
research project to me. Before changing something that critical I would like
to see simulations of how different re-org policies behave under different
attack scenarios, and non-attack "what if there is a bug that causes an
inadvertent block chain split" scenarios.  
  
And I'd like to see a whitepaper that lays out the issues and summarizes
simulation results. And lots of extra credit if it gets peer-reviewed and
published in one of the IEEE or ACM journals.
