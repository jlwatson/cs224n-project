RE: moving to another hashing algorithm for bitcoin addresses:  
  
Did you read what Satoshi wrote?  
  
If you want to make money, you are far, far, far, far, far, far better off
using your hardware to generate blocks than trying to find a bitcoin address
collision and steal bitcoins. Potential address collisions are not a weakness,
and switching to another algorithm would be just busy-work for us developers
who should be spending time on REAL weaknesses (like figuring out how to make
bitcoin more secure against trojans and viruses).
