"you didn't offer a fee" is misleading; the bitcoin software 99+% of people
are using today doesn't let "you" very much flexibility in how you offer fees.
So basically, 99+% of people using bitcoin are charged fees based on a set of
built-in rules.  
  
If you want to send a fee with every transaction, you can run bitcoin with the
-paytxfee= option; there isn't much reason to do that now, unless you're
generating lots of very small (few-bitpenny) transactions. The Bitcoin Faucet
is running with -paytxfee=0.01 because it DOES generate lots of very small
transactions.
