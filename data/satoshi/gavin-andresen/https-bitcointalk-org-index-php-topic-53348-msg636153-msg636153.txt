longer timescale. When the dinosaurs were around CO2 concentrations were up
around 3000ppm.  
  
I'm not saying there will be no effects of global warming-- I am claiming that
we, and mother nature, will adapt.  
  
We could argue about whether it would be less expensive or better to change
our behavior now rather than just adapt later-- last I looked, adapting by
(for example) moving inland and abandoning low- lying cities and countries was
estimated to be cheaper than spending money to reduce CO2 emissions.
