Could someone make a graph of all the coin values ever awarded, their path
through the system, and their current holder? Something like
http://www.wheresgeorge.com/ but on the whole economy?

  
Every generated coin gets a unique address, so you until they get bundled
together and sent somewhere you don't know to whom ("whom" as in "which
Bitcoin Address") they belong.

Yes. You can get the "top 10 most valuable BitCoin addresses", but not the
"top 10 richest users"

  
You can get the top 10 addresses that have received the most coins (and could
figure out how many have gone back out), but there will probably be a lot of
generated coins that have never been spent which will just look like little
50-coin islands.

But could someone, conceivably, state with accuracy how much money has been
donated to Bitfountain's posted address?

  
Yes; the ~~BitFountain~~ ~~BitTap~~ BitFaucet donation address doesn't change,
so you can see how many bitcoins have gone in.
