  
Every generated coin gets a unique address, so you until they get bundled
together and sent somewhere you don't know to whom ("whom" as in "which
Bitcoin Address") they belong.  
  
  
You can get the top 10 addresses that have received the most coins (and could
figure out how many have gone back out), but there will probably be a lot of
generated coins that have never been spent which will just look like little
50-coin islands.  
  
  
Yes; the ~~BitFountain~~ ~~BitTap~~ BitFaucet donation address doesn't change,
so you can see how many bitcoins have gone in.
