Just tried testing 0.5.0 on Linux64.. Here's the result:  

  
I don't have a Linux64-with-GUI machine available to try to debug this, and
I've failed to reproduce it on an Ubuntu 10.10 'maverick' server.  
  
If you can, please test (and, if you can, help debug) on 64-bit Linux. This is
the last issue holding up the release.
