Personally I think an interim step would be a version which has IRC and an
option (enabled/disabled) and a "forget all addresses" option to experiment w/
non-IRC node discovery.  

You can remove the addr.dat file and run with the -noirc and -nodnsseed
options to experiment right now.  
  
I fixed the bootstrap-from-hard-coded seed node code a couple of months ago,
so use a recent version of bitcoin to see it working properly.
