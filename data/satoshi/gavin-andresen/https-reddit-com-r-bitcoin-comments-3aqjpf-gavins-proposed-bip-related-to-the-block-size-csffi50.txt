The sky will not fall if the block size stays at 1MB-- there will just be a lot of disgruntled users pissed off that their transactions don't confirm as fast as they expect and they have to pay more than they expect.

If the block size must be raised eventually (and basically everyone agrees it must be raised at some point) then I think it is best to do it now, when there is time for thorough testing and a careful, planned rollout. And before there are a lot of unhappy users telling their friends how their money got stuck in the Bitcoin network.
