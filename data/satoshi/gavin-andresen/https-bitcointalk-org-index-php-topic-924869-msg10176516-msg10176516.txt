  
Even in that case, the certificate is " **a** " weak link, not " **the** "
weak link. Think through what would have to fail to pull off a steal-bitcoins
attack in the multisig-wallet case:  
  
1) User has to be directed to an attacker-controlled payment website. That
means either DNS lookup is compromised or the user's connection to the
Internet is compromised (weak link number 1).  
  
2) Attacker serves up a signed PaymentRequest with a valid certificate signed
by a compromised root certificate authority (weak link number 2).  
  
  
If the attacker can accomplish (1), it is likely they would just serve up
unsigned payment requests from a non-secure website and bet that the user
doesn't notice the lack of a padlock in the web browser UI and agrees to pay
to an unauthenticated bitcoin address.  
  
 ~~(1) is mitigated if the payment website uses HSTS headers so any repeat
visitors get a HTTPS connection-- that pushes the attack to "must compromise
both the connection and be able to spoof the web server certificate".~~ Strike
that, if their computer is compromised HSTS headers won't help.  
  
In any case, I wouldn't say the root certificates are a single point of
failure.
