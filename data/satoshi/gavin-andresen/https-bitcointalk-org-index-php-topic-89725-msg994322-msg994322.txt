Thank you Devs, this is great!  
Is there some more information on this batch mode available? Would it also be
possible to request in one call information about many unrelated TXs (because
you mention "all transactions in a block"...)?  

  
See "Batch Mode" in the JSON 2.0 spec: http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification  
  
Yes, you can request information about many unrelated transactions in one
call.
