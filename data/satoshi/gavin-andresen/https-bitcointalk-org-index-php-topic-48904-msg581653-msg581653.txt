Amir started the "get more formal about changes to bitcoin" ball rolling by
creating BIP 0001, starting from the Python "PEP" / BitTorrent "BEP"
processes.  
  
The idea is to use BIPs for changes that may or will affect every bitcoin
implementation (not to use them for proposed changes to one particular
implementation).  
  
I'd like to propose some minor changes to the process:  
  

  * I propose that BIPs be wiki pages, with a social convention that the Author gets final word if any editing wars break out.
  * If he's willing, I propose that Amir take the role of BIP editor.
  * I think bitcoin is still too small to have a specialized "bitcoin-ideas" mailing list; I propose that new potential BIPs be discussed either here or on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.
