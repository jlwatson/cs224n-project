Not relaying "smelly" blocks is a very interesting idea.  
  
It doesn't have to be a binary relay/don't relay... you could immediately
relay good blocks but wait a while before relaying bad blocks, and make the
length of time you wait to relay based on how bad you think they are (maximum
of maybe 10 minutes before you relay).  
  
But... not relaying new blocks immediately might just encourage the bad guys
to try to connect directly to as many nodes as possible, and that could be bad
for network health.
