ByteCoin: cool! Are you finding alternative public keys for a given ECC
private key? (are there multiple public keys for a given private ECC key??? I
know very little about elliptic curve cryptography)  
  
And to all: I couldn't resist, I updated the patch so it can search for a
regular expression and so it starts a separate thread and doesn't monopolize
the RPC thread. My machine is busy looking for a bitcoin address that matches
'^1Gavin' right now.
