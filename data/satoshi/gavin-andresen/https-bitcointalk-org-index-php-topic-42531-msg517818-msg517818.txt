They won't lose any money to fees, because they won't broadcast their
transactions-to-self, they'll just include them in blocks that they create.  
  
  
So, evil miner does:  
  
Gets some myselfcoins.  
Creates transactions that pays themselves the myselfcoins, and pays BIG fees.  
Does NOT broadcast those transactions.  
... eventually mines a block that contains those transactions (they're a
miner, they can put whatever transactions they like in their blocks).  
  
Then does that again and again, re-using the same coins, getting richer and
richer from the FEES+10%
