genjix, you're the third person to run into this problem; I'm looking into it.  
  
I suspect the problem is running a later svn version and then running the same
wallet with an earlier svn version; the format of wallet transactions changed
recently to support the 'accounts' feature.  
  
Your bitcoins are still safe in the wallet (all the private keys are still in
there). Stay tuned...
