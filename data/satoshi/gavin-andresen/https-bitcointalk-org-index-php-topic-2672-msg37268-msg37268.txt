Browser is the most buggy program on typical PC! Without browser planted into
SElinux I do not want this functionality - from leaky browser site can read
the password from config file and steal the money. Such bugs are still
happening.  

  
CORS support doesn't change this.  
  
IF the browser has a bug that lets JavaScript code read the local filesystem,
THEN JavaScript code can get your rpc username/password from your bitcoin.conf
file.  
  
And IF the JavaScript code can do that, then it can send rpc commands to
bitcoind running on localhost (because, surprisingly, the same-origin policy
does NOT apply to localhost: urls-- we learned that lesson here six months or
so ago).  
  
That is all true right now, with the released bitcoin/bitcoind.
