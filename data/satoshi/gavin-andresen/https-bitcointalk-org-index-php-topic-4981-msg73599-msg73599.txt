If this backward incompatible change will have to be done one day, why not
make it only once (by setting an automatic adjustment rule), and why not
considering making it now, while it's still easy?  

  
Patches welcome.  
  
But be aware that any patch that is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks
will be rejected, and I can't think of a way to automatically adjust the block
size that wouldn't be vulnerable to some big, anti-social miner (think "jerk
with a botnet") deciding it would be fun to artificially drive up transaction
volume, drive up the block size, and create a few gigabytes of worthless
blocks we all get to download forevermore.  
  
When we get close to bumping into the block size limitation it will be _easy_
to convince a majority of the network to upgrade-- that's one problem that is
obvious and easy to fix.
