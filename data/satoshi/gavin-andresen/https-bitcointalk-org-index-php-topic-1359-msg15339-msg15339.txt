There's a built-in mechanism for ensuring that this is never a serious
problem: the more coins that are lost, the more valuable the remaining coins
become.  
  
And the more valuable something is, the more careful people are not to lose
it. So there's a nice feedback loop that should naturally limit the number of
coins lost.  
  
If Bitcoin becomes the world's stable reserve currency then one bitcoin might
end up being worth tens of thousands of dollars and we'll all get **much**
more serious about backing up our wallets and keeping them secure. Or, I think
more likely, most people will use a service that they trust to keep their
coins backed up and secure...
