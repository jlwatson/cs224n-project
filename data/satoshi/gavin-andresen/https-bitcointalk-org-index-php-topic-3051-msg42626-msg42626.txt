Difficulty on the -testnet is annoyingly high. I propose resetting the
-testnet with a new genesis block, and changing the -testnet rules for
difficulty adjustment as follows:  
  
1\. Adjust difficulty on the testnet every 126 blocks (1/16'th the regular net
adjustment).  
2\. Keep the "difficulty can adjust up at most *4", but remove the limit on
how quickly difficulty can adjust down. Minimal difficulty would remain the
same.  
  
Unless I hear howls of protest or better ideas, I'll generate a genesis block
and submit a pull request with the changes. I won't switch the -testnet faucet
to the new chain until we've got 0.3.20 release candidate builds out.
