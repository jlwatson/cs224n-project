0.3.20.1 -maxsendbuffer was too small for the initial block download-- you
were probably just unlucky and connected to a 0.3.20.1 node. Connect to
somebody running either 0.3.20.2 or an earlier release and you won't run into
that problem (does bitcoinj re-connect if disconnected during block download?)
