  
0.4.0 : Out real soon (0.4.0 release candidate 2 binaries are available on
sourceforge now)  
  
0.4.1 : I'd give about a 80% chance of happening (major bug or security
problem found in 0.4.0)  
0.4.2 : I'd give about a 20% chance of happening (major bug or security
problem found in 0.4.1)  
  
0.5.0 : Will be the Qt release.  
  
Beyond that... who knows?
