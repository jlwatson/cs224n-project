We all learn from our mistakes.  
  
Would you be willing to write an "informational BIP" describing how to do a
rollout right in the future?  
  
I'm terrible at that kind of "first we'll need to get buy-in from groups X, Y,
and Z by doing A, B, and C, then each of those groups will elect
representatives who will have three days to agree to a schedule, which will be
announced blah blah blah blah"
