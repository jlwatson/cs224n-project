I don't think it bodes ill at all. I think, in the future, if something like
this is handled properly as a roll out, things will go very well. This entire
thing was botched from the beginning as far as the rollout goes and then
quickly devolved into this mess.  

We all learn from our mistakes.  
  
Would you be willing to write an "informational BIP" describing how to do a
rollout right in the future?  
  
I'm terrible at that kind of "first we'll need to get buy-in from groups X, Y,
and Z by doing A, B, and C, then each of those groups will elect
representatives who will have three days to agree to a schedule, which will be
announced blah blah blah blah"
