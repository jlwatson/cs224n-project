  
More documentation is great, so yeah, if you want a formal spec, go for it.  
  
Here's a tricky question you can start with:  
  
Assume there is a fork consisting of max-block-size blocks. How deep a
fork/re-organization MUST a conforming implementation handle? 6 blocks? 1000
blocks? as-many-blocks-as-there-are-in-the-chain blocks?  
  
Does that imply that a confirming implementation MUST be running with a
certain amount of memory, or MUST a conforming implementation be able to
handle such a chain fork within a certain amount of time?  
  
.. and once you answer all that: what if the network consists entirely of non-
conforming implementations that take shortcuts and just assume that there will
never be a re-org more than X blocks deep?
