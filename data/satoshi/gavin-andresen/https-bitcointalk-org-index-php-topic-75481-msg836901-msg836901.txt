  
I think it is really important that the bitcoins involved in failed escrows
not be destroyed, but EVENTUALLY make their way back into the economy.  
  
So I'd really like to see network and client support for having both people
pre-sign and hold on to a transaction with a far-in-the-future lockTime (maybe
as a fee-only transaction).
