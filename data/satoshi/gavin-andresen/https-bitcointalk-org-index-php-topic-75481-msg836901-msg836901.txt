In all cases: the Bitcoin network is acting as an escrow service -- and it's
conditions are release are: "Wait for further instructions that are agreed
upon by any two of these three people."  
  
**BTW:** I'm not proposing that this is _the only_ way to escrow in the BTC
network. I _would_ like to see some kind of time-locked tx that prevents
laziness, and doesn't give one party too much power. But I don't know how it
can be done when tx-replacement isn't enabled on the network.  

  
I think it is really important that the bitcoins involved in failed escrows
not be destroyed, but EVENTUALLY make their way back into the economy.  
  
So I'd really like to see network and client support for having both people
pre-sign and hold on to a transaction with a far-in-the-future lockTime (maybe
as a fee-only transaction).
