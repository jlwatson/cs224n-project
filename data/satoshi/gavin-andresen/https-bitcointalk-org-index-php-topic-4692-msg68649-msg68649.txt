If more bitcoin adoption means bitcoin mining replaces actual, physical gold
and silver mining then that should be a net positive for the environment. Gold
mining is dirty, dangerous, and destructive; if bitcoins eventually become "a
better gold", then there will be less pressure to dig up virgin wilderness.  
  
Right now, bitcoin mining is inefficient, but natural economic forces will
make it become increasingly efficient. We've already seen that, with more
efficient GPU mining replacing CPU mining because you get more hashing for
less electricity.  
  
Eventually, I'm confident you'll see big commercial-scale bitcoin mining
operations in places where either electricity is clean and cheap to produce,
or where the waste heat from bitcoin production is put to productive use
(maybe we'll all have network-connected bitcoin-mining space heaters to warm
our offices in 10 years).  
  
Before then, we probably **will** see bitcoin production using cheap, dirty
electricity in poorer countries. If history is any guide, as that helps to
make those countries richer their citizens will demand better environmental
standards. Even if we all decided that is unacceptable, I don't see any way to
prevent it-- there's no way to tell if a bitcoin was generated using solar
panels in the Sahara or dirty coal in Pennsylvania.
