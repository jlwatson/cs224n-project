i don't think i have the most correct answer. i just think that security isn't
as hardened as it could be, and there is at least one area where it could be
relatively easily strengthened, and an open discussion would probably be
beneficial.  

You mean like:

or  
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=19080.80  
or

encrypted.html  
or

It has been a while since I wrote a "State of Bitcoin Development" update (too
busy...), but wallet security was my second priority, behind network
stability, the last time I did one. It is still right at the top of my
priority list.
