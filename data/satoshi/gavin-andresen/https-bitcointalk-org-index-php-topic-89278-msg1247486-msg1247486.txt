I thought the consensus was that the mining devices just need a little extra
software onboard to increment extranonce and recompute the merkle root.  
  
I don't know nuthin about hardware/firmware design, or the miner<->pool
communication protocols, but it seems to me that should be pretty easy to
accomplish (the device will need to know the full coinbase transaction, a
pointer to where the extranonce is in that transaction, and a list of
transaction hashes so it can recompute the merkle root).
