ANY block size increase proposal will have to deal with O(n^2) hashing-to-compute-signature-hashes costs.  The BIP101 code includes reasonable limits, which should eventually become a separate BIP (I want to work with the other devs, because that piece is independent of whatever block-size-increase scheme is used).

See: https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/commit/eaa1d911815a9cc20264f01b4bd0b874735ada2c  for details.
