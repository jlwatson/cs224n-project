  
Transactions do not have an input address.  
  
They have one or more inputs, which may or may not correspond to one or more
addresses.  
  
If you have a CScript, then you can call:  

Code:

bool ExtractDestination(const CScript& scriptPubKey, CTxDestination&
addressRet);  
bool ExtractDestinations(const CScript& scriptPubKey, txnouttype& typeRet,
std::vector<CTxDestination>& addressRet, int& nRequiredRet);
