From these premise I draw the conclusion that the amount of hashing power in
the system (premise #3) will directly correlate with the amount of
transactional feeÂ’s in the system (premise #1), and hence the security of the
system (premise #2).  

  
You're assuming that miners are completely distinct from the people who want
the network to be secure (users/merchants/exchanges/etc).  
  
That is a bad assumption. Nothing stops a merchant who wants more network
security from either subsidizing miners (maybe in exchange for a promise to
prioritize transactions to them) or mining themselves.  
  
This is already happening, not for reasons of security but for other reasons.
