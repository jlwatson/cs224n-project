Here's a very straightforward non-centralised solution:  
  
The domain name belongs to whoever has submitted the lowest (i.e. most
difficult-to-compute) hash for that name. Ownership changes if someone submits
a lower (i.e. better) hash, but in that case there is a 90-day delay to give
the original owner a chance to submit a better hash and keep ownership of
their domain name.  

That's a really great idea!  
  
I think that's a type of all-pay auction; I wonder what an economist who's an
expert on auctions would think....
