So... I start from "more transactions == more success"  
  
I strongly feel that we shouldn't aim for Bitcoin topping out as a "high power
money" system that can process only 7 transactions per second.  
  
I agree with Stephen Pair-- THAT would be a highly centralized system.  
  
Oh, sure, mining might be decentralized. But who cares if you either have to
be a gazillionaire to participate directly on the network as an ordinary
transaction-creating customer, or have to have your transactions processed via
some centralized, trusted, off-the-chain transaction processing service?  
  
So, as I've said before: we're running up against the artificial 250K block
size limit now, I would like to see what happens. There are lots of moving
pieces here, so I don't think ANYBODY really knows what will happen (maybe
miners will collectively decide to keep the block size low, so they get more
fees. Maybe they will max it out to force out miners on slow networks. Maybe
they will keep it small so their blocks relay through slow connections faster
(maybe there will be a significant fraction of mining power listening for new
blocks behind tor, but blasting out new blocks not via tor)).  
  
  
I think we should put users first. What do users want? They want low
transaction fees and fast confirmations. Lets design for that case, because
THE USERS are who ultimately give Bitcoin value.
