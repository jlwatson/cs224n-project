  
No, they can't. You just extend the taint-tracking through the newly minted
coins (e.g. if you try to "melt" 75 BTC with the 25 BTC reward, then the
resulting 100 BTC should be considered 75% tainted).  
  
RE: orphans: orphans happen naturally when two nodes on the network find
blocks at approximately the same time. Somebody should do a rigorous analysis
to determine what are the most important factors affecting orphan rates
(number of connections? quality of connections? bandwidth available to "blast
out" the new block? block size? Number of not-previously-seen transactions
included in the block?)
