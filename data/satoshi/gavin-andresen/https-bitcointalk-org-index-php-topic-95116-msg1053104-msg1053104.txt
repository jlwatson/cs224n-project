Wow, the price has been going up since BCX made this announcement. Talk about
falling flat on your face.  

That makes sense. If you think BCX will succeed and are immoral, then the way
to profit at the exchange's expense is transfer a lot of LTC in to an exchange
and sell them for BTC during the fork.  
  
If the attack is successful then the LTC deposit is rolled back and you can
sell them again. Assuming there is somebody still willing to buy them.  
  
In any case, lots of buying before the attack then lots of selling while the
fork is being created is the pattern I would expect to see. Of course, that is
the same pattern as a plain pump-and-dump scheme...
