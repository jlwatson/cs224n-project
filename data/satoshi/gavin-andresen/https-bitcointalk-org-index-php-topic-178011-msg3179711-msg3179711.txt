* Any way to tell someone has sent you a multi-sig transaction  

  
"Patches welcome."  
  
A watch-only wallet that has a bunch of public keys (and multisig groups of
public keys) is a good idea. But first you'd need multi-wallet support.  
  
There is a pull request that adds watch-only addresses, but I think that is
the wrong way to go. Mixing up fund that can be spent with funds that cannot
be spent (e.g. because they're a multisig escrow you want to watch) is a bad
idea, and as soon as we have hierarchical deterministic wallets we'll want
watch-only wallets that are derived from a master key (or a set of master keys
in the case of multisig) where the local bitcoind doesn't have the private
seed for the key.
