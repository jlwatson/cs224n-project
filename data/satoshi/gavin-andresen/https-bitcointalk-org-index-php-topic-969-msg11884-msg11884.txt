I just submitted a patch to Satoshi to make bitcoin follow the JSON RPC over
HTTP spec, and to use the standardized error codes from the JSON-RPC 1.1/2.0
specs.  
  
If you talk directly to bitcoin via JSON-RPC calls, you might need to change
your code to recognize the new HTTP status codes and the new format for the
'error' member of the JSON response. For example:  
  
BEFORE, send {"id":"123", "method": "nosuchmethod", "params": [] } , get
response:  

Code:

HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error  
...  
  
{"result":null,"error":"Method not found.","id":"123"}

AFTER:

Code:

HTTP/1.1 404  
...  
  
{"result":null,"error":{"code":-32601,"message":"Method not
found"},"id":"123"}  

  
I also removed the broken 'Batch' support, to simplify the code. I had JSON-
RPC-2.0 batch support working properly, but backed those changes out because
JSON-RPC 2.0 is way too cutting-edge for bitcoin to support right now (none of
the JSON-RPC glue libraries support it yet, and the spec is still changing a
bit).
