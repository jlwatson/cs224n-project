Thanks for all the ideas!  
  
First: I'm definitely going to drop from 5 BTC; I think I'll go all the way
down to 0.50 BTC (rather than do 1 or 2). Giving away a percentage of how much
the faucet has is an interesting idea, but I want it to be as simple as
possible.  
  
Second: I really don't want to make getting coins from the Faucet a whole
heavy-weight "register and check your email and yada yada yada."  
  
But I do like the idea of adding an extra hurdle for 'suspicious-looking'
behavior. So I'm leaning towards doing some fuzzy browser fingerprinting
combined with rate-limiting and, if you look suspicious or the fountain has
been giving away a larger-than-usual number of coins, require that you login
with your google account before getting any coins. No google account: no
coins.  
  
It is hard to create lots of google accounts; they're requiring either phone
or SMS account verification these days...
