i know a great way to get more donations to the faucet: allow donators to
leave a short piece of text. since the bitcoin faucet is such a popular url,
donators could leave a link to their website or company, acting as an
advertisement. public pilanthopy to new bitcoin users as a way to promote your
company/brand image...  

Neat idea-- I've been thinking about how to let people/companies sponsor the
Faucet.  
  
The next couple of things on my TODO list are getting the 0.3.21 bitcoin
release process started and an API for ClearCoin, but I might tackle Faucet
donations after those are done.
