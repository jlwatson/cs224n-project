Does anybody have experience with valgrind -helgrind or other automated tools
for finding potential deadlocks?  
  
Running it on bitcoind I'm getting a huge number of false positives...  
  
Should we just document every method that holds one or more locks? I'm worried
there are other possible deadlocks lurking.
