  
Huh? getmemorypool discussion is/was here:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=39088.0  
  
I'll just note that I'm damned if I do pull stuff that has some discussion
here (and no objections raised), but damned if I don't pull stuff that first
had no discussion, and then had a little discussion with some dissent.
