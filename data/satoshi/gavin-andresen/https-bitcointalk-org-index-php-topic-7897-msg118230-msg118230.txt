if we want acceptance, we therefore want numbers. massive numbers.
micropayments is not so much the issue - what about micro ** _loans_**?  
have you approached kiva (http://www.kiva.org/ )?  
has anybody?  

  
Neat idea! All sorts of chicken-and-egg hurdles to overcome (what good is a
bitcoin loan if there is nothing to spend the bitcoins on?), but microlending
bitcoins would be great. I'm spread a little thin at the moment, but if you
think a conversation with kiva right now might be worthwhile then go for it.
You don't need anybody's permission or advice to become the Bitcoin-Kiva
Liason Officer.
