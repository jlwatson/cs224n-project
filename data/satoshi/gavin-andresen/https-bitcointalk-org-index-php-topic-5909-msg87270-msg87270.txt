There are actually a few different ways to get a negative account balance.  
  
1\. As theymos said, the "" account is special, and can go negative if you use
sendtoaddress instead of sendfrom.  
  
2\. Other accounts can go negative if they receive coins on a bitcoin address,
you send those coins from that account, and then you use setaccount to re-
assign those received coins to some other account.  
  
3\. They can also go negative by the transaction fee amount if you sendfrom
the coins in an account and the send needs a transaction fee.  
  
Also as theymos says, you can never send more coins than are in your total
wallet. And it should ALWAYS be true that the sum of coins in all accounts
equals the number of coins you can send.
