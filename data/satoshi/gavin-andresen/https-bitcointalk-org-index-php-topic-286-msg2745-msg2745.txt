Making it easier for merchants to accept bitcoins, and users to pay using
them, aught to be priority number 1.  
  
There's a great talk by the CTO of Facebook available on Youtube, and I think
he gave the right advice on scaling:  
Don't worry much about it until just before it becomes a problem. Don't
overengineer, because you're likely to waste time doing something that turns
out to be irrelevant.  
  
I think Satoshi has done an amazingly fantastic job; over the last two days of
Bitcoin being "slashdotted" I haven't heard of ANY problems with Bitcoin
transactions getting lost, or of the network crashing due to the load, or any
problem at all with the core functionality.  
  
Yes, it's annoying to have to wait for the block chain to download (especially
with the Microsoft Security Essentials weirdness), and yes it would be nice if
all the pieces of Bitcoin functionality were already nicely separated and
ready to be rearranged and extended in all the ways we all want to rearrange
and extend it. But I've been poking at the Bitcoin code for over a month now,
and the more I learn the more impressed I become at the thought that's gone
into it.

"We reject: kings, presidents and voting.  
We believe in: rough consensus and running code." -- David D. Clark
