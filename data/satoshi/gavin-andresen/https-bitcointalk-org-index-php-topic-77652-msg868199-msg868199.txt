Let me try to further explain why I want this feature (and I really don't care
exactly what form or exactly which RPC command is modified to support it) - I
am wanting to use the blockchain as a "true" ledger for a specific address
(i.e. that can be publicly audited without having to try and chase up "change"
addresses and without using inputs from any other address).  
  
I am so far surprised that no-one seems to be interested in this (for things
such as Bitcoin100) and (if the feature actually does get added) will be
creating a "project management" package for the CIYAM software platform that
will integrate with bitcoind to work with such "non-anonymous" addresses.  

I have a -noprivacy patch that I use for the Faucet that accomplishes what you
want, sending any change back to the funding address.  
  
It isn't part of the core code because it doesn't play nicely with other
features (accounts and listtransactions, for example). See
