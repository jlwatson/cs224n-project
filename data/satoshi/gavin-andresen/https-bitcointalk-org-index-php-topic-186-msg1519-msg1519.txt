So basically, you're running Bitcoin on a VPS and using an HTTPS connection
from App Engine to signal it what to do? Why not just host the site on your
server?  

App Engine gives me:  
Free bandwidth and data storage (with the option to pay for what I use if I go
over a gigabyte)  
Built-in, already-configured-and-tweaked tools like memcache and BigTable  
An architecture where scaling up is built-in (App Engine will automagically
replicate my app and distribute it across Google's worldwide content
distribution network if it gets a lot of traffic)  
  
And all of that is administered by Google's sysadmins (who are WAY better at
that than I am).  
  
But mostly I did it as an experiment and because it was a technical challenge
and because lately I'm an App Engine fanboy. I would've been done a day
earlier if I'd run everything on the same server and wrote the front end in
PHP+MySQL.
