Wow, this snuck up on me...  
  
So I'm headed to Australia in a week. I'll be in Sydney for a few days;
anybody want to meet for lunch on the 9'th or 10'th?  
  
Then I'll be in Hobart for a couple of weeks, then near Cairns for a couple of
week beginning July 22'nd; send me an email if you're nearby.
