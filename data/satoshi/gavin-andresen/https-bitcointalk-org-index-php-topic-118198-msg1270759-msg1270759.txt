This isn't a patch or pull request. It is an architectural issue that requires
extensive changes.  

Right, and we don't accept "change the world" pull requests because the risks
of introducing a catastrophic bug outweigh the benefits, and rewriting
everything invalidates all of the careful code review that's been done over
the past few years.  
  
However, we ARE moving towards better architecture as different parts of the
code get worked on to support new features or improve scalability or fix bugs.
For an example of inversion-of-control done right, look for use of boost
signals and slots; for example:  

Code:

boost::signals2::signal<void (CWallet *wallet, const uint256 &hashTx,
ChangeType status)> NotifyTransactionChanged;
