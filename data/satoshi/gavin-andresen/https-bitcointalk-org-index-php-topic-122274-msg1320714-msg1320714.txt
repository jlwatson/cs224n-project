Needless to say, sending funds to the coin has no possible positive outcome
and only one possible negative outcome: it encourages them to take it off
display. So please don't do it.  

  
+1 : most organizations won't appreciate getting random bitcoin donations, it
is a headache for them to figure out how to handle them properly (and they
will get pretty grumpy if they spend a couple hundred dollars worth of staff
time to deal with less than that in bitcoin donations).
