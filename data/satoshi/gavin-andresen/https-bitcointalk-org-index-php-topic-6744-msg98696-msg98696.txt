  
I think there's a good chance (mmm... 65.3%) that within 4 years one or more
of the largest 1,000 US banks will support currency exchange to/from bitcoin
for their customers.  
  
Why would bitcoin be a threat to banks? They're really good at securely
handling currency; that's a valuable service, whether the currency is dollars
or euros or bitcoins.
