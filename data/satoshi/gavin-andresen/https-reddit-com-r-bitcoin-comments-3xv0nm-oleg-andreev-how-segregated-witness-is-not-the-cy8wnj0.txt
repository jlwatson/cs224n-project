You haven't been paying attention.

Lots of miners have optimized their orphan rates by mining an empty block on just the 80-byte block header, so block size is irrelevant.

That is not ideal, but it does little harm and it is a smart thing to do until a better solution like 'weak blocks' is implemented.
