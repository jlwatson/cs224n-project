I was never strongly against the BCF anyway. Just voiced some theoretical
concerns and reservations about how it could influence the evolution of the
Bitcoin solution. I cannot help but feel slightly vindicated at this point.  

  
Huh. What evidence do you have that the Foundation has been hurting the
evolution of Bitcoin?  
  
Because it seems to me things have been going gangbusters since the Foundation
was formed (with all the usual chaos and drama).  
  
Or, to be less polite to all the haters: we've all been working our asses off
(especially Peter), to make Bitcoin a success. What have you anonymous cowards
been doing besides spouting off about things you know NOTHING about?
