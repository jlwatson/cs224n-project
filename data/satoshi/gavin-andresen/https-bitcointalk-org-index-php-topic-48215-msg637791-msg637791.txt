I think the version on the bitcoin wiki ( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0011
) is a little more up-to-date, but you should check with genjix, he's the BIP-
meister.  
  
Pull request for BIPS 11 12 and 13 is here:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/669  
Unless I hear objections, I'll probably pull it tomorrow.
