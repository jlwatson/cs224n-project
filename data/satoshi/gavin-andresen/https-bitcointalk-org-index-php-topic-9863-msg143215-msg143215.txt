On the other hand, a stable testnet is somewhat important for people that want
to debug and test merchant sites.  
  
This time, it took me about two days to generate any coins on the testnet, the
coins the faucet sent me never arrived (and still, it insisted it had sent me
coins, I wasn't able to repeat it).  

  
For debugging your own sites, a testnet-in-a-box setup is nice and stable,
completely under your control, and has a good supply of mature coins to debug
with. See http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/testnet-in-a-
box/
