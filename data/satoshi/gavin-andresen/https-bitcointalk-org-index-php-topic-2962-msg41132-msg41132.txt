I have a very old wallet, created by the first version of bitcoin. Recently I
upgraded to a modern version. However, the wallet has no pool entries. I
thought the upgrade would create 100 keypool entries?  

  
It will create 100 keypool entries the first time you request a new address or
if you turn on coin generation (the mining threads each ask the keypool for an
address to create the coinbase transactions).  
  
I don't know what the story is with "wkey".
