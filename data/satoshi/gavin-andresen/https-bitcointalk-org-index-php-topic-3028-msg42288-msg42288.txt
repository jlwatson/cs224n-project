Can you back up and describe what problems your patches solve?  
  
Here are the problems I care about:  
  
\+ If a user receives 1.000001 bitcoins, there is currently no way to transfer
the entire amount somewhere else using either the GUI or the RPC.  
  
\+ If a user receives 1.000001 bitcoins, the GUI will tell them they have
1.00.  
  
I don't care about systems without a FPU-- are there any such systems that
bitcoin actually runs on?  
  
I don't care about BTC vs TBC.
