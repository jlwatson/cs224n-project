  
This was a release process bug; I re-built/signed/uploaded the OSX .dmg to fix
it (and updated the SHASUMS files).  
  
The warning is harmless, and no code was changed, so if you don't want to re-
download and install you don't have to.  
  
Thanks to lots of hard work from Luke Dashjr and Cory Fields we should
(fingers crossed!) have deterministic OSX builds working before the next
release, which will make this kind of error impossible.
