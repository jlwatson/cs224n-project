I can't help it; it seems like I always look at things a little sideways.  
  
Case in point: the petition to get the MPAA to give the movie "Bully" a PG-13
rating.  
  
The argument is:  

> Because of the R rating, most kids won’t get to see this film. No one under
17 will be allowed to see the movie, and the film won’t be allowed to be
screened in American middle schools or high schools.

My first thought is "Darn Right! Bullying is bad! Where do I sign?"  
  
But then I start to wonder: is that true? Does an R rating really mean it
won't be allowed to be shown in schools?  
  
Maybe the real problem is inflexible school policies that rely exclusively on
MPAA ratings instead of letting teachers decide whether or not their classes
are mature enough to hear the "f-word."  
  
So I sent an email to the Amherst schools administration and got a very
helpful response:  

> Teachers are asked to check in with their principals before showing a movie
that has not been shown in the past as part of a unit of study. You can go to
the arps website under school committee policy manual to read them.

And, indeed, the policy for Amherst Schools has nothing to do with MPAA
ratings. Bravo! I'm glad we don't have one-size-fits-all policies.  
  
Of course my third thought on all of this is:  I wonder if showing movies
about the bad effects of bullying is an effective way to decrease bullying. It
sure seems like it should, but without data from a controlled experiment, I
wouldn't bet that it does.
