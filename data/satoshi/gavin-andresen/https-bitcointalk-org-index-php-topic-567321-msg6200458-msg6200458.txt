transactions send via sendrawtransaction are always debited from the default
"" account. Raw transactions and accounts are not designed to work together,
use one or the other .  
  
And preferably not accounts: unless somebody steps up and volunteers to make
the accounts feature "industrial-strength" (scalable, integrates with whatever
back-end database your company is using to track user information, can be
robustly backed up, etc) it is very likely it will be deprecated and then
dropped.
