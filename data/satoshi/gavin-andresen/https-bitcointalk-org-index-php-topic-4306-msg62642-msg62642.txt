The Bitcoin Faucet ran out of coins this morning, so I took that as a sign
that I should make some changes that I've been meaning to make for a while.  
  
The big change is the Faucet now requires you to have a Google account (and
login with your Google Account) to get coins. With IPv6 starting to happen,
and people getting ever more creative in the ways they tried to get around the
"X bitcoin per unique IP address" rule, I decided to let Google catch people
trying to create lots of accounts.  
  
From what I remember, the cost of buying a google account is much higher than
the value of the coins I'm giving out (as opposed to the cost of hiring
somebody to solve captchas), so the only people working hard to create new
Google accounts to try to rip off the Faucet will likely be teenagers with way
too much time on their hands.  
  
One little change: Faucet pay-outs are now:  
0.11 BTC when balance > 500 BTC  
0.05 otherwise (same as before).  
  
And an invisible change that actually happened a few days ago: the Faucet pays
a 0.01 transaction fee every time it sends coins. That makes Faucet
transactions get into blocks quicker when there are lots of other free
transactions on the network, and leaves more room in blocks for free
transactions.
