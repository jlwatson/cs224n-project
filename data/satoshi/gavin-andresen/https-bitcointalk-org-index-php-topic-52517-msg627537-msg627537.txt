  
Mmm... perfect software...  
  
You notice how we aren't at Bitcoin version 1.0 yet? That the version is "0.5
BETA" ?  
  
If you NEED it to be perfect then you're going to be waiting forever, because
no software is ever perfect.  
  
The criteria for a new 0.something release is "Is there general agreement that
it is better than the last release."  
  
There is general agreement that the new GUI is better; the huge problem with
the old GUI is we have no wxWidgets GUI programmers willing to support the old
GUI. There are several people contributing patches to the new Qt GUI.  
  
I've said it before but I'll say it again: Bitcoin is still a high-risk, high-
potential-reward experiment, and you shouldn't invest time or money that you
can't afford to lose. We're working hard to make it better, but we're not
perfect.
