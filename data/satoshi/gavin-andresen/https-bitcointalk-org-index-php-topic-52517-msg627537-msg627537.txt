i will contact Gavin shortly, i suggest you do the same, don't tell him what
they did wrong... tell him why its important to do beta testing outside his
the dev team b4 releasing new versions... in all honesty i don't give a fuck
how long it take for the client to evolve i just NEED it to be perfect ever
time  

  
Mmm... perfect software...  
  
You notice how we aren't at Bitcoin version 1.0 yet? That the version is "0.5
BETA" ?  
  
If you NEED it to be perfect then you're going to be waiting forever, because
no software is ever perfect.  
  
The criteria for a new 0.something release is "Is there general agreement that
it is better than the last release."  
  
There is general agreement that the new GUI is better; the huge problem with
the old GUI is we have no wxWidgets GUI programmers willing to support the old
GUI. There are several people contributing patches to the new Qt GUI.  
  
I've said it before but I'll say it again: Bitcoin is still a high-risk, high-
potential-reward experiment, and you shouldn't invest time or money that you
can't afford to lose. We're working hard to make it better, but we're not
perfect.
