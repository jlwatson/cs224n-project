Run in a datacenter where a government crackdown is unlikely. Are you worried about a global ban from every government? If that happens, Bitcoin will doomed to be a niche thing anyway, and the max block size won't matter much.

Go lookup how much datacenter bandwidth costs have dropped in the last 20 years and report back; I'd do it but I'm feeling a little lazy.
