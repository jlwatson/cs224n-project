  
The latest version of bitcoin **does** try to avoid "sub-cent change" by
adding more inputs.  
  
If it can't avoid it (e.g. you have 32.29 in your wallet and you send
32.28999999), then the sub-cent change becomes a sub-cent transaction fee. It
isn't lost, the miner that includes the transaction will get it.
