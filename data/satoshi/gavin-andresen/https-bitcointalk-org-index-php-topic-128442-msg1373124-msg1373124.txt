Receipt has got a flaw. As a merchant I won't be sending receipts of funds
without any confirmations. FYI  

  
I would urge you to return a receipt with a memo that says:  
  
"your order will be shipped as soon as your payment has three confirmations."  
  
Explicitly telling your customers what they can expect to happen next is a
great feature of the proposal, I think.
