Neat idea!  
  
I don't like the economics of it, though.  
  
First, it reinforces the "if you started mining early you are rich only
because you were lucky enough to be early" idea. And a lot of people already
think that is unfair; give the early miners a current mining discount and
you're just "helping the rich get richer."  
  
Second, what stops an attacker from offering early miners $$$ for their
(already spent) coinbase private keys? If they have value because they give a
mining discount, then there WILL be a market for them. A wealthy attacker
could just buy up as many as they can find and then take over the network with
less hashing power...
