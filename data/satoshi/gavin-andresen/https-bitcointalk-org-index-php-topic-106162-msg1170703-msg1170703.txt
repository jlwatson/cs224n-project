That would violate his users' privacy; maybe I don't want you (or the rest of
the world) to know that I have a Gox account.  
  
You don't need accounts or registration, you just need a two-step process:  
  
1) User tells you their refund address  
2) You give the user a unique deposit address, and link the refund and deposit
addresses in your database.  
  
To avoid creating a gazillion deposit addresses or bothering the user to give
you a refund address every time, you might want to store the "user already got
a deposit address" flag in a session cookie. But if the user will remember the
deposit address then even that isn't necessary.
