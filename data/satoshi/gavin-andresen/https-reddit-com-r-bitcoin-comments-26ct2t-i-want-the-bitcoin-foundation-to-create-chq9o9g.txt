You mean like seed development of a more private wallet? Did that (Coinpunk)

Or maybe sponsor bitcoin.org so we get better developer docs? Done

Or pay three devs to work on Bitcoin core full time? Yup

Or handle hundreds of press inquiries per month, or figure out who has the real power in DC, or build a DoS-resistant website for members or fundraise and recruit and fill out all the necessary paperwork so all of the people doing all of the above don't end up in jail for failing to file their taxes?

I eagerly await the decentralized DAC that will replace the Foundation. But I predict I will wait in vain.
