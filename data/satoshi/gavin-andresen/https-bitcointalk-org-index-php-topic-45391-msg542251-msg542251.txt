He goes as far as claiming that "D0g....................." is stronger than
"PrXyc.N(n4k77#L!eVdAfp9" based simply on the length. That's preposterous !
The first password has 36 bits of entropy while the second has 150 bits,
assuming a cracker aware of the "technique". Presuming that you are smarter
than the attacker is the road to security hell.  

  
I've been wondering about that-- is it possible to write a password cracker
that generates all the lower-entropy passwords first?  
  
That's the kind of theoretical computer science problem that it seems like
should have an answer, or have a proof that it is equivalent to the halting
problem.
