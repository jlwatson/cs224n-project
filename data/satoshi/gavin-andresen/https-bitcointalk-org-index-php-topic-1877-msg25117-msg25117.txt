So... 8 years ago some bittorrent folks came up with the magnet: URI scheme.  
And yet I don't run across many magnet links as I browse the web.  
  
As I browse the web I run into exactly three URI schemes: http, https, and
mailto.  
  
I think a bitcoin mime type will be easier to implement and is likely to be
more successful.
