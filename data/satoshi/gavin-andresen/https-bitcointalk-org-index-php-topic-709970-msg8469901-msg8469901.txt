Edit: With respect to CryptoNote and Monero, I do see merit in the argument
that the fee penalty alone may not be enough to constrain blocksize; however
when combined with the difficulty increase requirement the picture changes. As
for the specifics of the Monero blockchain there are also other factors
including dust from mining pools that led to the early bloating, and we must
also keep in mind the CryptoNote and Monero also have built in privacy which
adds to the blocksize by its very nature.  

Yes, its complicatedÂ— but it's also concerning. The only altcoins that I'm
aware of which have diverged from the current Bitcoin behavior in this front,
and did so with the benefits of all the discussions we've had before being
available to them, have been suffering from crippling bloat.  

  
Glancing at block explorers for Monero and ByteCoin... I'm not seeing
crippling bloat right now. I see lots of very-few-transactions blocks.  
  
Glancing at recent release notes for ByteCoin, it looks like transactions were
not being prioritized by fee, which is a fundamental to getting a working fee
market.  
  
Have Monero and ByteCoin fixed the bloat problem, or did the transaction
spammers just get bored and go away?
