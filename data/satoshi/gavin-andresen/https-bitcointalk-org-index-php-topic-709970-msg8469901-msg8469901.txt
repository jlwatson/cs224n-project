  
Glancing at block explorers for Monero and ByteCoin... I'm not seeing
crippling bloat right now. I see lots of very-few-transactions blocks.  
  
Glancing at recent release notes for ByteCoin, it looks like transactions were
not being prioritized by fee, which is a fundamental to getting a working fee
market.  
  
Have Monero and ByteCoin fixed the bloat problem, or did the transaction
spammers just get bored and go away?
