I just checked in a minor bug fix / cleanup.  
  
The bug: boolean options/flags were being treated inconsistently. If you
specified -gen=0, that meant (and still means) "do not generate." But
specifying -testnet=0 did the opposite of what you might expect.  
  
Now all boolean flags behave the same way; for example:  
-gen : means generate  
-gen=1 (or gen=1 in bitcoin.conf): means generate  
-gen=0 (or gen=0 in bitcoin.conf): means do not generate  
  
... and if you don't specify the option at all, that means "don't."  
  
 **Check your bitcoin.conf file!** If you are using anything beside "0" and
"1" for boolean options, you need to change. I had:  
  

Code:

rpcssl=true # THIS IS WRONG!

  
... in one of my bitcoin.conf files. The correct syntax is rpcssl=1
