I'm happy to tweak the parameters. The code I'm writing regression tests for right now is:

* 8MB max block size  (chinese miners were unhappy with 20 for not-entirely-clear reasons)
* Earliest fork date 11 Jan 2016 (miners and others want sooner rather than later)
* Activation when 750 of last 1,000 blocks are up-version (version 0x20000004 to be compatible with sipa's new versioning bits scheme)
* 2 week 'grace period' after 75% threshold reached before first >1MB block allowed to be mined
* 8MB cap doubles every two years (so 16MB in 2018, etc:  unless there is a soft fork before then because 16MB is too much)

The code for all that is starting to get right on the edge of "too complicated for consensus," but the individual pieces are all straightforward. I'll write a BIP when I'm done with the code, and, as I've said repeatedly, I'm not stuck to any particular set of parameters.
