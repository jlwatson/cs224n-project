hazek, you're really annoying me.  
  
First, you edited my OP and broke all of the links changing .org to .com.  
Then you sent me a PM asking if it would be ok to move this thread to Service
Discussion. WTF? If discussion of the Foundation isn't a good topic for the
main Discussion forum what is?  
  
Now you spout off about 'Gavin this, Gavin that.'  
  
It isn't easy to piss me off, but, I'm sorry, you're really pissing me off.
Bounties? Really? Point me to a successful security-critical open source
project where bounties pay the rent.  
  
I haven't tried kickstarter-like fundraising?
http://blockchain.info/address/17XvU95PkpDqXAr8ieNpYzSdRDRJL55UQ8 is the
address for the Bitcoin Testing Project, which has received a grand total of
72 BTC, which isn't nearly enough to pay a QA grunt, let alone a QA lead.  
  
You say "why change, Bitcoin has been working great for me!"  
  
It hasn't been working great for me; I'm frustrated by the lack of resources
and all of the distractions I have to deal with as the unelected, un-asked-for
de-facto leader of this amazing experiment. I'm excited about the Foundation,
because it is bringing together dedicated, effective people who **all want
Bitcoin to succeed.**
