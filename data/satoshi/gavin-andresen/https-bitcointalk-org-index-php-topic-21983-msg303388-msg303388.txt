One of the speakers at the Emerging Technology conference I attended at the
CIA was from Facebook Payments, and he seemed pretty adamant that they're
committed to doing what they can to keep the people buy the credits (users who
want to play games) separate from the people who cash them out (the game
developers).  
  
So a facebook app implementation of bitcoinjs would very likely not be
approved for Facebook payments.
