I figure each bitcoin transaction is currently costing about $US 0.0003
(three-hundredths of a cent)  
  
Here's the back-of-the-envelope calculation I used to get to that number:  
  
Transaction size: ~300 bytes.  
Disk space cost: 0.05 $US per gigabyte (about $100 for a 2TB hard drive these
days)  
Bandwidth cost: 0.02 $US per gigabyte  
CPU cost: 0 (bad assumption-- anybody want to try to come up with a better
estimate?)  
  
Size of bitcoin network: ~10,000 nodes  
  
Each transaction is currently sent across the network twice (once on its own,
and once when it becomes part of a block). It is stored on disk once. So
disk+bandwidth cost for one machine is:  
(0.05+0.02+0.02)*(300/1000000000)  
... times 10,000 nodes gives $0.00027 per transaction.  
  
  
Please check my work-- I usually screw up and add or drop an extra zero when
doing these types of calculations.
