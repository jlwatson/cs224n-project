A few things make those 31.42BTC transactions unique:  
  
\+ The timestamps in them will be different.  
\+ The input transactions will be different (you can think of those as being
different 'coins' going in to make the payment).  
\+ And if the input transactions don't add up to exactly 31.42 (and they
probably won't), they'll have different output transactions for returning any
change to Alice.  
  
By the way: all that stuff is hashed together to give each transaction a
unique 256-bit transaction ID (which you never see, but is used internally so
Bitcoin can quickly figure out if it has already seen this transaction
before).
