You should be using getreceivedbyaddress rather than getreceivedbyaccount. You
didn't assign that address to any account.  

  
What theymos said. You're asking for the balance of the _account_ named
'1Fs5rqB2sXZ3kax1r3HfuYpK2ksSxLYJT8', and there is no such account.  
  
Whether bitcoin should return an error (instead of 0) if you ask for the
balance of a non-existant account is debatable...
