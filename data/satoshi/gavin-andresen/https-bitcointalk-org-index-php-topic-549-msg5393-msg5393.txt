If a philanthropist wants to give away bitcoins to the bitcoin community, I'd
be happy to reset the Bitcoin Faucet rules to whatever the philanthropist
would like.  
  
Could be: donate 10,000 Bitcoins and then have the Faucet distribute 10 per IP
address (regardless of whether or not they got coins from the Faucet before)
until they're gone.
