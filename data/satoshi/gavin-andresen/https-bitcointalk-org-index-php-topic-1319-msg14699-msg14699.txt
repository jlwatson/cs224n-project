This patch adds the following JSON-RPC commands to bitcoin/bitcoind:  
  

  *  **monitoraddress <bitcoinaddress> <url> [monitor=true]**  
When coins are sent to <bitcoinaddress> POST JSON transaction info to <url>.  
If <bitcoinaddress> is 'allwallet' then monitor coins sent to all of your
addresses.  
Pass false as third param to stop monitoring.

  *  **monitorblocks <url> [monitor=true] [startblockcount=0]**  
POST block information to <url> as blocks are added to the block chain.  
[monitor] true will start monitoring, false will stop.  
Pass [startblockcount] to start monitoring at/after block with given
blockcount.

  *  **listmonitored**  
Returns list describing where blocks and transactions are being POSTed.

  *  **getblock <hash|number>**  
Returns details of the block with <hash> (hexadecimal) or <number>.

  *  **gettransaction <hash>**  
Returns details of transaction with <hash> (hexadecimal).

This patch also modifies the "sendtoaddress" function so it returns the
transaction ID on a successful send (instead of the string "sent").  
  
 **If you use the monitor* functionality** to POST information be sure to
think through the security of your application. For example, if you use
monitoraddress to get notified of customer payments you should think about
whether or not a customer could fake a payment by POSTing bogus information to
your web server.

As always, bug reports, suggestions for improvement and feedback is welcome.
