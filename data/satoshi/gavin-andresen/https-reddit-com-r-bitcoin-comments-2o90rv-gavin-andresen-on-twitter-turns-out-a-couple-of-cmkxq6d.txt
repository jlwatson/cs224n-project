It turns out the most profitable strategy for miners is to solo mine or mine in a pool with a trusted group of people some of the time, but the rest of the time participate anonymously in a big, anybody-is-allowed-to-join pool -- but withhold "winning shares" (when you get lucky and solve a block for the pool).

The reason that is the most profitable strategy is because you still get paid for all the non-winning shares, and since the big mining pool solves fewer blocks, difficulty does not rise as much so you make more money with your solo mining (or trusted pool), too.

Ittay argues this will be positive for Bitcoin-- it will make pools get smaller as big solo miners decide they will mine on their own instead of joining a pool that might be suffering from a withholding attack.
