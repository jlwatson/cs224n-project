Yes, I think that would be really good so each dev doesn't have to figure it
out themselves. We need a simple example for each of Python, PHP and Java
importing the json-rpc library and using it to do a getinfo or something,
including doing the http authentication part.  

OK, I did Python and PHP, and I added what I know about Java. Can somebody who
has used Java JSON-RPC update the wiki page with a working example?
