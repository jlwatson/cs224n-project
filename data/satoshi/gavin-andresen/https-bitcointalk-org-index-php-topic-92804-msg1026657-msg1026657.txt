RE: 101 or 103 unused keys in the keypool: That's normal. Here's the sequence
of events that causes it:  
  
\+ You do something that requests a new key from the keypool. Several things
do that (including the 'getinfo' RPC call -- it requests a key from the
keypool so it can report the keypoololdest time).  
\+ The keypool automatically adds new keys so there are always at least 100
(by default)  
\+ The something you did returns the key back to the keypool, so now there are
100+1  
  
I tend to have 104 keys in my keypools, because I do a lot of 4-core CPU
mining on testnet-in-a-box setups, and the 4 miner threads each grab a keypool
key that is released when bitcoind quits.  
  
RE: better backup: good idea. However, the keypool might not survive for much
longer; they're likely to be replaced by Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets
(see https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032 ).
