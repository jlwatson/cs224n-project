The best way to understand reference implementation accounts is to think of
bitcoins like real, physical coins.  
  
Like how a bank works:  
  
When you deposit coins in your account, they are credited to your account. And
then mixed in with all the other coins the bank gets.  
When you withdraw, you get coins from the Big Old Pool of Coins-- not the
coins you put in, necessarily.  
  
That said: general consensus among core devs is that the accounts feature
should go away. It is not appropriate for "enterprise-scale" multi-user use
(never optimized for that case, doesn't do ACID transactions with whatever
back-end database you're using for customer information, etc etc etc).  
  
And it doesn't do what most people seem to WANT it to do (act as multiple
wallets, keeping coins separate).
