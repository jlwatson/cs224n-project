I guess I'm having problems seeing where this algorithm is necessarily all
that difficult and can't be sped up in some manner where a dedicated coin
generator wouldn't have a huge advantage over a normal ordinary client in
terms of the creation of Bitcoins.  

  
Sure, you could build specialized hardware that computed SHA256 hashes faster
than ANYBODY!  
And then you'd be able to generate most of the bitcoins.  
  
So: how much would it cost you, in dollars or euros-- and don't forget to pay
yourself for the time needed to design and build such a system?  
  
Because you'd be able to generate, at most, 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes or
so. Soon after you started generating, all the other nodes on the network
notice that bitcoins are being generated quicker than normal and increase the
difficulty of the problem being solved (you've gotta twiddle the block header
more times to find SHA256Hash(block_header) < target_value ).  
  
If Bitcoins become even more wildly popular, then maybe people will think they
can profit by building or renting specialized hardware. That would be a very
good problem for Bitcoin to have.
