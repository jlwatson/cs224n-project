In a market based society there is only relative wealth. Bill Gate is not rich
because he has 40 billion dollars. He is rich because we all don't have 40
billion dollars. If we did all did the "average" house would cost 100 billion
dollars and we'd all still have mortgages.  

Hah! While I was typing this, Kiba said essentially the same thing...  
  
We are all rich because we have computers and the Internet and Wikipedia and
other wonders the world has never seen before.  
  
There **is** absolute wealth. We are healthier and wealthier and live longer
than any previous generation, and that's a wonderful thing.
