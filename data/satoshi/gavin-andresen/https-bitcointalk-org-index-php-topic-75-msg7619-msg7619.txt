Hah! While I was typing this, Kiba said essentially the same thing...  
  
We are all rich because we have computers and the Internet and Wikipedia and
other wonders the world has never seen before.  
  
There **is** absolute wealth. We are healthier and wealthier and live longer
than any previous generation, and that's a wonderful thing.
