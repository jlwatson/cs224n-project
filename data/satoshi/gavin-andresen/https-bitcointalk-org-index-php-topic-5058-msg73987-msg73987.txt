eideteker: Can you ask the skeptics what we, the Bitcoin Community, could do
to be less "smelly" or "sketchy" ?  
  
I find people are much more sympathetic if instead of saying "What's your
problem?" you instead ask "What am I doing wrong, and how can I fix it?"  
  
And then you can get all jujitsu on them and praise their great ideas and
gently suggest that you'd only screw up whatever it is they are suggesting
(and you're busy doing other stuff already) so maybe they should just go ahead
and do it...
