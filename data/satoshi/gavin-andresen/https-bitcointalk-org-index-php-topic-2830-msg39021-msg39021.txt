As the owner of the Faucet, and having seen how far some people will go to get
more than their fair share of bit-pennies from the Faucet, I've thought about
this subject.  
  
My conclusion is that instead of creating tools to try to become "the Bitcoin
Police", there are probably better things you can do with your time. Because
as soon as you create the tools, the bad guys will find ways to work around
them.
