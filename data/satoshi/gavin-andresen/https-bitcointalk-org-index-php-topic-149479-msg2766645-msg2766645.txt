I spent a bunch of time getting the mingw-cross-compiled Qt compiled with
-openssl-linked for the payment protocol work (it uses QtNetwork to fetch
PaymentRequest/PaymentACK messages via https).  
  
The magic configure incantation was:  
  
Nothing special needed to be done for the openssl build:  
  
  
  
The payment protocol code add a couple more depedencies to Bitcoin-Qt:  
  
\+ QtNetwork with OpenSSL support  
\+ Google's protocol buffer library and compiler.
