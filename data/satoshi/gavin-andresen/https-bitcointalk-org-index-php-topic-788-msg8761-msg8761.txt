Bitcoin's p2p network is subject to various kinds of denial of service
attacks.  
  
There, I said it.  
  
Do you have constructive suggestions for how to fix it, or are you the kind of
person who just enjoys breaking things because you can?  
  
Ideas that have been bouncing around my head that may or may not work:  
  
\+ have clients tell each other how many transactions per unit of time they're
willing to accept. If a client sends you more (within some fuzz factor), drop
it. Compile in a default that's based on estimated number of transactions for
a typical user and estimate on the number of current users.  
  
\+ require some proof-of-work as part of the client-to-client connection
process (helps prevent 'Sybil' attacks).
