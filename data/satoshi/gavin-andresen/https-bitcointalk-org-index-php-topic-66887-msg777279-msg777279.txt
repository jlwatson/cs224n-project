Windows, Linux and Mac binaries for 0.6rc2 are up at:  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.6.0/test/  
  
Please use github to report bugs:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues  
  
Note that there were a few "release candidate 1 doesn't work on Windows" bug
reports that, as far as I know, have not been fixed. We need some good Qt-on-
Windows developers to help out, none of the current core developers use
Windows as our primary development platform.  
  
A lot of bug-fixing happened between release candidate 1 and release candidate
2, but we did also sneak in one major new feature that was long overdue: a
Backup Wallet menu entry.  
  
 **Be aware:** the 0.6 release will create wallet.dat files that will not work
with older releases, so you should back-up your wallet before running in case
you need to revert back to an older release. 0.6 doesn't mark the wallet as
backwards-incompatible until a new 'compressed' keypool key is added, so until
you do something that generates a new key the wallet will stay compatible.
Compressed keys will benefit everybody by using less network bandwidth,
allowing more transactions to fit into each block, and making the blockchain
smaller than it would otherwise be.  
  
Even a little time testing helps a lot; if you do can do some testing please
reply in this thread with a message like "Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind both worked
nicely for me on my OS 10.6.8 Mac, running on -testnet."
