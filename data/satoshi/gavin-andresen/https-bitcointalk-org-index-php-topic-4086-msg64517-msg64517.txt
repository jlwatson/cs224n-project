  
That's just dumb.  
  
If the problem is jsonrpc-supporting-environments that don't support double-
precision floats, then multiplying and slapping a zero on the end won't fix
the problem-- you'll just either lose precision as it gets squeezed into a
32-bit float or get a 32-bit-integer-overflow error.
