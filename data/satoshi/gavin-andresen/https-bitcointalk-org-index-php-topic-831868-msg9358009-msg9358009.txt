You can mitigate the attacks described in the paper by running bitcoind with
more lenient banning behavior.  
  
E.g. put this in your bitcoin.conf:  
  

Code:

bantime=11

  
... so if Tor peers sharing an IP address are banned, they are only banned for
eleven seconds.  
  
If you want to live dangerously, you can also set:  
  

Code:

banscore=10000

  
... to make it a lot harder for an attacker to cause you to ban naughty IP
addresses. But this might make it easier for an attacker to fill up your
node's memory with garbage.
