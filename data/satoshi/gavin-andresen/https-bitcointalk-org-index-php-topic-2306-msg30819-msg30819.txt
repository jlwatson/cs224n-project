... and I just noticed an egregious bug: listtransactions was reporting the
receiving address instead of the account name for "receive" transactions. Fix
is svn rev 104. Please bang on it and let me know if I screwed anything else
up.  
  
While I was committing, I also added "time" to transaction info output, and
fixed a little bug reported a while ago (setgenerate true 0 is now the same as
setgenerate false).
