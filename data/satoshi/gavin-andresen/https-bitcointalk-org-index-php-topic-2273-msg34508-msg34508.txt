I agree it is natural to want to know who sends you the money. That would be a
nice feature to add to Bitcoin.  
  
Showing a 'from' address in bitcoin as it is now won't give you that feature,
it will give you something that kind-of, sort-of, maybe-most-of-the-time works
like that feature.  
  
And it's not obvious how to implement a "where did these bitcoins come from?"
feature.
