I had no idea GibbsSamplePlatter / instagibbs / Greg S  were all the same person.  The last email I got from you just said "Thanks, I'll take a look this morning" and I didn't connect the comment on the gist to you.

The gist is:  https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/54f6e24b830781aae1f4

Your comment there is very high-level-philosophical -- I don't see any invitation to respond, the tone of that comment seems to be "we'll get around to figuring it out eventually."
