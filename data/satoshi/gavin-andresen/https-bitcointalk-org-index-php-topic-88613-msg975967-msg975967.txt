The RPC and GUI won't let you spend 0-confirmation transactions unless they
are 'change' outputs from yourself.  
  
If you REALLY want to shoot yourself in the foot, I've got a pull request for
the 0.7 release that adds 'raw transaction' RPC commands that will let you do
all sorts of dangerous things, including ~~counting your chickens before
they've hatched~~ spending unconfirmed-from-somewhere-else inputs.
