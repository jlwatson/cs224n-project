 _There's nothing keeping anything or anyone honest._ There's _no
accountability_  
  
People don't want government involvement yet how is anyone/anything held
accountable? Vigilante justice?  

  
Private insurance with reliable, reputable insurance companies. Private bonds
deposited into reliable, reputable financial institutions.  
  
All of which cost money, which was a problem a year ago when nobody really
knew much of anything about bitcoin.  
  
We need legal contracts with businesses that are in a legal jurisdictions
where the contracts can be enforced in court. I don't think we'll get a non-
governmental legal system in my lifetime, so I'm personally happy to rely on
the imperfect government courts we've got today.
