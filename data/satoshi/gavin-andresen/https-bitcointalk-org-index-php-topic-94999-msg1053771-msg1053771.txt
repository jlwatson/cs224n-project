There MIGHT be riskes with signing public/private keys, but I don't know
enough about ECDSA to prove it false or true.  

"We" thought of that (where "we" was actually Khalahan and Pieter and Gregory,
if I recall correctly).  
  
The string "Bitcoin Signed Message:\n" is prepended to the message as salt,
then that's SHA256-hashed twice, and the hash is what is signed/verified. Sign
anything you like, it won't reveal information about your keys (unless your
OpenSLL implementation has a broken random number generator and doesn't
generate unique signing nonces).
