Giving them all the same starting wallet is a bad idea; they will start out
with the same keys, but will eventually each generate their own, so their
balances will drift out of sync.  
  
In theory everything should work out, but in practice using the same wallet on
multiple machines hasn't been tested much (I fixed a couple of bugs in the
last couple of weeks related to a wallet shared between machines).  
  
So before cloning, delete the wallet.dat (assuming it has no bitcoins in it)
and let the clones automatically generate a new wallet the first time they
start.
