I want to add that the best coin to copy for this is Devcoin. They have a
model where when I block is mined, 10% of the coins in that block go to the
miner, while the other 90% goes in the wallet of a writer.  

  
If I am a good writer, why would I pay out 10% of my income? That is more
expensive than credit card charges!  
  
Again, don't confuse money for wealth. Writers produce wealth in the form of
the stories/articles/whatever they are writing. The currency used to trade
that wealth only matters as far as:  
  
\+ What can the writer buy with it  
\+ If the writer saves it, will it buy more or less in the future
