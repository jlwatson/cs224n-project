Satoshi once suggested that people could hack their client to generate and
discard a bunch of random addresses until you got one that started with your
initials or even your name if it was short.  

  
I wrote a 'vanity bitcoin address' patch a while ago that lets you do exactly
that: https://gist.github.com/614460  
  
I bet finding an address starting 1HAL... wouldn't take more than a few hours.
If I recall, it took a day or so to find one with the string 'gavin' in it.
