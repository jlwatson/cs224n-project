  
Great suggestion, I will modify the code to refund the escrow fee (if any) and
donate the rest.  
  
  
I have some preliminary plans for mediated escrows that will require all three
parties to have ClearCoin accounts. I'm still thinking about how to make it as
simple to use as possible.  
  
Great idea, I'll put it on the "nice to have" list.  
  
Easy to do. How critical is time? Plus or minus 1 hour would be easy (there's
a 'cron job' that runs once per hour to process refunds), but I don't want to
make the Create an Escrow page more complicated than it really needs to be.  
  
I'll probably target transactions under $50 remaining free, and I'm thinking
of capping fees at $4... but it is likely I'll experiment with different
pricing models as I fill out features. Paying mediators (before and/or when
mediation is required) adds lots more wrinkles...  
Nope. Maybe I'll franchise later if Bitcoin and ClearCoin really take off.  
No-- what authentication method would you like to see? I don't like the idea
of supporting arbitrary OpenID authentication, because it is so easy to create
throwaway OpenID identities (creating throwaway Google identities is at least
a LITTLE bit harder...).
