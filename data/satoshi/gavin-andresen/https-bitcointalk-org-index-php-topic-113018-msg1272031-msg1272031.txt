I've updated the script. Now you only need to specify the URL of the
SHA256SUMS.asc file in question.  

  
Nice! You should submit a pull request to put a version of this in the
contrib/ directory; my only suggestion would be to make it take a version
string as an argument (and maybe automatically look in the test/ subdirectory
if it contains 'rc').
