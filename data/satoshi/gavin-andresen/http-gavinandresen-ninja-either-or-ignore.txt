Now that six months have gone past, I'm being asked if I still think Craig
Wright was Satoshi.

I think there are two possibilities.

Either he _was_ Satoshi, but **really** wants the world to think he isn 't, so
he created an impossible-to-untangle web of truths, half-truths and lies. And
ruined his reputation in the process.

If he was Satoshi, we should respect his wish to remain anonymous, and ignore
him.

The other possibility is he is a master scammer/fraudster who managed to trick
some pretty smart people over a period of several years.

In which case everybody except the victims of his fraud and law enforcement
working on behalf of those victims should ignore him.

So, either he was or he wasn't. In either case, we should ignore him. I regret
ever getting involved in the "who was Satoshi" game, and am going to spend my
time on more fun and productive pursuits.
