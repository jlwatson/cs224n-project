This is the kind of analysis that I think we need more of before jumping to
the conclusion that there is actually a problem that needs to be fixed. I'm
not claiming that HorseRider is correct, but his logic looks plausible and I
tend to listen harder to reasonable people who say things like "please check
whether my logic is right".
