In this paper, we show that the polynomial scaling of SA (Shor's algorithm) is
destroyed by input errors to the QFT part of the algorithm. We also show that
Quantum Error Correcting Codes (QECC) are not capable of suppressing errors
due to operator imprecision and that propagation of operator precision errors
is sufficient to severely degrade the effectiveness of SA. Additionally we
show that operator imprecision in the error correction circuit for the
Calderbank-Shor-Steane QECC is mathematically equivalent to decoherence on
every physical qubit in a register. We conclude that, because of the effect of
operator precision errors, it is likely that physically realizable quantum
computers will be capable of factoring integers no more efficiently than
classical computers.

I don't see any published rebuttals in a quick Google Scholar search. Maybe
there will be a breakthrough (or already has been... any QC wizards listening
here?) in handling the fuzziness of quantum calculations as you scale up the
number of qbits, but 256-bit ECDSA looks pretty darn secure to me right now.
