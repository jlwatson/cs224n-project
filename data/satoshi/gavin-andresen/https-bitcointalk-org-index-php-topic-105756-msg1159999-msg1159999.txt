From "Operator Imprecision and Scaling of Shor's Algorithm" (2008):  
  
I don't see any published rebuttals in a quick Google Scholar search. Maybe
there will be a breakthrough (or already has been... any QC wizards listening
here?) in handling the fuzziness of quantum calculations as you scale up the
number of qbits, but 256-bit ECDSA looks pretty darn secure to me right now.
