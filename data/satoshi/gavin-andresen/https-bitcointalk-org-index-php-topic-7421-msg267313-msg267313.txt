I took error's work and further tweaked so it works (and is rebased against)
latest git head.  
  
... but I'm not 100% happy with it. I'm not sure it properly handles block
chain re-orgs and dependent orphan transactions. Would be nice to write some
tests to exercise those edge cases, and figure out what it SHOULD do in those
cases.
