I'm definitely not in the "speculators are evil" camp. Speculation for the
right reasons (hedging risk, for example) is a very good thing.  
  
I personally think speculation for the thrill of gambling is not a good thing,
but I'm also not in the "Every Bad Thing (where I get to decide what Bad and
Good is) Should Be Illegal" camp. If you want to gamble you should be free to
do so; I think it is stupid that we let rich people on Wall Street gamble with
other people's money and yet have laws that make it illegal for not-so-rich
people to gamble with their own money.  
  
From his post, Tong thought about Bitcoinica and decided that he could be more
effective at making the world a better place by working on something else that
is more obviously positive-sum. Good for him!
