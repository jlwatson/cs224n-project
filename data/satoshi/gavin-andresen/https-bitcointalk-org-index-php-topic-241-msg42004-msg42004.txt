  
That would make an odd transaction pattern-- e.g. if you started with 11
bitcoins in your wallet, you'd generate a chain of transactions that was:  
  
A paid B 11 bitcoins  
B paid C 11 bitcoins  
C paid D 11 bitcoins  
... etc, every 6 hours. That makes it obvious what you're doing (a series of
exactly-11-bitcoin transactions would be extremely unlikely).  
  
Ideally, you want the graph of transactions involving your coins to be
indistinguishable from a random sub-graph of the entire bitcoin transaction
graph. Creating lots of wallets won't help you do that; you need to mix your
coins with other people's, so the mixing looks the same as just ordinary "X
paid Y" transactions.
