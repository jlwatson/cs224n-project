Agreed. However, splitting the functionality across processes that communicate
using a clear interface would allow wallet handling code to run on secure
back-end machines without direct internet connections.  

  
But again: if that clear interface includes a command to "send XYZ bitcoins to
some address", then how is the separation making you more secure?
