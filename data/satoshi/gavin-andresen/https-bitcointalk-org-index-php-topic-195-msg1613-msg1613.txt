I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a
good idea. So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly
identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace
to the network. The MIT license is compatible with all other licenses and
commercial uses, so there is no need to rewrite it from a licensing
standpoint.  

Good idea or not, SOMEBODY will try to mess up the network (or co-opt it for
their own use) sooner or later. They'll either hack the existing code or write
their own version, and will be a menace to the network.  
  
I admire the flexibility of the scripts-in-a-transaction scheme, but my evil
little mind immediately starts to think of ways I might abuse it. I could
encode all sorts of interesting information in the TxOut script, and if non-
hacked clients validated-and-then-ignored those transactions it would be a
useful covert broadcast communication channel.  
  
That's a cool feature until it gets popular and somebody decides it would be
fun to flood the payment network with millions of transactions to transfer the
latest Lady Gaga video to all their friends...
