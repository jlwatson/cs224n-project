I wrote some code that found all blocks with "/P2SH/" in their coinbase that
did not include transaction fees in the block reward. I extracted the block
reward payment address (or addresses, if it was a p2pool block) and reimbursed
those addresses.  
  
If the amount would be less than 0.0011 bitcoins, then I rounded the amount
awarded up to 0.0011. Just because eleven is my favorite number (well, and
because I like the idea of rewarding p2pool users, I think p2pool is neat).
