A bug in my code is dropping transaction fees from the block reward. Simple to
fix, and obvious in hindsight; I will be personally reimbursing everybody who
got bit by this bug by finding the blocks affected by this, figuring out what
transaction fees the creators SHOULD have received, and sending that number of
bitcoins to the block-award address.  

  
Transaction sent:
2d3006cf1e16cb9f4097894fdaa0739c66d38eb9e0356be3fd8daf63810cf375  
  
I wrote some code that found all blocks with "/P2SH/" in their coinbase that
did not include transaction fees in the block reward. I extracted the block
reward payment address (or addresses, if it was a p2pool block) and reimbursed
those addresses.  
  
If the amount would be less than 0.0011 bitcoins, then I rounded the amount
awarded up to 0.0011. Just because eleven is my favorite number (well, and
because I like the idea of rewarding p2pool users, I think p2pool is neat).
