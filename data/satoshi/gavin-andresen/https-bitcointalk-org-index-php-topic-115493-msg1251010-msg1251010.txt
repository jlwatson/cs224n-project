  
No, that's the point: you can take any validly signed bitcoin transactions,
tweak the signature(s) in various ways, and create variations that are also
validly signed but have a different txid. We've known that for a long time.  
  
You cannot change where the coins came from or where they go or any other
information about the transaction that is covered by the signature(s).  
  
And the current reference bitcoin implementation will simply take the first
variation it sees and consider it valid. Sergio is saying that if there are
any merchants doing their own double-spend detection they should be aware of
this issue.
