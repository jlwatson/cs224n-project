  
You don't need the whole network to support transaction replacement to do
that; just write some code that holds a time-locked transaction, has a way of
replacing it with another time-locked transaction, and have it automatically
broadcast the transaction onto the network if not replaced before the time-
lock expires.  
  
It would be more convenient to have the whole network support transaction
replacement, but I don't think it is reasonable for the whole network to
remember everybody's dead-man-switch transactions. And even if they did, you'd
run the risk that a miner eager to get an extra transaction fee would ignore a
newer version of the transaction and mine the old transaction.
