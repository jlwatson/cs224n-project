And just to be clear, this rule will fork the test blockchain between those
running on the current or prior versions of the client, and those running on
whatever version this change comes out in, right?  

  
Yes.  
  
Any opinions on whether to do a hard reset (new genesis block with the new
rules) or a split ("new rules apply to blocks with timestamps after XYZ") ?  
  
  
RE: scaling down difficulty: good idea if we were thinking of implementing
something like this for the main network. But I'd want to give everybody lots
of time to think long and hard about potential hacks/exploits/unintended
consequences if this was being considered for the main network-- sudden drops
in hashing power is NOT a problem for the main network, so I don't think it is
worth considering now.
