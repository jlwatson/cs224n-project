you have made irresponsible decisions in the past, and I don't trust that you
would handle sensitive security issues responsibly. Happily there have been
approximately zero cross-implementation security issues in the last six
months, so it is more of a theoretical issue that you're not on the list....  
  
RE: foundation phone call: I personally agree that fundraising for a vaporware
wallet is less newsworthy than a 9 million dollar reputable VC investment.  
  
RE: libbitcoin: when there is significant software using it and it has been
"battle tested" a bit I'd be happy to mention it. But last I heard even
Intersango was not using it because it was too slow/immature.
