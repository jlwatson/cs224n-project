Thanks for all the positive, constructive feedback (those of you who gave
positive, constructive feedback). I'm not going to address conspiracy
theories, mostly because I'm not seeing most of them because of who I've got
on my ignore list.  
  
The points people made here about the Foundation making Bitcoin MORE
decentralized are, from my point of view, exactly right. To take one example,
I don't want to be the centralized decision-maker who figures out who should
or should not be on the bitcoin-press mailing list that is on the bitcoin.org
homepage any more. To take another: if there is money for the development
team, I don't want to decide how to split it up (I've got an obvious conflict
of interest).  
  
RE: why Peter and why not anonymous members and why DC and why not a different
process to start:  
  
Because I'm pragmatic. I like to actually get things accomplished instead of
endlessly talking about doing things. Everybody on the initial Board are
people who get things done.  
  
My biggest fear is not that the Foundation will become some massively powerful
entity controlling Bitcoin; my biggest fear is that the Foundation will turn
into Yet Another Ineffective Bureaucracy, employing a few people who do
nothing but put out meaningless press releases.  
  
RE: confirmation-of-payment emails: that will be done soon.  
  
RE: bylaws:  
  
In the spirit of openness, the Foundation bylaws are on github:

These bylaws are distributed under the MIT License and may be forked for use
in creating any new member-driven nonprofit corporation or for any other use.

  
Creating forums or mailing lists where Foundation members can communicate is
on the very short-term TODO list.  
  
Thanks again to everybody who has already joined, it is exciting to see people
from all over the world get involved!
