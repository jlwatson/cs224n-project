That generates a new address for new CGI script invocation (== each page
view).  
  
An attacker, or just a popular web page, could fill your wallet with never-
used addresses.  

Well, a new address would only be generated on each visit of the "donate"
page, not the main page. I don't think it would be that much space consuming
on disk.  
  
Also, is there any other way to prevent public to know how much have been
donated ?  

  
getaccountaddress is designed for exactly this kind of thing-- it will return
the same address over and over, until it gets used (until somebody donates).
After that, it returns a different address...  
  
Of course, if "the public" is grabbing the donation address off your "Donate
to Us" page, they could generate a list of donation addresses, add up the
donations received on all those addresses, and figure it out. Depending on how
many donations you're getting that might be easy (scrape the page once per
day) or hard (if you're getting dozens of donations per day).  
  
You could make it much harder for anybody to figure out how much you're
getting in donations by randomly donating to yourself (using the same address
returned by getaccountaddress), preferably from a wallet shared by lots of
other people (like a MyBitcoin or Mt.Gox account)...
