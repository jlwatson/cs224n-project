I updated most of my git branches to svn rev 161 last night, including
monitorreceived. That's easy:  
git svn fetch (but you have to have an "svn-remote" setup in your .git/config)  
git merge refs/remotes/svn/trunk (I could git rebase instead, but merge seems
less magical to me)  
... fix any merge conflicts and test then git commit, if needed (usually there
are none)  
git push (to push up to github)  
  
Repeated on each branch (I'll try to keep svn, svnTEST and monitorreceived up-
to-date).  
  
Keeping the patch file up-to-date is another couple of steps, and I
could/should automate it.  
  
doublec: thanks for the bug report, I'll look into it as soon as I get this
machine setup.
