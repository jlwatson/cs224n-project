Bug. I never tested the combination of signing a pay-to-script-hash
transaction with non-wallet private keys.  
  
I'm not 100% sure how to fix it, though. The problem is private keys, public
keys, and P2SH scripts are all stored in a "keystore." When you give the third
argument to signrawtransaction, it creates a keystore that contains just the
private keys (and the corresponding public keys) that you give, and uses that
to sign the transaction.  
  
There's currently no way to give it the P2SH script that corresponds to
34y6HmY6zTH51KTC9vd36HasNL4kLKcisC, but the transaction signing code needs
that information.  
  
I think the right fix is to give signrawtransaction both the private key(s)
and any P2SH information needed...
