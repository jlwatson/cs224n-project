  
That's like saying: "Gold atoms are unstable because quantum mechanics tells
us that there is a >0 possibility that they will spontaneously decay."  
  
Yes, in the very very very long run the universe will suffer heat death and
there will be no gold (or any other atoms) left.  
  
If the probability of bank runs is very small, then fractional reserve banking
works. Or, in other words, if banks can establish and maintain trust in their
ability to repay deposits they'll be stable even if they practice fractional
reserve banking.  
  
I hope we'll eventually find out the hard way if, or which, Bitcoin banks can
establish and maintain trust.
