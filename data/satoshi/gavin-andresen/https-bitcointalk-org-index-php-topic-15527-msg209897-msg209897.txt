As long as the questions are core-bitcoin-related and not specific to your
alternative client.  
  
Good alternative client question: "I'm writing an alternative client that
doesn't store private keys at all (they are generated from the user's
password). But I'll need a bitcoin protocol message that does XYZ to make it
work; are other clients willing to support that new message?"  
  
Bad alternative client question: "I'm coding my alternative client in Forth;
what's the best GUI toolkit to use?"
