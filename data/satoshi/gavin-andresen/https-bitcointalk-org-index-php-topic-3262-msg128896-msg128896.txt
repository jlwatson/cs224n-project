Well, wouldn't it have been possible to start with a digital currency that had
a fixed, unchanging number of units, and used a transaction cost scheme as the
incentive structure from the start?  

Sure, we'll call it GavinCoin and I get all the coins to start.  
  
If you want some, you just send me some of that worthless fiat currency that
you have laying around.  
  
Sound good?
