Your proposal seems needlessly complicated.  
  
How about:  
  
The vending machine talks to a "Bitcoin+ Payment Verification Systems,
Incorporated" server.  
  
The Bitcoin+ Payment Verification System is basically just a bitcoin node,
with really fast international network connections and a little extra code to
detect attempted double-spends. If it detects a double-spend attempt, it
rejects the transaction. Otherwise, it accepts the transaction and blasts the
transaction into the payment network over its really fast, as-low-latency-as-
possible connections.  
  
If it later turns out that the transaction actually WAS invalid, Bitcoin+
Payment Verification Systems, Incorporated absorbs the cost of the fraud.  
Bitcoin+ Payment Verification Systems, Incorporated, of course, charges the
vending machine merchant a fee for providing such excellent service. They're
constantly competing with their arch-rivals, "Better Merchant Services,
Incorporated" to balance latency, fees, and fraud to maximize profit.
