Actually, I'm surprised Mark doesn't remember (or maybe he just didn't want to
get bogged down in details)-- he paid for my lunch, and I paid him back in
Bitcoins.  
  
Which turned out to be a good deal for him, they went from about 40cents
apiece to something like 60cents apiece in the week or so it took him to setup
a bitcoin account and give me his receiving address (I paid at the 'when we
had lunch' exchange rate, of course).  
  
If you have a bitcoin business and are thinking about advertising, FTL
listeners might be a receptive market-- and I bet you might be able to
convince Mark and Ian to take payment in bitcoin.
