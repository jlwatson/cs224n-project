Money can be used as both a means of exchange and a store of value.  
  
I plan on using Bitcoins as a convenient, very-low-cost means of exchange.  
  
I don't plan on saving a significant number of Bitcoins as a store of value. I
like to invest in people who are doing productive things that grow our economy
and make the world a better place, so when Bitcoins replace dollars  I'll lend
them to people by buying bonds or stocks.  
  
If you only use Bitcoins as a means of exchange, then you don't have to worry
much about a sudden loss of faith in the system.  
  
If you use Bitcoins as a store of value... well, then you're a currency
speculator, which can be highly profitable but is also highly risky. Whether
you're hoarding dollars or euros or yen or Bitcoins...
