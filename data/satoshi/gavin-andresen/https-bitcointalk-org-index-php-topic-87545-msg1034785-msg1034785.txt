Any ideas when this will get included into the main build?  

It was pulled into what will become the 0.7 release a while ago.  
  
Documentation is now on the wiki: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Raw_Transactions  
  
I decided not to abbreviate "transaction" -- none of the other RPC calls use
abbreviations. And the features have been tweaked a little bit.  
  
There are some nice unintended-but-useful things you can do with it-- as
documented on the wiki page:  
  
 **Re-broadcast a transaction**  
If you want to re-broadcast a transaction right away, you can use the
getrawtransaction and sendrawtransaction API calls to do that. As a bash
shell-script one-liner it would be:  

Code:

sendrawtransaction $(getrawtransaction $TXID)

(note that Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind automatically re-transmit wallet transactions
periodically until they are accepted into a block).  
  
 **Validate a transaction without broadcasting it**  
If you have a raw transaction and want to make sure all of it's signatures are
correct, you can use the signrawtransaction API call. Pass in the hex-encoded
raw transaction, any inputs that bitcoind doesn't yet know about, and an empty
array of private keys to use to sign the transaction. Passing an empty array
of private keys will prevent signrawtransaction from doing any signing; if it
returns "complete":1 then all of the existing signatures are valid and there
are no signatures missing.
