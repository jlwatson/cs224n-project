is 0.6.0 still on track for release today?  

  
We might re-spin the release with just updated translations.  
  
There is one serious issue affecting a few people
(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=74447.0) but because it is a one-time
problem when you upgrade from an older release and has a pretty simple
workaround (remove your addr.dat file and re-run), we may release with it as a
Known Issue.  
  
If there are any Berkeley DB database experts reading this we could use your
help figuring out what the heck is going on...
