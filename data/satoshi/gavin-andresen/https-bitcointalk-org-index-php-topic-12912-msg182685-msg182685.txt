Buying lots of bitcoins with dollars, driving the price up (and maybe creating
an expectations bubble), then waiting for the price to stabilize before
selling all you've bought (hoping to create panic selling) would, in my humble
opinion, be an effective attack by anybody who had a lot of money to spend,
didn't mind making the owners of the bitcoin exchanges very wealthy, and
wanted to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the bitcoin market.  
  
Of course, if there was somebody with a lot of bitcoins willing to sell on the
way up and buy on the way down to stabilize prices...
