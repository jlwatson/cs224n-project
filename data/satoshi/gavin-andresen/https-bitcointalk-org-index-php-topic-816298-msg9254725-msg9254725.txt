  
Is there really any disagreement? Everybody I have talked with believes that
transaction fees will rise if Bitcoin is successful and the 1MB limit is kept.  
  
How much we won't know-- that depends on how much demand for transactions
moves somewhere else (fiat currency, altcoin, or some off-blockchain
solution).  
  
There is a small minority of people who believe that it would be BETTER if
transactions moved to fiat currency, an altcoin, or some more-centralized off-
blockchain solution. I strongly disagree.
