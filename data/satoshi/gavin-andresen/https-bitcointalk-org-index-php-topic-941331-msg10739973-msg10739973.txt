Let's put a bullet in the head of this argument once and for all.  
If people drive away, it frees up space in blocks, it's a self-correcting
problem that nicely filters out people that thought they needed the Bitcoin-
level bulletproof security level and finally realize they didn't.  

  
With economic reasoning like that, I see why Paymium has such low transaction
volume (if you're making massive profits because your costs are so much lower
processing so many fewer transactions than the bigger exchanges, then I'll
adjust my priors).
