We are currently working on a countermeasure. In particular we wonder how  
reducing from eight to four entry nodes would effect the bitcoin network.  
We also think to decay the connections based on the number of transactions  
(for example renewing half of the entry node connections after each  
transaction). It might be interesting to include a proof of work for  
creation of connections, but this would create a compatibility issue.  

  
Excellent!  
  
I've been accused in the past of "not caring about privacy" -- when I do care
a lot about privacy. But I am not a privacy researcher, and I have a deep
respect for how difficult it is to create a truly privacy-preserving system.  
  
I'm very happy that somebody who **is** an expert is thinking about, and
working on, countermeasures.
