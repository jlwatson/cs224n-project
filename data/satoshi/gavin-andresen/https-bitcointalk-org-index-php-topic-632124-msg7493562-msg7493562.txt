  
Excellent!  
  
I've been accused in the past of "not caring about privacy" -- when I do care
a lot about privacy. But I am not a privacy researcher, and I have a deep
respect for how difficult it is to create a truly privacy-preserving system.  
  
I'm very happy that somebody who **is** an expert is thinking about, and
working on, countermeasures.
