I'd assume they have rules and try to make them as clearly written as
possible.  

  
So one of my pet peeves is the United States Legal System.  
  
It has lots of rules. The problem is nobody can possibly read them all. And
yet "ignorance of the law is no excuse!"  
  
I'm a big fan of a few general, fuzzy rules and common sense.
