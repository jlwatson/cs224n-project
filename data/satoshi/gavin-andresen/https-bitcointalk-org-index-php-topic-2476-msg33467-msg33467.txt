Can we brainstorm positive emotional arguments? Maybe:  
  
* Get back at the bankers and megacorporations that robbed us blind and drove the economy over a cliff!  
  
* Bitcoin is The People's Money-- created by YOU, controlled by YOU.  
  
* Use bitcoin and tell (PayPal/your credit card company/the foreign currency exchanger) you're tired of paying outrageous fees just to send YOUR money to somebody else.
