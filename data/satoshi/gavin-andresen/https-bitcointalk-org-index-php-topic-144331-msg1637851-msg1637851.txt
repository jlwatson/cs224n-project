The bottleneck for getting this pulled is testing.  
  
It needs a thorough test plan that tries to test edge cases where things might
break, and then it needs people to carry out that test plan to make sure it is
solid. "It works for me" isn't good enough for wallet-touching code.  
  
See https://github.com/bitcoin/QA for a suggested process.
