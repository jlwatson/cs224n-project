It is not clear to me that Metcalfe's law applies right now, but I know how you can convince me:

Find an estimate of number of Bitcoin users over time. Blockchain.info's number of wallet users is probably good enough.

Find number of transactions on the chain over time.

Then plot transactions-per-user over time. If it is exponential, then I will agree Metcalfe's law holds.
