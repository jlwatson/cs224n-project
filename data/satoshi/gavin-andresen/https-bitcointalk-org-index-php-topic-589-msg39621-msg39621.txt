Run one instance normally. It'll listen for incoming bitcoin network
connections on port 8333, rpc connections on port 8332, and connect to other
nodes.  
  
Run the other instance with a different -datadir, and a bitcoin.conf like
this:  
nolisten=1  
rpcport=7332 (or whatever you like)  
noirc=1  
connect=127.0.0.1:8333  
  
You'll need to be running the latest source code from github for the nolisten
option.  
  
The noirc and connect settings aren't strictly necessary; leave them out and
the second instance will make 8 outgoing connections to other bitcoin nodes.
You'll save a little network bandwidth if the nolisten instance only connects
to the other node.
