Here's my use case: suppose I have a potentially large number of users making
transfers directed towards me (each using a separate account). My application
will need to periodically poll the bitcoin daemon to find out what new
transfers have been confirmed, so it can update the user's account/assets on
the application side.  

  
Two thoughts:  
  
listaccounts [minconfirmations] (also new in 0.3.20, if I'm remembering
correctly) will give you all accounts and their balances. If an account's
balance doesn't change, you know it hasn't received coins.  
  
And why do you need to periodically update the user's account/assets? Could
you just query bitcoind for their current balance when they fetch their
'account status' page (or wherever you show the user how many bitcoins they
have)? Are you doing something with the received bitcoins without an explicit
action on the part of the user, and does that something care about the total
balance or individual transactions?
