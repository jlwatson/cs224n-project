  
Two thoughts:  
  
listaccounts [minconfirmations] (also new in 0.3.20, if I'm remembering
correctly) will give you all accounts and their balances. If an account's
balance doesn't change, you know it hasn't received coins.  
  
And why do you need to periodically update the user's account/assets? Could
you just query bitcoind for their current balance when they fetch their
'account status' page (or wherever you show the user how many bitcoins they
have)? Are you doing something with the received bitcoins without an explicit
action on the part of the user, and does that something care about the total
balance or individual transactions?
