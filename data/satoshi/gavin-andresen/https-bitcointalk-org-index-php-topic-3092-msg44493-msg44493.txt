But going back to my original question: is there a unique way to identify a
block even in the face of reorgs?  

  
Sure, every block has a unique hash.  
  
But I don't think that helps at all; you might see that transactions A B C D
are in block #100,000 with hash H1, but after a block chain re-org block
#100,000 might contain transactions A D (with block hash H2).  
  
The probability of that happening rapidly approaches zero as the block gets
confirmed; after 6 confirmations you can safely assume it just won't happen.
