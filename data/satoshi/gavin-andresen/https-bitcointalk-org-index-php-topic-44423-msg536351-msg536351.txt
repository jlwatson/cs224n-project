He never stated it's faster. And it likely isn't if the pattern is big enough:
GPU's can't access memory nearly as well as CPUs.  

GPUs suck at accessing main memory.  
  
But they're very, very good at accessing on-board memory. See, for example

CUDA-enabled GPU offers up to 8X the speed of main memory and 4X the speed of
L1-cache compared to a moderne CPU...  

I predict it'll take... mmm... 3 weeks after source code is released for the
first faster-on-a-GPU solidcoin 2.0 closed-source miner to come out. 8 weeks
until there's an open-source one available.  
  
But my predictions are often wrong.
