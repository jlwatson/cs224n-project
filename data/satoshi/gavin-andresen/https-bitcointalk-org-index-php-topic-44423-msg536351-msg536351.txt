GPUs suck at accessing main memory.  
  
But they're very, very good at accessing on-board memory. See, for example

I predict it'll take... mmm... 3 weeks after source code is released for the
first faster-on-a-GPU solidcoin 2.0 closed-source miner to come out. 8 weeks
until there's an open-source one available.  
  
But my predictions are often wrong.
