  
Thanks for checking my math! I used 31-day months, since I assume that is how
ISPs do the bandwidth cap.  
  
RE: what happens with Tor:  
  
Run a full node (or better, several full nodes) that is connected to the
network directly-- not via Tor.  
  
But to keep your transactions private, you broadcast them through a Tor-
connected SPV (not full) node. If you are mining, broadcast new blocks the
same way.  
  
That gives you fully-validating-node security plus transaction/block privacy.
You could run both the full node and the SPV-Tor-connected node on a machine
at home; to the rest of the network your home IP address would look like a
relay node that never generated any transactions or blocks.  
  
If you live in a country where even just connecting to the Bitcoin network is
illegal (or would draw unwelcome attention to yourself), then you'd need to
pay for a server somewhere else and administer it via Tor.
