There can be many bitcoin client implementations and many implementations of the consensus code.

There may be implementation bugs in those many codebases that cause them to lose consensus with the rest of the network-- and we've seen several variations of that even with a SINGLE codebase. Bitcoin Core versions prior to 0.7 could self-fork, even if running on identical hardware.
Versions prior to BIP66 roll out could fork on 32-bit versus 64-bit machines.

The bugs get fixed, and blockchain consensus marches on. I call Core the "reference implementation" and not "The One True Implementation" ....
