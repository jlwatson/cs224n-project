As Bitcoiner had pointed out, bubbles must be in relation to another asset.
Bitcoin experiencing a "bubble" in this case seems to be tied more to global
instability than the Bitcoin system itself. Rather than a bubble, it looks
like a deflationary escape from other assets (not always the same ones)
mirrored by a rise in Bitcoin.  

  
I think the rise from less than $1 per bitcoin to over $30 per bitcoin was
purely a speculative bubble, fueled by all the press/publicity. Even in the
absence of global financial uneasiness I think a bubble was inevitable; maybe
a lot of the interest in Bitcoin is/was driven by people looking for a
deflationary escape, but I doubt it. Measure bitcoin prices in milligrams of
gold (the time-tested deflationary escape) and you'll still see a big bubble
and pop over the last few months.  
  
I think it will be years (if we're lucky) before a significant number of
investors look at Bitcoin as a deflationary escape from other assets.  
  
What's your prediction for the number of bitcoin bubbles over the next three
years? (measured against whatever basket of currencies or assets you like) I
based my projections on "feels about right to me."
