So netrin:  
  
I asked before and I'll ask again, I'm genuinely curious:  
  
Are there password-cracking algorithms that attempt passwords from lowest-
entropy-to-highest-entropy?  
  
Is it even theoretically possible to sort passwords by "entropy" ? (seems like
a hard thing to easily measure; password "a.b..c...d....e.....f" has low
entropy, but would any password-cracking algorithm try it before 6 random
characters?)
