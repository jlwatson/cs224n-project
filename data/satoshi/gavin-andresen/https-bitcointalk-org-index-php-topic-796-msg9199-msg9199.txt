So you have a theory of distribution and need a currency to implement it? I
suppose a Bitcoin-like currency could be modified to behave in this manner.  

I see two fundamental problems with using a Bitcoin-like system to implement a
Universal-Dividend-like system:  
  
1\. How does the system identify "individuals" ? If you've got a completely
automated way of doing that I **really** want to know about it!
freebitcoins.appspot.com could really use a foolproof system for identifying
individuals.  
  
2\. If everybody gets a dividend, why would anybody bother running a block-
generating node? What is the incentive for doing the work needed to support
the system?
