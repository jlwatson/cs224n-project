Yeah, cool!  
  
Could you punch a couple of holes through the B? I like topologically
interesting money.  
  
And if you want to make it the absolutely coolest coin in the world, generate
a new bitcoin address, send 1 bitcoin to it, and then engrave that address on
the coin.  
  
Then you have physical currency that the owner can independently check to make
sure the bitcoin backing it hasn't been spent.
