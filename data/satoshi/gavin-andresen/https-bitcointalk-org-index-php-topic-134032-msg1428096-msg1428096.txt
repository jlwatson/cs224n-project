How will you know if people tend to pick the same types of events, and,
therefore, create big non-random clusters of choices that might be easily
brute-forced?  
  
Taking an idea from https://gist.github.com/3840286...  
  
.... you could store a small number of bitcoin at private key =
SHA256(memory_key), store the bulk of bitcoin at scrypt(Name+PIN+memory_key),
and tell users to choose a new memory key if the SHA256(memory_key) coins are
either ever spent or if that key ever gets funds from somebody else.  
  
Because that means somebody else chose the same memory key.
