In another thread venom said:  
So the short answer is that BC is backed by mathematics/cryptography and the
"wisdom of crowds"; assuming there's no flaw in the algorithms, and assuming
that there is no grand conspiracy of more than half of the BC nodes, it is
impossible to inflate the currency or make fraudulent payments.  
  
I don't believe in grand conspiracies, so that doesn't worry me. And I can't
see any flaw in the algorithms... but that's where I'm skeptical (there might
be bugs in the BC code, but those can and will be easily fixed).  
  
Are there any professional cryptographers looking at Bitcoin?  
Or will they only get interested if/when Bitcoin gets popular?
