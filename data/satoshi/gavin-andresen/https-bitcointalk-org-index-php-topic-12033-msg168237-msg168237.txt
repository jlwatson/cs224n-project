Diversifying is a good strategy.  
  
I wouldn't trust that an Internet cafe computer was safe; if I were you, I
might buy some bitbills ( bitbills.com ) and have them mailed to your home
address. I ordered some bitbills shortly before I left for France and the
mailman delivered them to me with the rest of my held mail when I got home.
