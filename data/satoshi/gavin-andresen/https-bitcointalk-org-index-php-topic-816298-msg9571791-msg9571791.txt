  
There seem to be a few people who want some OTHER algorithm for increasing the
block size, but I'm hearing very broad consensus that we do need a hard fork
to increase the size.  
  
That is progress.  
  
I'll be running some experiments using actual blockchain data to see where the
current code breaks; if it can already handle 20MB blocks then I'll work
through the details to propose a hard fork (write BIPs, write code, write
tests, ...).
