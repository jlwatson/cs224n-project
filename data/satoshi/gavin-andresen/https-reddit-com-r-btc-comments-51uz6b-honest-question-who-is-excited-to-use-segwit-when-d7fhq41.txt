Your 'can't do it' attitude is really bad for Bitcoin.

Please take a break and find a role model of somebody with a successful product that has a thriving community. I'll bet you a bitcoin you find somebody with a positive 'git'er done' attitude that tries to harness everybody's talents and ideas and is usually helpful and encouraging.
