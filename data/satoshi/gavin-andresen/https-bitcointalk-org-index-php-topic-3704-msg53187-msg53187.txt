RE: a checklist:  
  
For the next release, I will write a script that does all of the build/package
steps. I'll let the computer run the checklist for me... and the whole process
should be much quicker, easier and smoother.  
  
RE: 0.3.20.01  
  
Fixed builds are at sourceforge, named 'bitcoin-0.3.20.01' to try to avoid
confusion.  
The mac build was 0.3.20.00 also; I am going to update that .zip when we get a
.01 build, and I think I'll rename the  
linux downloads to be consistent and, again, to try to avoid confusion.
