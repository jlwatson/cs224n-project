  
If the hashing algorithms are broken I might be able to generate an ECDSA
private/public key pair where the public key hashes to the same bitcoin
address as one of your public keys.  
  
If I can do that, then I can spend your coins.  
  
On my list of things to worry about, this is just below "Asteroid impact
destroys the earth" (but above "Aliens invade and make me their slave").
