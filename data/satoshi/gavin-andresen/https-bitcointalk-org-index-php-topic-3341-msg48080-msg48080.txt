Therefore, No. There will always be some circumstances in which your right to
conduct only voluntary and consensual relationships should not be respected by
all. In a pride of lions, the top male decides. In our society, at present,
there are laws which decide, but in a stateless society... damned if I know
who decides. I have a big problem with libertarianism and conflict resolution.
Help me to understand guys.  

  
I think you're confusing libertarian with minarchist or anarcho-capitalist.  
  
Libertarians generally agree that police and a legal system to resolve
disputes are a proper role for government.
