How the old miners will check the doublespending if money was spend earlier
with new transaction type?  

  
It is not a new transaction type-- transactions could always have multiple
TxOuts.  
  
However, to prevent a denial-of-service attack (which was actually attempted--
see block 71036) transactions with more than 2 TxOuts are currently dropped by
clients instead of relayed.  
  
Now that there is a need for it, the rules allow "reasonable" multi-output
transactions, but still denies "unreasonable" ones (reasonable means: is one
of the 2 standard transaction types and only does one ECDSA signature
verification per recipient).  
  
So: no, this won't cause a block chain split. And no, old miners will not
disagree with new miners, so double-spending is not possible.
