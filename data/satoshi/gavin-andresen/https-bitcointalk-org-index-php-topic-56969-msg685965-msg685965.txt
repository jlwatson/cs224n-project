You're right, it's unlikely anyone will accidentally do it. But I can
guarantee there are malicious people around just itching to cause a bit of
havoc in bitcoin. It would be best to plan for the case of "it will happen
that someone will mine a block" rather than "I don't think anyone would waste
time to".  

  
Right........

If we're still at 55% on Feb 7'th then I'll be worried, too, and might advise
miners to push the hard switchover date a couple of weeks (if they're using
the patches I'm creating then it is a command-line argument to bitcoind).  

  
Also, the worst case scenario isn't very scary-- worst case is the less-
than-50%-of-miners who did the switch find themselves on the short end of a
blockchain split, so they lose revenue (and transactions take longer to
confirm because the network is working on two different chains).  
  
That would motivate them to either quickly recruit more hashing power or
quickly switch back to the old rules.
