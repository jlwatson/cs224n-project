  
What partial pre-image? I assume the message being hashed is "Transfer THIS
domain to THAT public key." (with probably a timestamp thrown in there that
can't be too far ahead or behind current network time and, of course, a long
nonce)  
  
I imagine the hash-for-hire services would just ask their clients for the
public key; I know I wouldn't want a hash-for-hire service to have access to
my site's private key, they could sell it out from under me!  
  
RE: a personal website or small domain being evicted: yep. You should offer to
sell out for a couple bitcoins less than it will cost that big, evil
corporation to find an eviction hash so at least you get compensated. There's
very little difference between "legitimate little guy who's last name happens
to be Ford" and "domain squatter."
