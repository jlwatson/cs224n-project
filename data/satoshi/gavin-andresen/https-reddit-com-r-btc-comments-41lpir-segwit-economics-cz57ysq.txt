I will 'scream bloody murder' if anybody ever seriously suggests obsoleting old coins.

There are easy hard forks (like raising the block limit) and then there are really hard hard forks (like changing the POW or deciding that every transaction shall be coin-joined-by-the-miner ring-signature-based).

Really hard hard forks should never happen, they would be much too disruptive. Any benefits would clearly be outweighed by the costs/risks.
