At the moment there is no way in the bitcoin protocol to 'add a fee to a stuck
transaction' to entice a miner to pick it up which would be handy.  

That's not quite right.  
  
The protocol supports it-- just take the output of an unconfirmed transaction
(paying to you) and then broadcast a send-to-self transaction that uses it as
input and has a big, juicy fee.  
  
I think the Eligius mining pool might even notice and confirm both
transactions-- Luke DashJr has a pull request to change the reference
implementation's transaction selection code to consider fees for sets of
related transactions when deciding what to include in a block.
