Wiki for the trade page is a fantastic idea.  
  
And I like the idea of a re-organized, simplified home page. Who should the
home page target? I think there are few potential audiences; successful web
sites design their home pages to one or more specific types of visitors. For
bitcoin, I think visitors are likely to be:  
  
1\. Geeks who are interested in "how is bitcoin supposed to work."  
  
2\. Geeks who are interested in "how can I use bitcoin for a project I'm
thinking of working on."  
  
3\. Non-geeks who are interested in "what the heck is bitcoin and why should I
care."  
  
There are also several audiences I don't think bitcoin.org should target (for
example, people hoping that bitcoin is a way to get rich quick). Am I missing
anybody?  
  
I've been busy putting together a 5-minute talk for audience number 3; I think
I can re-purpose some of what I wrote for the website.
