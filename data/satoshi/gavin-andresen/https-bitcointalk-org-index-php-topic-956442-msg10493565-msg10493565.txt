Interesting idea, but I'm afraid I disagree with your premise.  
  
There is no tragedy-of-the-commons race to zero transaction fees, because
miners do not have infinite bandwidth, memory or CPU to accept and validate
transactions.  
  
We used to have a tragedy-of-the-commons situation with zero-fee transactions,
but we solved that by rate-limiting them based on priority. And we have a
working market for zero-fee transactions (see the graph here).  
  
Assuming network bandwidth is the eventual bottleneck, and assuming there is
demand for transactions to fill the available network-wide bandwidth (even if
that demand is transaction spammers), nodes will start dropping transactions
before they relay them. Prioritizing them based on fee paid and dropping the
lowest fee/kb transactions will result naturally in a working market for fee-
paying transactions.  
  
As justusranvier points out, off-the-blockchain deals between transaction
creators and miners doesn't change that logic, because low-fee transactions
that are not broadcast break the O(1) block propagation assumption and have a
direct cost to the miner.  
  
  
I think you are trying to solve a different problem: I think you are trying to
ensure that "enough" fees are paid to secure the network as the block subsidy
goes away. Yes?
