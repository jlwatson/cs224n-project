See this thread for BIP16-compatible-backported release candidates:

A final 0.6 release candidate will be out very soon, the last issues are being
resolved now.  
  
Again: if you don't upgrade and are a solo miner, pool operator, or p2pool
user you will **almost certainly waste time hashing bad blocks** after April
1.
