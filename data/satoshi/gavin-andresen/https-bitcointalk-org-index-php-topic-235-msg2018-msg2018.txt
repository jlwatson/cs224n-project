The "scripting language" ("expression evaluator" would be more accurate) is a
little stack-based intepreter that looks at lot like Forth.  
  
So, for example, here's an example of a GENERATED coin getting spent:  
  
TxIn: 73:3046...0f01  
Prev.TxOut: 65:046d...bb9c CHECKSIG  
  
That's intepreted as:  
PUSH a 73 byte value onto the stack  
PUSH a 65 byte value onto the stack  
call CHECKSIG. CHECKSIG pops two values off the stack (public key and digital
signature), then does the digital signature thing using the OpenSSL
ECDSA_Verify() function.
