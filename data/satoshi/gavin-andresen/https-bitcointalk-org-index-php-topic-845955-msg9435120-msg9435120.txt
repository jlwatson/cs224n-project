OP does have a point, Satoshi did walk away the moment Gavin accepted the
invitation to speak with the CIA. Coincidence?  

  
YES THAT WAS TOTALLY AND COMPLEETLY A COINCEDENCE!!!! HE WUZ PLANNING ON
LEAVING WAY BEFORE THAT!  
  
I THINK THE OP IS RIGHT, SO I'M GONNA MOVE THE SOURCE CODE TO SUMPLACE MORE
SECURE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T SEE IT ANYMORE. AND I WENT AND GOT ME A GOOD
HAT TO WEAR WHEN I WRITE CODE SO THEIR SATELITES CANT HEAR ME EITHER.  
  
FOR THE CHILDREN!
