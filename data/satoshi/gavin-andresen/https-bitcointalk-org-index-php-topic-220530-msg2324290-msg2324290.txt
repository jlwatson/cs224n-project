 **Currency generation** is a collaborative effort between n-client nodes and
a hatching node. Each node in the system will cast a vote to a random hatching
node to whether to create a currency unit (EMU).  

  
How do you prevent Sybil attacks-- somebody creating a gazillion n-client
and/or hatching nodes, and voting themselves lots and lots of new currency?  
  
And how does a node choose a "random" node-- does every node know about every
other node? If yes, then how do you avoid getting O(N^2) communication as the
number of nodes (N) rises and every existing node must be told about every new
node?
