I wrote a blog post about peak oil a couple of years ago:

really.html  
  
I still believe my conclusion: we'll be fine. We'll use less oil and more of
something else. After all we survived Peak Whale Oil (you know, whale oil,
that essential commodity that was so great for high-tech oil lanterns).
