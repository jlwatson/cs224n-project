Potential questions for the FAQ; these are all questions I wish I had insisted
on getting answered before trusting MyBitcoin with some of my coins:  
  
Are the bitcoins on deposit bonded or insured against theft or loss?  
  
Are the bitcoins on deposit backed up off-site? How often?  
  
How many people have access to the wallet? How do you know you can trust them,
or how are they audited?  
  
What happens if you decide Vibanko is not a viable business and has to be shut
down?
