What kind of scope is there for managing address/wallet creation?  

  
If you're willing to muck with the transaction processing code, you could only
allow transactions to addresses that have been created and blessed by the
Central Authority. You'd have to also teach the wallet code not to create lots
of addresses, but if you're going to require users to register and not be
anonymous you might as well centrally create and issue them their wallets.  
  
You then need a mechanism to broadcast new, blessed public keys to the entire
network, but that might be as simple as generating a transaction from a baked-
in blessed address (owed by the Central Authority) to the newly created
blessed address.  
  
Implementing and debugging would be a lot of work, and I'd be nervous about
neglecting some little detail and leaving the system open to hacks (Bitcoin is
nice because so many people are extremely motivated to find any chink in the
system and either exploit it or patch it-- a small complementary currency
wouldn't have that advantage). But it could be done.
