  
Simplest way:  
  
Call getaccountaddress "charity_name" when you generate the web page. You'll
get the same address over and over, until somebody donates. Then you'll get a
new address.  
  
Then periodically call:  
getbalance "charity_name"  
... and if the balance is greater than zero, call:  
sendfrom "charity_name" charity_real_bitcoin_address amount  
  
... to send the charity the accumulated coins.  
  
If you deal with several charities this way, AND you're bundling up several
donations before forwarding the coins to the charity, then it'll be hard to
connect donors to particular charities.
