So....  
  
I want to register a new domain name "gavin.bitdns" in this hypothetical
bitdns system.  
  
How do I do it? Run a BitX miner and hope that I generate a block sometime in
the next week or three? Ummm... yuck!  
  
Or I want to buy a domain from somebody; what does that look like in the
bitdns system?
