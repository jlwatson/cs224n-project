This modifies FormatMoney to display full-precision values (with trailing
zeroes trimmed correctly-- e.g. 0 is 0.00 but 0.00010000 displays as 0.0001).  
  
And ParseMoney allows entry of full-precision values.  
  
And JSON's AmountFromValue doesn't round to two places, so you can send/move
full-precision values.  
  
I haven't tested this with the GUI bitcoin yet, it will probably require UI
layout tweaks.
