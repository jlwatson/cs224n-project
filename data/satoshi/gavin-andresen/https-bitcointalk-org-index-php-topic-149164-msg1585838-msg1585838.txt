I wouldn't say NO progress is being made, but there has been a long detour
because we need a secure way of telling you WHO you are paying to make
multisignature work securely. Otherwise we could have the most nifty, secure
multisig system in the world that fails because you THINK you're paying
1kqHKEYYC8CQPxyV53nCju4Lk2ufpQqA2 but a crafty attacker makes you pay them at
1kqHLFyZDBDoPDYwSEtjv5CWka42uGqA2 instead.  
  
So I've been spending most of my time implementing "the payment protocol."
I'll write more in a Foundation blog post on Friday.  
  
Payment protocol messages will be part of the information that will be sent
between devices or people to make multisig transactions work.
