No, you probably won't get a response there, either.  
  
"All BIPs should" ... is too rigid, in my humble opinion.  
  
If the person championing the BIP thinks that a link to a discussion thread
helps clarify or convince, then they should include a link. But I don't think
a hard-and-fast rule is the right thing to do, we'll just waste time arguing
over WHICH discussion thread or threads should be linked...
