A better question might be: what would make me trust something like your
BitDollars?  
  
If you were bonded or insured for all of the bitcoins that you held, by a bank
or insurance company or people I trusted (and were audited by that bank or
insurance company or people to see how many bitcoins you were holding on
behalf of other people), that might get me to trust you with real bitcoins.
