I think sipa is right-- it will just look like a weird double-spend.  
  
Probably a good idea to reject transactions with non-canonical signatures
(reject if encode(decode(tx)) != tx ).  
  
I assume the DER-encoded ASN.1 octet representation is the same between
different ECDSA implementations (so if a non-openssl-based implementation
creates transactions its transactions would be accepted), is that a good
assumption?
