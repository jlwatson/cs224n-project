This definitely needs fixing; it is another "people getting lots of very small
change from mining pools" issue.  
  
The code that controls this is CTransaction::GetMinFee() in main.h and
CreateNewBlock() in main.cpp.  
  
We should think about:  
  
\+ Is setting aside a specific amount of space for free transactions the right
thing to do? Maybe blocks should just get filled in reverse priority order
(with transactions with fees at the front of the line)  
  
\+ What to do with the current transaction backlog.  
If old, big, low-priority transactions get flushed, then there needs to be
some way for the bitcoin client(s) that sent them to reclaim those coins.
Perhaps the client should stop retransmitting, and reclaim, transactions if,
oh, 5,000 blocks go by without the transaction getting accepted.  
  
Or maybe it makes sense to let those old transactions trickle in; perhaps the
next version of bitcoin should take the oldest transaction in the memory cache
and add it to the generated block.
