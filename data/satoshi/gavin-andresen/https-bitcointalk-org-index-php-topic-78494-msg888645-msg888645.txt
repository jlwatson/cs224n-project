On restart, you should be able to ask bitcoind for the top-of-chain block
(using getblockcount/getblockhash/getblock).  
  
If it's not in your database, then add it. Then look at the previous block
hash, and if it's not in your database ask bitcoind for it (and so on).  
  
To be extra safe, after you're all done ask bitcoind for the top-of-chain
block again to see if there was a block re-org while you were catching up.
