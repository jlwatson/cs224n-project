You are making the classic error economists call ‘confusing stock with flow’.

Bitcoin miners are competing to create the initial stock of 21million coins, using lots of electricity. Just like gold miners spend lots of energy digging and refining gold.

But once created, transaction costs (the ‘flow’) could be tiny— the same fraction of a bitcoin (or gold coin) can be traded over and over again without paying the initial cost that went in to its creation.
