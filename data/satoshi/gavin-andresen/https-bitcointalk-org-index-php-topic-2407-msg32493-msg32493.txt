A blockchain index? Doesn't the vanilla client index the blockchain for itself
already?  

  
Yes, that is exactly what the blkindex.dat file is.  
  
wallet.dat contains "extended dance mix" versions of all the transactions you
care about (all of "your" receives/sends). Those are loaded into memory at
startup (and then kept up-to-date as new transactions are seen), so
calculating "your" balance is quick (just scan through all wallet transactions
in memory and total them up).
