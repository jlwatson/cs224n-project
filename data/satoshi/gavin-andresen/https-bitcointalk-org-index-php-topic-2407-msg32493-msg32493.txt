  
Yes, that is exactly what the blkindex.dat file is.  
  
wallet.dat contains "extended dance mix" versions of all the transactions you
care about (all of "your" receives/sends). Those are loaded into memory at
startup (and then kept up-to-date as new transactions are seen), so
calculating "your" balance is quick (just scan through all wallet transactions
in memory and total them up).
