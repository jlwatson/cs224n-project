I do not see any point in moving the discussion of _some_ bitcoin changes to a
special place outside the forum. Discuss changes on the forum just like we've
always done, regardless of whether that change is a proposal, a patch, or a
pull request.  
  
The forum is perfectly adequate for discussions.  

  
OK. Lets talk here.
