i am nearly convinced now that a big block size together with 1BLT is a threat
for bitcoin as miners dont have any incentive to make smaller blocks.  

  
Why do you want miners to have an incentive to make smaller blocks?  
  
Smaller blocks means fewer transactions, so fewer opportunities to collect
fees, so less profit.  
  
Miner profit in fiat currency = number of transactions * average transaction
fee * btc-to-fiat exchange rate  
  
Experience (and common sense) says that more usage of Bitcoin means a higher
btc-to-fiat exchange rate, so if you want to maximize miner's fee revenue then
increasing the number of transactions is the obvious way to do it.  
  
If you think that putting an artificial cap on the number of transactions will
increase overall miner profit, then I urge you to find a Real Economist and
talk to them about the wisdom of trying to use production quotas to keep
prices artificially high.
