I'm a "bleeding heart libertarian." When I was young and naive I was
"progressive/liberal," but now that I'm old and wise (or maybe just more
cynical) I have a much greater respect for the positive incentives built-in to
private markets, and the negative incentives built-in to government.  
  
So I'm very sympathetic to the "it isn't fair that people with the
fastest/most GPUs generate more bitcoins" point of view.  
  
I agree that it would be more fair if every person started with an equal
number of bitcoins. Work harder than average or provide a service that people
value and you'd end up with more than you started with. Otherwise, you'd get
bitcoin poor.  
  
But I don't see a way to do that without some central authority deciding who
is, and who is not, a 'person'. And I'm old and cynical enough to think that
if there WAS a central authority making that decision, that central authority
would very quickly devolve into a corrupt, favor-granting, power-grabbing
institution.  
  
"Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Andresen, for the Good of the System we are delaying the
granting of your second child's Bitcoin Bounty until they have completed the
mandatory consumer education classes, registered to vote, and have completed
the voluntary 250 hours of America Freedom:Works! projects that they were
assigned."  
  
If you've got a brilliant, fool-proof, decentralized way of solving the
identity problem, speak up! That'd be an even bigger breakthrough than
bitcoin.
