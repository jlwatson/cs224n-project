I'm not familiar enough with Satoshi client internals to easily understand
what script_tests is doing. Could you confirm my understanding of the format
of the two JSON files?  

  
The format is a list of pairs, where the first item is the scriptSig required
to spend and the second is the scriptPubKey. The third item is ignored (useful
for comments).  
  
script_valid.json contains only valid scriptSig/scriptPubKey pairs.  
script_invalid.json contains only invalid scriptSig/scriptPubKey pairs.  
  
valid/invalid are defined by the rules of transaction validation, and the unit
test actually constructs transactions and runs the verification routine on
them to make sure that they succeed or fail, as expected.
