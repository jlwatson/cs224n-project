I really and truly hope you're, right, MPOE.  
  
But I would give 4-to-1 odds that the US justice system will disagree, and my
advice to anybody thinking of raising funds via an unregulated IPO would be
"don't do it unless you want to do it as a protest against our broken system
and are willing to face the likely consequences."  
  
I'll cheer you from the sidelines, but I'm either not stupid enough or not
brave enough to go up against the SEC.
