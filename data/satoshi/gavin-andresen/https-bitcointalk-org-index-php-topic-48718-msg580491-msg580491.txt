Good luck keeping your account open without a FinCEN ruling excluding you from
liabilities regarding reporting the personal information of depositors...  

  
Double-huh? You write your Mt.Gox account information on the deposit, Mt.Gox
has all the information necessary to report to FinCen (because only upgraded
Mt.Gox accounts can use the service) if required (if depositing more than
whatever the daily/weekly FinCen requirements are, yada yada...).  
  
What's up with the attitude Matthew? More ways to purchase bitcoin is a good
thing...
