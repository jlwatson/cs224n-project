Split from the press hits topic:  
  
The only "skeleton key" I have is the private key for alert messages, that
lets me sign messages that are broadcast and then displayed in the client (see
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Alerts for details, and the alerts that have been
sent).  
  
MAYBE he is saying that the core developers could slip in a change to the
source code without anybody else noticing... but we've worked hard to make
that impossible (with things like the gitian reproducible build system so
people can verify that we are creating executables from the source code that
anybody can look at).  
  
Smells like plain-old FUD to me.
