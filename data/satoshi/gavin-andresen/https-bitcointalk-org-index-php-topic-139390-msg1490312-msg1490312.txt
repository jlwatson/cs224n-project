Okey dokey, first I think **nobody should use an easy-to-memorize
brainwallet** for anything more than experimenting. I predict we'll start
seeing very unhappy brainwallet users reporting huge losses sooner or later.  
  
Second: the 'sentinel wallet' idea is all about incentives.  
  
You need to put enough BTC in the sentinel wallet so it is economically
rational for an attacker to "take the money and run" rather than spend time
and money trying to crack a bigger brainwallet that might not even exist.  
  
Again, I don't think you should use a brainwallet, so I'm not motivated to do
the math to figure out how many BTC you should put into the sentinel wallet so
a ration attacker will just take it, but that is the way you should think
about it.
