Why so long?  

Because the wallet is massive  

  
... and because bitcoind's wallet code hasn't been optimized for massive
wallets. "patches welcome"  
(although I think the wallet code needs a complete rewrite, we've learned a
lot over the last couple of years and need wallets that are much easier to
back up and keep secure).
