  
... and that's exactly why I discourage people from doing things like that. It
is too easy for two "copies" of a wallet to get out-of-sync.  
  
You have to be a geek and muck around with copying the wallet.dat file from
one place to another to get into trouble, and that is by design. I have no
problem at all with geeky tools that let you do dangerous things (like
PyWallet).  
  
The JSON-RPC interface is trickier, because adding dangerous functionality
there might encourage web services to do not-so-smart things like sending
private keys over unencrypted/unprotected channels ("Email the private key as
a Christmas gift" works great for a while, and then the bad guys start looking
for privkeys in traffic they're sniffing and spend them before your Dad
can....)
