Shouldn't we all push for decentralized pools, like P2Pool ?  

  
Yes.  
  
I'd love so see a bitcoin client with p2pool-technology built in; bring back
the "generate coins" option!  
  
But... that will take a while. If I was a pool operator, though, I'd be
thinking about other bitcoin-related businesses where I could use my expertise
(the pool operators deserve a lot of credit, they've had to deal with DOS
attacks, keeping their wallets safe, servicing hundreds or thousands of
customers banging on their servers constantly, etc).
