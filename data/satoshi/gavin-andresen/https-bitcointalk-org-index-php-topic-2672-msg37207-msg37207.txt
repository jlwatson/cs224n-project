I think this needs to be explicitly allowed from the bitcoin client side,
otherwise any website could start quietly bruteforcing the username/password
out of a client.

  
If you've opened up access to the rpcport, then I don't think CORS support
adds any significant vulnerability to password brute-forcing. I suppose it
means a 10-year-old non-programmer can repeatedly enter a username and
password into a website to try to brute-force your rpcpassword... but anybody
capable of writing or running a script could just write a brute-forcer that
doesn't run in a browser.  
  
And, come to think of it, turning on CORS explicitly wouldn't stop the ten-
year-old, either: they could just repeatedly browse to URL http://your-
bitcoind-machine:8332/ and try different usernames/passwords.  
  
Also, bitcoind already has anti-brute-forcing code.  
  
The only security vulnerability I could imagine with CORS is that it might
encourage people to add:  
rpcallowip=*  
... to their bitcoin.conf, so they can connect to bitcoin from any IP address.
And I worry that they might not bother to setup SSL, in which case their rpc
username/password will be sent across the net in the clear.
