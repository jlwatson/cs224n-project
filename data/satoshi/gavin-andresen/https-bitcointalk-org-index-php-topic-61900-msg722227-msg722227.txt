So the SolidCoin folks have been creating 1-post locked threads announcing
stuff.  
  
Putting aside how you feel about SolidCoin, I wonder what other people think
about that practice in general. It seems to me to go against the purpose of
"Forums" -- seems to me the whole point is discussion. If you don't want
discussion, then buy an ad or publish information on your website.  
  
Seems to me locking threads should be a last resort instead of "I'll just lock
every thread I make to keep out the trolls."  
  
I'm going to lock this thread now because I think some people will disagree
with me.  
(KIDDING, JUST KIDDING)
