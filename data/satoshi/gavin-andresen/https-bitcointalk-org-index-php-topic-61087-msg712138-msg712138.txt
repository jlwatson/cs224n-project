So I'm trying to figure out why I'm so annoyed at I'm-sure-you-can-guess-who.  
  
And I think I've figured it out-- I think it is because I feel like I bend
over backwards to be completely honest and open about potential flaws or
problems with my ideas, and I'm completely honest and open about the fact that
I'm human and I make mistakes.  
  
And it seems like that's being leveraged to create fear, uncertainty and
doubt. I say something like "there is a small risk that...", but I NEVER EVER
hear even a hint that the "other side's" proposal might be anything but
perfect.  
  
Maybe I'm just too naive, and aught to get with the program and say that
everything I do comes perfect, straight from God. People do tend to suffer
from The Wise Leader Fallacy; maybe I should stop fighting against human
nature and be more of a politician.  
  
Ok, enough venting.
