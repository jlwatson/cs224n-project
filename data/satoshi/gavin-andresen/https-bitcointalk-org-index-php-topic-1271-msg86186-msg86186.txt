  
As of version 0.3.20, the GUI and JSON-RPC both allow full-precision values
for sends. So you can send 1.00123456 BTC if you like.  
  
And the GUI will display full-precision wallet balances/etc (it truncates
trailing zeros past .00, so you won't notice unless you have sub-cent BTC in
your wallet).  
  
The 'dust spam' rules are still in, so you're expected to pay a fee if you are
sending less than 0.01 BTC-- that is, if you try to send 0.00001 BTC it will
trigger the fee (sending 1.00001 would not trigger the fee).
