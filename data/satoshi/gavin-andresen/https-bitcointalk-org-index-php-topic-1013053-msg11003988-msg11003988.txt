Secretary work?  
  
Lindsay WAS the Foundation at the beginning, and did EVERYTHING (including
single-handedly organizing the San Jose conference).  
  
She, like me, got a huge salary boost because the Foundation's original policy
was to set the exchange rate for paying salaries once per quarter. That policy
changed pretty quickly (neither Lindsay or I had any influence on our own
salaries or the policies for how they were paid) to "use the CoinDesk price
index on payday."  
  
You have to remember that even simple things like "which exchange rate should
be used to pay employees" didn't have simple answers back then (nobody had
created a cross-exchange, volume-weighted price index).  
  
I believe she left the Foundation partly because of annoying misogynistic
Internet trolls like the ones found in this very thread....
