Is anybody else seeing anything like what jetmine is seeing? Anybody else
running CentOS 5.6? Did you compile from source or are you using the binaries
we compiled?  
  
My 0.6 nodes running on Ubuntu 11 have been rock solid.  
  
The "CBlock::ReadFromDisk() : OpenBlockFile failed" is very odd, that should
never happen. You aren't running with a -datadir on a network drive or
something are you?  
  
RE: filling addr.dat: that is one of the denial-of-service attacks fixed by
the 0.6 release.
