Ummm.... speaking of the hardfork, has a version of Litecoin been released yet
that fixes the problem?  

If it's a rhetorical question, that's OK.  
  
If not, I am worried.  

  
Not rhetorical: it needs to be fixed, or your blockchain can easily be forked.  
  
Beware of Altchains that are abandoned or neglected by their developers
(activity at https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/commits/master
doesn't look healthy to me... and now y'all are going to accuse me of
spreading FUD, so I'll go away and shut up).
