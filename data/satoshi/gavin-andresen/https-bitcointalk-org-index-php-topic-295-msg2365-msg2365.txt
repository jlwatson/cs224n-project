The Bitcoin Faucet is handling the slashdotting really well... except that I'm
running out of coins to give away. over 5,000 have flowed out of the Faucet
since I refilled it last night.  
  
Any of you early adopters who generated tens of thousands of coins back in the
early days, are you willing to send a few to the Faucet to be given away so
more people can try out Bitcoin? I know that most of them are likely to be
lost (I suspect there a lot of slashdot lookey-loos who won't stick around
long enough to spend their 5 bitcoins), but if that's the case then that'll
just increase the value of your other bitcoins, anyway...  
  
Fountain donation address is: ~~15VjRaDX9zpbA8LVnbrCAFzrVzN7ixHNsC~~  
  
Depending on donations and how long the slashdotting lasts, I might have to
start giving away bitnickels...
