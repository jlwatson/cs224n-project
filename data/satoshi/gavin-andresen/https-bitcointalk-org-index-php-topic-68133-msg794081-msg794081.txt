Stay tuned: the testnet is a mess right now. Another genesis block reset might
be needed to fix it, there have been several blockchain-splitting changes and
there are several different versions of the blockchain competing (with/without
the difficulty change, with/without the duplicate coinbase change, and
with/without BIP16 support).  
  
In the meantime, testing with a testnet-in-a-box or private testnet is a good
way to go:
