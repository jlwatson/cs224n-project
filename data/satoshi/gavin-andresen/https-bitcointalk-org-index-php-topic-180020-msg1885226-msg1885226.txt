Howdy Adam!  
  
I'm going to quote myself, this is from an email I wrote yesterday to somebody
else concerned about chip/mining centralization:  
  
In the very long run, mining will be dominated by your cost of electricity and
your ability to put the excess heat generated to good use.  
  
I don't think it will matter what algorithm is used or even if the algorithm
was changed every six months; if a general-purpose CPU was the only thing you
could use for mining, you might see general-purpose CPUs designed to operate
at thousands of degrees celsius being designed so that aluminum smelting
plants can also mine bitcoins with all that electricity they use turning
bauxite into aluminum.  
  
In the short run... I think there is zero chance that "we" will decide to
change the hashing algorithm.
