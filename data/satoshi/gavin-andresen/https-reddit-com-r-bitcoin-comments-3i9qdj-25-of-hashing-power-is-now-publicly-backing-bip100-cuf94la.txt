You're wrong in two different ways:

1) Current p2p message size limit is 2MB (it was changed a couple releases ago).

2) My implementation of BIP101 keeps the limit for all messages except for 'block' -- those messages are limited to whatever the current maximum block size possible is (given current time and network rules about how accurate clocks must be).

Please, this debate is noisy enough, don't spread misinformation.
