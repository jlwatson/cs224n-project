A serious bug was been found in the "encrypt wallet" function of bitcoin
versions 0.4 and 0.5: private keys may be left unencrypted in the wallet.dat
file after encryption.  
  
If your encrypted 0.4 wallet file is stolen, an attacker may be able to
recover some or all of your private keys and steal some or all of your
bitcoins.  
  
The development team has been working on fixes for bitcoin versions 0.4 and
0.5, but it will take at least a few days to test them thoroughly. Until they
are available, you should assume that your 'encrypted' wallets are as
vulnerable as an unencrypted wallet, and follow all the best practices for
keeping them safe (see here for a list).  
  
It is embarrassing and astonishing that this critical a bug was not caught
before the 0.4 release; constructive suggestions on how to improve the testing
and release processes that do not assume access to hundreds of thousands of
dollars of funds to hire security consultants or QA teams are welcome. Getting
sufficient testing of code BEFORE it is released has been a chronic problem
for this project.
