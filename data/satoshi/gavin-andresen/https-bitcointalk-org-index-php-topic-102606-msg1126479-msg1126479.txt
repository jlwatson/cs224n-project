EITHER: requiring that the wallet be unlocked for the settxfee RPC call to
succeed  
OR: adding a new configuration option "-maxtxfee" (default: 0.01 maybe) that
can't be set via RPC  
... seems reasonable to me.  
  
We've had an implicit assumption that if an attacker gets access to the RPC
interface you're sunk, and while I think that's true (attacker could run a
tight loop of "sendtoaddress" that will fail until the moment you unlock the
wallet to send some bitcoins somewhere), I also think security in depth is a
good idea.  
  
Can you open an issue on github please?  
  
RE: gui not telling you about the fee:  
  
Can you open a separate issue on github about that, too? That's just a bug, in
my humble opinion.
