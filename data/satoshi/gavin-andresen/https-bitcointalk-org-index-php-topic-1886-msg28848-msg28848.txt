What exactly is the difference between move and sendfrom? Is it just shorthand
for getting the account address and sending the coins to it? How does a moved
coin act in the block chain?  

  
moves do not touch the block chain, they add accounting entries to your wallet
to adjust the balances of the accounts involved.
