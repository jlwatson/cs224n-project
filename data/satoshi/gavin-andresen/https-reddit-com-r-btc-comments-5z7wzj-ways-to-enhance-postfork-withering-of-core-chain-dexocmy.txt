Physically harming others without their consent is immoral.

If you freely agree to participate in a system where the rules are clear, and somebody finds a way to take advantage of you by creatively applying the rules... especially if you know in advance that somebody COULD take advantage of you...

I dunno; borderline immoral at best. I thought the ETH folks made the wrong decision on the DAO hack fork, but they went with 'rules weren't clear and stealing is immoral.'
