  
Those are "Proposal 1" -- enabling all the 'plain-old' OP_CHECKMULTISIG
transactions.  
  
groffer reports finding a bug in CHECKMULTISIG (pops too many items off the
stack), which makes me wonder if it would be better to avoid it. For small n,
using CHECKSIG multiple times is straightforward and doesn't make the
transactions much larger.  
  
The (a and b) OR c transaction with public keys instead of addresses isn't in
the proposal, but for consistency's sake I agree it should be.
