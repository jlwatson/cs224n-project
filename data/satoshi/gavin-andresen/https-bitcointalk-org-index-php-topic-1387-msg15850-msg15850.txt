That's what I thought... just wanted to make sure before I started. davidonpda
is 10 and will probably never get there haha!  

  
But if it supported regular expressions "david.*on.*pda" would probably be
found in a reasonable amount of time...  
  
Of course, if you were unlucky it'd find something like
1davidSpoonLApdaDDY13iu8 (not a real bitcoin address)
