I would be trivial to add a JSON-RPC command to do that. Just use the
IsValidBitcoinAddress function.  

  
For extra credit, give an Object as the return value:  
  
{  
'isvalid' : true,  
'ismine' : true, # true if isvalid and you have the private key (can spend
coins sent to this address)  
'version' : 0, # ADDRESSVERSION  
'address' : '1frt6531....' # might as well echo back the address...  
}
