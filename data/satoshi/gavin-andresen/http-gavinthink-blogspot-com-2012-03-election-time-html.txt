All two-hundred-and-forty Amherst Town Meeting seats are up for re-election
this year; I'm one of 41 candidates running for election in Precinct 9 (the
top 24! vote-getters will be elected).  
  
Yes, it **is** kind of a crazy way to run a Town; I've never bothered to see
if there's been any serious research into whether the form of Town government
actually makes a difference to their success. I suppose even defining
"success" would be hard; New York City is arguably the most successful US
city, but I wouldn't live there if you paid me to.  
  
If you're an Amherst voter, go to the Sustainable Amherst website, print out
their handy 2012 election guide, and then go vote on Tuesday.
