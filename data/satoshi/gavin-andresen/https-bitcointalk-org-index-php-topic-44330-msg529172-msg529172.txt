RE: cannot act as a RPC client:  
  
I believe it will still be able to act as a RPC server.  
  
So you can run the GUI with the -server switch, but you'll have to talk to it
using (for example)  
bitcoind getinfo  
  
... as opposed to today, where you can run "bitcoin -server" to get the GUI
and then run "bitcoin getinfo" to talk to the running GUI process.  
  
RE: why switch: because no wxwidgets programmers stepped up and made it
better. And from what I can see, QT is more popular and supported (so there
are more programmers able and willing to help improve).  
  
RE: screen shots: See the bitcoin-qt thread in the Alternative Clients sub-
forum here.
