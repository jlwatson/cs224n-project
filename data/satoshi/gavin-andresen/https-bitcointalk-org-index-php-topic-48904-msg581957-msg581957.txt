Example possible BIPs:  
  
URL syntax for bitcoin payments  
  
New OP_EVAL scripting opcode for receiver-specifies-transaction  
  
New bitcoin address format to support OP_EVAL  
  
(I'm actually working on those two)  
  
  
Informational:  
  
Process for announcing/scheduling/implementing a potentially block-chain-
splitting change.

You can browse through the PEP's at http://www.python.org/dev/peps/ to get
some idea of the kinds of things that might be good BIPs; changes to the on-
the-wire protocol to make blockchain downloads faster would certainly be
appropriate.
