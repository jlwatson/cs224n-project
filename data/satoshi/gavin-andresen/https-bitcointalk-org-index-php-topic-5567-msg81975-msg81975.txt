As that aspect of Bitcoin severely limits it's "world currency status"
potential.  

  
Huh. One-to-three **day** transfer times doesn't seem to have hurt the dollar
much: http://www.depositaccounts.com/blog/inside-look-at-ach-transfer-speeds-

"Instant" payments with world currencies is an illusion created by your bank
of financial institution based on how much they trust the person or
institution sending the money. There is nothing stopping bitcoin financial
institutions from using the same trick, and I think as the bitcoin economy
grows and companies start to trust each other instant transfer times will
happen.
