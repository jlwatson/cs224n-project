My preferred arrangement would be a 'monitorall' command...  

Good Idea, and that aught to be easy.  
  
I'm thinking it should be:  
monitoraddress allwallet <url>  
... instead of a separate monitor command.  
  
Come to think of it, maybe I should combine the getblockby* routines into one;
there's no chance of mistaking a 64-character hex block hash for a 5-digit
(or, in many years, a six or seven or ten digit) block number.
