The problem is, the bitcoin client SUCKS. It sucked 6 months ago, it sucks
even more today with version 5 (congratulations, you managed to make it
suckier... the impossible made possible)  

  
If I thought that downloading and installing software onto your computer is
the way to go then I'd be helping make it better.  
  
I don't. I think 90-something-percent of future Bitcoin users will be using it
on an iPad or mobile phone or on their computer in a web browser.  
  
I'm sorry you think 0.5 is worse than 0.4, but you're in the (vocal) minority.
Nobody stepped up to support the 0.4 wxWidgets-based GUI, and we've got
several people working on the 0.5 Qt-based GUI, so I'm confident switching was
the right decision.
