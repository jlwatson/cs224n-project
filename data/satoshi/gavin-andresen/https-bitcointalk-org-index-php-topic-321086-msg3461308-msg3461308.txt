The wealth is not in the "printed money" you are missing the point. The wealth
is in the company that invests its time in the coin, and the people that will
work for the coin.  

  
Mmm. Maybe.  
  
That sounds a lot like the alternative local currency movement-- create a
local currency that somehow expresses the local community's values.  
  
I'm probably just a too-logical, cold-hearted geek, but building community
around a currency doesn't strike a chord with me. To me, community is about
people, and a currency is just a tool for transactions. I guess an analogy
would be a bunch of carpenters who build a community around some Extra Special
brand of nails that they create and trade amongst themselves.
