  
Mmm. Maybe.  
  
That sounds a lot like the alternative local currency movement-- create a
local currency that somehow expresses the local community's values.  
  
I'm probably just a too-logical, cold-hearted geek, but building community
around a currency doesn't strike a chord with me. To me, community is about
people, and a currency is just a tool for transactions. I guess an analogy
would be a bunch of carpenters who build a community around some Extra Special
brand of nails that they create and trade amongst themselves.
