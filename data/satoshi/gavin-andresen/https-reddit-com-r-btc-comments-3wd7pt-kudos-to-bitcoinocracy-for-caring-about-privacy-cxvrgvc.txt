No-- lots of people choose to trust others to hold their coins, or split trust (with multisig-locked coins). Or they put them in inaccessible cold storage.

So lots of coin holders would be left out.

And there are major 'stakeholders' who have invested a lot who's stake is not in the form of coins-- miners being the most obvious example (startups being another).
