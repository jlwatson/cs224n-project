Starting with OWASP is good advice.  
  
But if you are holding other people's bitcoins, just securing the app is not
enough. You need people who have experience securing **money** telling you how
to create processes to make sure you're not the victim of embezzlement, that
you are complying with legal requirements, keeping adequate records, keeping
customers' funds separate from the funds used to pay expenses, that regular
audits are done to detect problems early, and so on.

The Bitcoin Protocol is innovative but financial institutions on the other
hand have been around for a very long time.
