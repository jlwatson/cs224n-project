The attack sould last 1h, spending those 400 BTC for 80 times instead of just

You can't spend 400 BTC 80 times in 1 hour. If you control a majority of the
generation you could spend them twice an an hour (assuming merchants require 6

So you need to divide your expected profit per hour by 40, making your ROI
very, very negative.
