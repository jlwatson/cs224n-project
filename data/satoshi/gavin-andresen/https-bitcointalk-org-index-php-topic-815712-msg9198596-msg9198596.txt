  
That does not address the core of people's fears, which is that big,
centralized mining concerns will collaborate to push smaller competitors off
the network by driving up the median block size.  
  
  
Yes, that is a good point, made by other people in the other thread about
this. A more conservative rule would be fine with me, e.g.  
  
Fact: average "good" home Internet connection is 250GB/month bandwidth.  
Fact: Internet bandwidth has been growing at 50% per year for the last 20
years.  
(if you can find better data than me on these, please post links).  
  
So I propose the maximum block size be increased to 20MB as soon as we can be
sure the reference implementation code can handle blocks that large (that
works out to about 40% of 250GB per month).  
Increase the maximum by 40% every two years (really, double every two years--
thanks to whoever pointed out 40% per year is 96% over two years)  
Since nothing can grow forever, stop doubling after 20 years.
