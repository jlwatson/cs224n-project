This is a single-line change that allows non-standard transactions to get into
the transaction memory pool (and, therefore, relayed and written into blocks)
on -testnet.  
  
Satoshi suggested this to me in an email a few weeks ago, and I agree it is a
good idea-- we should encourage people to experiment on -testnet with new
features, or they will figure out less efficient ways of wedging what they
want to do into the existing standard transaction types.
