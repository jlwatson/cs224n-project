On further testing, it looks like OSX and Linux payment protocol requests with
the released 0.9.0 binaries are not vulnerable.  
  
The released Windows 0.9.0 binaries are vulnerable, so Wladimir just sent an
alert message urging everybody running 0.9.0 to upgrade.  
  
Check again; see the use of CKeyingMaterial/CPrivKey which uses a
secure_allocator (which asks the operating system not to swap the memory to
disk, and which zeros memory on free). If I recall correctly, the RPC
importprivkey should be the only place where the normal memory allocator is
used (the keys exist as ordinary hex strings in memory before they are
processed by the importprivkey code).  
  
Careful review (and testing and patches) is always welcome, of course. You
shouldn't trust my famously faulty memory.
