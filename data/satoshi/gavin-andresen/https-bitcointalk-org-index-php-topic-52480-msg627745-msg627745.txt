Hm, I just downloaded the .zip version and noticed that the sha1sum doesn't
match:  
What's up?  

  
I updated the .zip and .tar.gz and SHASUMS.asc a few hours ago, because the
.zip and the .tar.gz were expanding to a "bitcoin-rc7" directory.

I'm confused, the file says "bitcoin-0.5.0-win32-setup.exe" but the GUI looks
the same and in the version number inside the client it says  
version 0.4.0-Beta.  

  
Be sure you run bitcoin-qt.exe, not the old bitcoin.exe.
