Since Mike laid out the advantages of moving to DNSSEC for the PKI as soon as
possible (in the other thread), an SSL "hack" may just be what we need for
know, rather than designing anything "serious" based on SSL which is then
later discarded. I like this hack and don't see any problem with it. Bitcoin
pubkeys can be encoded case-insensitive in base32. And the merchant can decide
if the security benefit is worth it for him or not. Small merchants won't have
that kind of monitoring.  

  
I'm liking the hack the more I think about it, too. Encoding a compressed
public key (257 bits) in base32 would be 52 characters, which is comfortably
less than the 63-character domain name limit.  
  
Anybody buying a multi-domain (not wildcard) certificate sometime soon? I'm
curious to find out if CA's blink if you ask them to issue a certificate valid
for something like
