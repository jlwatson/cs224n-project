Kinda mostly reasonable... but why is https://github.com/saracen in the list? That's a handle I don't recognize.

The tricky bit is somebody like gmaxwell, who doesn't write a lot of code but does a LOT of code review and contributes in lots of other ways.

The other tricky bit is we've had other "pay for github activity" tools, and

a) they are not a significant source of funds for developers
b) it is really easy to incentivize bad behavior (like making lots of trivial changes)

I'm all for experiments for how to reward people doing good work, but I'm not optimistic that ANY radically decentralized model can replace the tried-and-true models for funding open source developers.
