The fees can be lowered if the price rises too high. They have already been
lowered several times for exactly this reason, and there's no reason to think
it won't happen again.  

  
Transaction fees are likely to go up (in dollar terms) for a while, until some
engineering work is done to reduce the "orphan cost" for miners to include
more transactions in their blocks **OR** mining pools / miners collectively
agree to include more transactions for the good of the whole system.  
  
In the very short term, you can ask mining pool operators to create larger
blocks. If they refuse, then switch your miners to a pool that does.  
  
If they all create larger blocks, then we get more transactions and more
orphan blocks, but the cost of those extra orphan blocks is spread across
everybody mining, so everybody gets just as many bitcoins (on average) as they
would with smaller blocks.
