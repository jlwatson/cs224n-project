Gavin, you should make it much more obvious about how to give back to the
Faucet. In the end I had to click to (try to) get another .05 BTC, at which
point it said I had already gotten some, but if I wanted to I could give back
to a specific address, which I assume is the Faucet. Is it ok to post it here
for confirmation?  

  
The Donate: address is hiding down at the bottom of the page:

... and I just updated my forum signature, too.
