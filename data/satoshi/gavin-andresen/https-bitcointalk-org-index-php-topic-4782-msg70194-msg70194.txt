RE: fractional reserve bitcoin banks:  
  
I think it will happen, too. Because of the nature of bitcoins they could
arrange so that their reserves can be audited by anybody (easiest way: prove
they own a particular bitcoin address by signing something with its private
key, then send all their reserves to that address).
