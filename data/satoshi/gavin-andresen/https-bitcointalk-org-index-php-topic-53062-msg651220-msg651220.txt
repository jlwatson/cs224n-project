The only way to convince MerkleWeb to calculate anything different is with
"choice bits" (as I wrote above), which are kind of like network ports mapped
into certain global 320-bit addresses. Each choice bit can only be written by
a certain private-key. Each group of choice bits has a public-key that
everyone can see to verify the digitally-signed bits from the private-key.  

  
Ok. So who controls the private keys?
