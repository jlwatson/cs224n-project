Designing and implementing user-friendly wallet backup for the GUI bitcoin
seems like it would be a great little project for somebody who knows C++ and
knows, or is willing to learn, wxWidgets programming. The non-GUI code already
has the 'backupwallet' RPC method, and 'getinfo' will tell you the age of the
oldest key in your keypool.  
  
For extra credit, the code could keep track of the last successful backup and
warn you that it is time to backup again when the keypool age gets close to
the last backup time.
