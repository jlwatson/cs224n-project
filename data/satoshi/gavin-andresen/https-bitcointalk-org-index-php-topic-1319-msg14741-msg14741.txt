I just updated the code/patch:  
monitoraddress allwallet <url>  
... gets triggered for all transactions that go into your wallet. That
includes 'change' transactions that can occur when you send somebody coins,
which I expect will strike some people as a bug and others as an important
feature.  
  
And I combined the getblockby methods into one. I know I would've never
remembered "is it getblockybycount or getblockbynumber or getblockbyheight or
getblockbydepth" -- I will remember "getblock".
