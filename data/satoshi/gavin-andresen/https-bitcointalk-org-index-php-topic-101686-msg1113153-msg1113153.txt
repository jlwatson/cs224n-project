From an email I sent to somebody concerned about bitcoin usability just a
couple of days ago:  
  
Making the reference Bitcoin application more usable isn't a high priority for
me right now.  
  
The high priority is making it safe to use, even if your computer gets
infected by malware. I **WANT** it to be hard and geeky to use so only geeks
who are able to keep their computers secure run it.  
  
Also, the "download and run software on my computer" way of doing things is
dying. The vast majority of ordinary users will be using Bitcoin on their
smart-phones or through a web browser in the near future....
