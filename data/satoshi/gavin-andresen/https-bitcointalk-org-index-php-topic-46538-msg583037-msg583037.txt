  
I pulled a Satoshi and decided to implement OP_EVAL to make sure it would
actually work.  
https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/tree/op_eval  
  
Not ready for pulling, expect rebasing/tweaking/changing. But it is fully
working on the testnet.  
(example transaction here)  
  
The code puts "OP_EVAL" in the coinbase of generated blocks, so the rest of
the network can see how many miners support it.  
  
I gathered contact information for the top ten mining pools last week; when
there is rough consensus on the details, I'll contact them to see if they have
concerns and/or are willing to support OP_EVAL.  
  
I started writing up BIPs for the various pieces of OP_EVAL, I'll post them
soon.
