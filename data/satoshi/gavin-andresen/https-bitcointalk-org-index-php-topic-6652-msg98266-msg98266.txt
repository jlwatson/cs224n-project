Doesn't Gavin already live on the east cost of the US? I thought he was only
originally from Australia.  

Yep, I live in Amherst, Massachusetts; my family moved to the US when I was 5
years old.  
  
I will be visiting Australia (Sydney for a couple of days then Tasmania for a
couple weeks then Cairns for a week or two) in July.
