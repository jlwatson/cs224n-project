It's fairly easy to manipulate actually; sybil attacks are not that hard to
do. (there's evidence they're being used against people accepting zeroconf) I
demonstrated a 1BTC fee tx due to the estimator failing. Right now there is a
cap of 100mBTC, but obviously that can drain your wallet pretty quickly.  

  
... demonstrated in a completely artificial -regtest environment...  
  
If you can Sybil somebody and control their view of the network, then it seems
to me there are more potentially profitable attacks than "make them pay more
in fees than they should."  
  
But please feel free to demonstrate an actual, effective Sybil on the fee
estimation code. bitcoincore.org is running a wallet-less bitcoind on port
8333 that generates the graphs at bitcoincore.org/smartfee/  
  
(hacking into the web server to make it LOOK like the fee estimation code
failed doesn't count, you have to manage to control it's p2p network
connections and then manipulate the memory pool).
