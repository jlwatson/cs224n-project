Okey dokey.  
  
Have you contributed any patches to p2pool to make it more efficient / easier
to install / etc? If not, why not if you're so worried about centralization?  
  
(honest question, I don't keep up with p2pool development because I'm
personally not terribly worried about mining centralization)
