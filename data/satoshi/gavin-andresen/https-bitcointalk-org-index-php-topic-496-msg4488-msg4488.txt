What happens in those few seconds if the coin was double spent? Are you
notified before the next block comes in?  

I'm not personally notified, no...  But if I have a Bitcoin client connected
to the network then yes, it (along with all the other connected clients)
should be sent every transaction shortly after they happen. It has to-- it
might be generating blocks, and the whole point of block generation is to
record the valid transactions the client has seen that haven't been included
in a previous block.  
  
There's a discussion in this thread of how likely it is that an attacker could
"split the network" to successfully double-spend coins.
