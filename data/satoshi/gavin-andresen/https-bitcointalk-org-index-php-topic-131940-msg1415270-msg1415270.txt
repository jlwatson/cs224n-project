We will accelerate the development schedule for this fix so stay tuned. I will
give an update in my weekly update later this week on the progress of the
release.  

There are several smart people here who would tell you if your fix will work
or not, if you listen to them.  
  
Peer review is not perfect, but is much better than assuming that you will
always come up with the best solution.
