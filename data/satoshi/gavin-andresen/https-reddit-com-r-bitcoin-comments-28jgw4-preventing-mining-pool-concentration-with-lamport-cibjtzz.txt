Plusses:

Lamport signatures are implemented via hashing.

Minuses:

Bitcoin ASIC hardware is insanely tuned to do the double-SHA256-hash of the 80-byte block header. Tweaking it to do Lamport signatures is probably a lot harder than we non-hardware-designers think (I doubt it'd be a firmware upgrade, but might be wrong, I'm not a hardware guy).

As other people point out: variance.
