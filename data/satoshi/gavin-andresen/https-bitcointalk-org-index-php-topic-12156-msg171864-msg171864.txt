I'm fairly on the fence of this, but I have to ask: What standard are we using
for BTC's enormous momentum? Its market price? The size of its goods and
services economy? The amount of processing power committed?  

I'm optimistic about bitcoin because of two metrics:  
  
1\. Lots of people are interested in it, all over the world.  
  
2\. There are lots of interesting, innovative projects being built around
bitcoin.  
  
It is still VERY early days, and I'll say it again: expect growing pains.
