  
I think the real danger is that a large mining operator would create a side
business selling space in their blocks for these types of intentional double-
spends. When they generate a block they could send a text message to a bunch
of people saying "try to spend NOW".  
  
I wonder if there's some way to discourage that kind of anti-social behavior;
could the network detect that was being done and "shun" that miner's blocks?
