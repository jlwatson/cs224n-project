Hmm, yeah, it's probably normal; I THOUGHT the default address was given an
empty label; I'm wrong, they're given the label "Your Address".  
So:

Code:

./bitcoind getaddressesbylabel "Your Address"

should work.  
  
Or just generate a new address, either with or without a label:  

Code:

./bitcoind getnewaddress
