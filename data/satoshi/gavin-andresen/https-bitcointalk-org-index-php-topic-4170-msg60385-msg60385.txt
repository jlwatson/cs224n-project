Crashing bugs, any bug that might result in loss of bitcoins, and security
fixes are always highest priority, but here are the big things I think are
very high priority that, as far as I know, nobody is working on. I think they
all need to be done before we can say we have a "Bitcoin 1.0" :  
  

  * finish download-only-blockheaders client mode
  * password-protect the wallet private keys (mitigate the steal wallet.dat problem: see https://gist.github.com/803170 )
  * import a backed-up wallet
  * figure out how to do click-to-pay
  * design/implement a secure DNS-like "map string to bitcoin address" system (so I can send bitcoins to "gavin@acm.org")
  * export+encrypt part of your balance (for long-term storage; I still waffle on whether we want to encourage that right now)
