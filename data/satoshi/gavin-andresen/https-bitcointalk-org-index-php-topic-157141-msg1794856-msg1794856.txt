Nah, I now think that's a dumb idea.

RE: burden of unpaid full nodes: for the immediately forseeable future, that
burden is on the order of several hundred dollars a year to buy a moderately
beefy VPS somewhere.  
  
I understand the "lets engineer for the far future" ... but, frankly, I think
too much of that is dumb. Successful projects and products engineer for the
next year or two, and re-engineer when they run into issues.  
  
Maybe the answer will be "validation pools" like we have mining pools today,
where people cooperate to validate part of the chain (bloom filters, DHTs,
mumble mumble....). Maybe hardware will just keep up.  
  
RE: race to the bottom on fees and PoW:  
  
sigh. Mike explained how that is likely to be avoided. I'm 100% convinced that
if users of the network want secure transactions they will find a way to pay
for them, whether that is assurance contracts or becoming miners themselves.
