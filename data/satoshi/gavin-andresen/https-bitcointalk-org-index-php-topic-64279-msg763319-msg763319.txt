Yes  
Yes, you could do it that way, re-using Bitcoin's Script system for
signatures. I suppose it might be useful to require m-of-n signatures for a
domain to be transferred to somebody else. I wouldn't make them full-fledged
Transactions, though (multiple "inputs" to a domain renewal or transfer
doesn't really make sense, for example).  
  
  
Yes, I think that's right, although I was imagining that the DIANNA and
bitcoin difficulties would be kept separate and not combined. Combining them
is probably a better idea (if you find any blocks that satisfy the bitcoin
difficulty but not the DIANNA+bitcoin difficulty you can still announce them
on the bitcoin network and get the block reward).  
  
RE: what is the incentive for maintaining the DHT: the registrars/mining pools
would, I think, be the primary maintainers of the DHT and their incentive to
maintaining it is the registration fees that they charge.  
  
I haven't thought deeply about possible attacks; if a DHT is used then you
have to defend against Sybil attacks (you must have some way of checking to
make sure the data you get from the DHT is valid, e.g. have the DHT nodes
return a Merkle branch down to the data they're returning that you can verify
hashes to the correct Merkle root).
