I do not understand why we FORCE a fee period?  
  
And why do we FORCE a minimum fee?  

Because there is a real cost to the network for every transaction, and the
code hasn't been fully optimized yet.  
  
Allowing users and miners to set fee policy without recompiling will happen,
but I think there are higher priority issues to tackle first.
