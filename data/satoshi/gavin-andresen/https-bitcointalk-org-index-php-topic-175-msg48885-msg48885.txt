The intrinsic value of bitcoin is in it's unique utility. That utility is
adversely affected by wild price changes.  

  
Price swings won't settle down until:  
1\. The bitcoin economy is bigger (a "market cap" of hundreds of millions of
dollars instead of just a few million dollars).  
and  
2\. Bitcoin is mature enough for people to really trust it.  
  
Unless there is somebody out there with very deep pockets and a willingness to
spend a lot of money smoothing out the fluctuations there's not a whole lot we
can do about it besides make bitcoin better, easier to use, more secure, etc.
