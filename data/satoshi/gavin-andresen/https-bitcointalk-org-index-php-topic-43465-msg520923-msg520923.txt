The testnet has suffered rewrite-the-block-chain-with-more-hashing-power
attacks.  
  
It does bad things to your wallet, if your wallet contains transactions that
depend on previously mined but now-no-longer-valid blocks. I suspect it will
cause lots of heartburn for exchanges; this patch from sipa (which hasn't been
extensively tested because long block-chain re-orgs on the main chain are not
an issue) might help:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/195  
  
Alternatively, removing all the wtx wallet transactions stored in the wallet
and then running with -rescan should get back to a sane state. Although an
exchange may very well find customers end up with negative balances after
doing that, and customers will likely be upset that their balances are likely
to change from what they think they have if they've deposited invalid-under-
the-new-chain transactions.  
  
Successfully bootstrapping an alternative chain starting from a low
difficulty, given that there are people with lots of potential hashing power
and the willingness to mess around with the chain "just because they can,"
seems like a hard problem to me, although if people were willing to accept
some centralization until hashing power got to a "safe" level it could be
solved by a central authority publishing block-chain checkpoints every X
blocks.
