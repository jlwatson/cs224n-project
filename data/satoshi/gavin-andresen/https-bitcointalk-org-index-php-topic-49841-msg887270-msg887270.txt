To get the conversation started, here are some functions I think a Bitcoin
Foundation could perform:  

  * Interact with the legal system, where a centralized entity is needed: for example, to hold the Bitcoin trademark, own/control the bitcoin.org domain name, etc.  

  * Act as a central library for accurate information about Bitcoin, so journalists and policymakers have an 'official' place to learn about Bitcoin.  

  * Collect donations to fund infrastructure necessary for Bitcoin's growth (organize regular developers' conferences or get-togethers maybe? pay for development of cross-implementation testing tools? pay core developers' salaries? create a certification/testing program for Bitcoin implementations? create a central clearinghouse for information about legal issues surrounding Bitcoin across the world?)  

I like decentralized approaches, because failures are less catastrophic and
because I think smaller, focused organizations are more effective than big,
try-to-be-everything-to-everybody organizations.  
  
So I'm happy that the Cryptocurrency Legal Advocacy Group is working on legal
issues, starting with figuring out what the issues are.  
  
And I'm happy that LoveBitcoins have been starting PR/Marketing efforts for
Bitcoin.  
  
Today I created the Bitcoin Testing Project to tackle some infrastructure
needs that I think are being ignored (rigorous quality assurance / testing):
