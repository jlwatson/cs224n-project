  
That is like 9/11 conspiracy theorists saying "there is a real debate to be
had!" ... after they repeatedly fail to listen to rational arguments ("Jet
Fuel doesn't burn that hot! It cannot melt steel!" ... after being patiently
told about the physics of furnaces: burning in a heat-trapping chamber).  
  
I still haven't heard any rational arguments on how the payment protocol is
worse for privacy. If piotr_n makes one, please let me know.
