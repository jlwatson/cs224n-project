I'll try to answer what I can:  
  
You either have to run a node or trust somebody else (like MyBitcoin.com) to
keep a wallet for you.  
  
Your account balance is stored in a Berkeley DB file called 'wallet.dat' (what
directory depends on your operating system; on my Mac it is
~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallet.dat, on linux it is
~/.bitcoin/wallet.dat, not sure about PCs).  
  
The only application that can read wallet.dat is the bitcoin code, and the
database structure isn't documented anywhere besides the bitcoin C++ source
code.  
Theoretically, no, but the code to do lightweight validation hasn't been
written.  
Satoshi is planning on encrypting the wallet database, so you'd need to enter
a password to read it. (and they need to get your private keys to generate
transactions-- those are what are stored in the wallet.dat)  
Dunno.  
There's another thread about this in these forums; maybe we should start a
"Satoshi's TODO list" thread and get folks to volunteer to help out.  
Fewer and fewer coins will be created over the next N years (where N is--
what, 20?). That's a feature, not a bug...  
  
RE: developing your own version: are you thinking of creating a second bitcoin
implementation that is compatible with the existing C++ one (good idea, in my
opinion)? Or creating a similar-but-not-the-same system (bad idea, in my
opinion)?
