I've deployed a -testnet version of ClearCoin, at:  
https://testnet.clearcoin.appspot.com/  
  
It is fully functional, so feel free to creates some escrow transactions and
get some testnet bitcoins from the the testnet faucet (which I will eventually
move to testnet.freebitcoins.appspost.com).  
  
For anybody else developing on App Engine, here's what I did to make it work:  
  
In my main.py:  

Code:

# Set testnet namespace  
if 'test' in os.environ['CURRENT_VERSION_ID']:  
set_namespace('testnet')  

CURRENT_VERSION_ID is the version of your app that's running, and is set by
App Engine.  
set_namespace makes all subsequent datastore and memcache operations
read/write from a different database. So almost all of the code for ClearCoin
doesn't care whether it is handling testnet coins, it just works.  
  
The only other change needed was a check for 'test' in
os.environ['CURRENT_VERSION_ID'] when deciding which bitcoind server to use. I
run the -testnet bitcoind for ClearCoin on a different machine than the
production bitcoind, so experiments on the test net won't affect the
production ClearCoin at all.  
  
If you're not running on App Engine, you should think about building in the
equivalent of CURRENT_VERSION_ID and 'set_namespace' so deploying test and
production versions of your application is easy.
