I didn't have time yesterday, but here's the email conversation:

**Me:**

Interesting.  How do we decide what "T" should be ?

My knee-jerk reaction: I bet a much simpler rule would work, like:

    max block size = 2 * average size of last 144 blocks.

That would keep the network at about 50% utilization, which is enough to keep transaction fees falling from to zero just due to people having a time preference for having transactions confirmed in the next 1/2/3 blocks (see http://hashingit.com/analysis/34-bitcoin-traffic-bulletin ).

I think this simple equation is very misleading:
    Bigger blocks -> Harder to run a node -> Less nodes -> More centralization

People are mostly choosing to run SPV nodes or web-based wallets because:

    Fully validating -> Less convenience -> Less nodes -> More centralization

Node count on the network started dropping as soon as good SPV wallets were available, I doubt the block size will have any significant effect.

**Meni's reply:**

Hi Gavin,

 (1a). I don't believe in having a block limit calculated automatically based on past blocks. Because it really doesn't put a limit at all. Suppose I wanted to spam the network. Now there is a limit of 1MB/block so I create 1MB/block of junk. If I keep this up the rule will update the size to 2MB/block, and then I spam with 2MB/block. Then 4MB, ad infinitum. The effects of increasing demand for legitimate transaction is similar. There's no real limit and no real market for fees.

 b. I'll clarify again my goal here is not to solve the problem of what the optimal block limit is - that's a separate problem. I want to prevent a scenario where a wrong block limit creates catastrophic failure. With a soft cap, any parameter choice creates a range of legitimate block sizes.

You could set now T = 3MB, and if in the future we see that tx fees are too high and there are enough blocks, increase it.

 (2). I have described one causal path. Of course SPV is a stronger causal path but it's also completely irrelevant, because SPV clients are already here and we don't want them to go away. They are a given. Block size, however, is something we can influence; and the primary drawback of bigger blocks is, as I described, the smaller number of nodes.

You can argue that the effect is insignificant - but it is still the case that
Many people currently do believe the effect is significant, and
This argument will be easier to discuss once we don't have to worry about crash landing.

 (3). Thanks, I'll try to examine Greg's proposal in more detail.

**My reply**

Who are "you" ?

Are you a miner or an end-user?

If you are a miner, then you can produce maximum-sized blocks and influence the average size based on your share of hash rate. But miners who want to keep blocks small have equal influence.

If you are an end-user, how do you afford transaction fees to spam the network?

----------------------

If you are arguing that transaction fees may not give miners enough reward to secure the network in the future, I wrote about that here:

and here:

And re: "there is no real limit and no real market for fees" :  see
  http://gavinandresen.ninja/the-myth-of-not-full-blocks

There IS a market for fees, even now, because there is demand for "I want my transaction to confirm in the next block or three."
