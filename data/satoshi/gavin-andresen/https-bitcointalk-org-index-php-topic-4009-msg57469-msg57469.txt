This is: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues#issue/86  
  
currently (2011/03/01) a backlog of transactions that dont seem make it into
blocks is building up (according to ArtForz now 670 transactions).  
  
People are starting to complain, see
http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3835.msg57031#msg57031 for an example.  
  
This was discussed on #bitcoin-dev  
  
ArtForz> that tx should have a score of 20567855  
ArtForz> so it falls short of the dPriority > COIN * 144 / 250 test  
ArtForz> and as tx size is > 4000, fAllowFree is never true for it  
theymos> Ah. So it will never confirm?  
ArtForz> probably not  
  
ArtForz> looks like the tx-sending code needs some fixing  
molecular> like not generate a tx with a score too low, or suggest to add a
fee?  
ArtForz> yep  
ArtForz> check size and priority of transaction, if it's > 4kB and score <
57600000 require min fee  
ArtForz> maybe reduce the size limit to 3.5k or so, otherwise it can only get
into an otherwise empty block  
  
Maybe the transaction cache should not be unlimited?
