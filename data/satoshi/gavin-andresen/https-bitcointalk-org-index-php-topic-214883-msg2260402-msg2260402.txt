That's one reason I see alt-coins as strengthening cryptocurrency overall;
they can sit back and watch what works and what doesn't for Bitcoin and learn
from mistakes.  

  
Except they're not learning from Bitcoin's mistakes; how many alt coins have
fixed the problems on Bitcoin's hard-fork wish list?
