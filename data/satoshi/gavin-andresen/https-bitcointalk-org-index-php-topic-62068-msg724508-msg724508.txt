FYI: I pulled:  
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/686  
  
... which will likely result in a testnet blockchain split on February 15'th.
I hadn't pulled before because I was busy with other things. The testnet
faucet bitcoind will be updated in the next day or two.  
  
See this thread for the design discussion.
