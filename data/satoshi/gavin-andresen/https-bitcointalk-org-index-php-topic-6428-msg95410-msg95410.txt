If an attacker can force you to sign arbitrary messages, that's certainly a
security flaw. The solution is to take good care that you approve of whatever
content you are thinking of signing whether it be cheques, loan agreements,
wills or numbers.  

  
So: the danger isn't revealing private keys (I mis-remembered), the danger is
a naive developer will see the signmessage RPC command, not realize that
signing arbitrary data can be dangerous, and put up a web page that lets
somebody enter arbitrary data to be signed with one of the developer's public
keys.  
  
This might just be a documentation issue, although if signmessage was changed
to sign a hash of the passed-in message instead of the message itself then it
would be completely safe.
