The behind-the-firewall nodes will need the following from an on-the-network
bitcoind:  
  
1\. They need to be able to ask it "tell me about any transactions to these
bitcoin addresses..."  
2\. They need to be able to send it a signed transaction and ask "Please
broadcast this for me."  
  
Item 1 is implemented in my monitorreceived patch (
https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/tree/monitorreceived ).  
  
Item 2 would be cool. Anybody want to design and develop an "accept
transaction" patch?  
  
All the other functionality needed (like generating public/private keys,
generating and signing transactions) could be, and should be, in my opinion,
be done as a project separate from bitcoin. Making the code small and self-
contained and as secure as possible would be the goal; it could be re-used to
create a type of lightweight client that ran on cell phones in addition to
running behind corporate firewalls.
