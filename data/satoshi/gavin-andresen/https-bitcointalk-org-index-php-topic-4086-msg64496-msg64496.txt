Is there a PHP implementation that does not use double-precision floating
point?  
After doing a little googling I couldn't figure out the answer to that. I will
be MUCH more sympathetic to changing the JSON-RPC api if there is.  
  
And mizerydearia: re: the witcoin issue: You say:  
"I see the transaction as 0.94 However, http://json-rpc.org/ retrieves the
data as 0.93999999999999994671"  
  
So why when you display that value are you truncating it instead of rounding
it to 8 decimal places?  
For example:  
  
... or to convert to an integer-number-of-base-unit:  
  
All of that assume that your php support double-precision floating point,
which brings me back to my question: are there any php implementations that do
not?
