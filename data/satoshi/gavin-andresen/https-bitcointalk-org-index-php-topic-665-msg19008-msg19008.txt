RE: one mandatory account: yes, the empty-string-named-account will be the
"master" account.  
  
RE: existing use cases: you should be able to do everything you can do now...
EXCEPT for change the label of bitcoin address after it is created. Although
associating a unique transaction ID to a bitcoin address seems like the wrong
thing to do (since the same bitcoin address might be re-used for multiple
transactions; your application might not allow that, but the addresses are
publicly available in the block chain and you might be opening yourself up to
unpleasant hacks if you don't consider what should happen if an old bitcoin
address that you THOUGHT would be used only once receives a few bit-
pennies....)  
  
This morning I thought through what might happen in case of a disaster and a
service using accounts had to restore from a wallet backup and some other,
alternative source of transaction history (maybe application-specific
transaction logs sent to an offsite logging server).  
  
Assuming your backup is recent enough for your keypoolsize, no bitcoins will
be lost, but account balances will be wrong because any "move", "sendfrom",
and associate-bitcoin-address-with-account actions will be lost.  
  
I've tweaked the proposed API to make recovery easier; I'm still thinking
about "setlabel" -- in the recovery case, you definitely DO want to be able to
re-associate bitcoin addresses with accounts...
