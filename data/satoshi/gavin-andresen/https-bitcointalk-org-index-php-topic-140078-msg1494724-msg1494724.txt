Sergio:  
  
It **would** be more helpful if you either took a little bit more time and
actually wrote a little bit of code to make sure the attack works, and started
the conversation privately with "here's code that demonstrates a very
expensive-to-verify transaction and a few suggestions on how you might fix
it..."  
  
I created a simulation of TxPrep/TxAttack by adding them to
src/test/data/script_valid.json and then running through the script_tests.cpp
unit test in the debugger, and with the particular TxPrep you propose there is
no problem with current code.  
  
Also, TxAttack is not standard with the latest code; see
CTransaction::AreInputsStandard(), which checks the scriptPubKeys being spent.  
  
RE: undocumented process of responsible disclosing : good point. Where would
you expect to find the process documented? We can fix that...
