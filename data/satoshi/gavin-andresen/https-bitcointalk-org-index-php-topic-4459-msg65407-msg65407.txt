So I got email today from a merchant asking the most-frequently-asked
question: if I just put a bitcoin address on my "pay me" page, how do I know
who paid me?  
  
Which got me to wondering... can we do better than answer "run a bitcoin
daemon and ask it for a new address for every order" or "use a shopping cart
interface from your online wallet provider" ?  
  
Ideally, the web software could generate a payment URI without talking to
bitcoind, and copying/pasting or clicking on the URI would generate a
transaction tagged with the right order ID.  
  
Adding another transaction type that allows (say) an extra, arbitrary 512
bytes of data mostly solves the problem; the web software could encrypt or
hash the order ID and generate a transaction that is the store's public
bitcoin address and the encrypted/hashed order ID (or customer number or
whatever).  
  
Can we do better? It would be nice if it was impossible to tell how many
orders the merchant was getting...
