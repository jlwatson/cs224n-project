  
bitcoin/bitcoin is the 0.6 tree  
  
I haven't done a code review of the anon-ish coin control, so I don't know if
it will mess up 0.6 testing; it might interfere with the multisignature
transaction changes.  
  
The github issues tracker is the best to report any bugs you find, for general
"it sucks" or "I love it" or "can you make this new RPC command to this" the
best place is either IRC chat or right here.
