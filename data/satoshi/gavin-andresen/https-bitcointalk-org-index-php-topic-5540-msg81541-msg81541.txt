Stuff is valuable because it is either useful (like hammers) or we think it is
pretty (like Picasso paintings); the more rare, useful, and/or desirable
something is, the more valuable it tends to be.  
  
We know how rare bitcoins are. It remains to be seen how useful they are. I
think they're pretty useful as both a convenient way of paying for things and
as a long-term store of value, but it will take time to convince most people
that they're useful for those things.
