The default block-filling algorithm that most miners are running is:  
  
\+ Fill up part of the block with the highest transactions, regardless of fees  
\+ Then fill up the rest of the block with as many fee-paying transactions as
possible, highest fee-per-kilobyte first.  
  
... so flooding the network with high-fee transactions won't "stall Bitcoin."
Well, except for people playing SatoshiDice or doing something else that
results in lots of low-priority fee-paying transactions (and even there, they
could always opt to pay a little more in transaction fees).
