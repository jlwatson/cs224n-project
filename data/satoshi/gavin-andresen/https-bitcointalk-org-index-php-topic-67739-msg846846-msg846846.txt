Some of the big mining pool operators are already going their own way,
experimenting with new types of transactions (e.g. deepbit and eligius), so I
suspect the answer to your question "Can 'we' please hold off..." is "No."  
  
Discussions like this one are how I start to understand parts of the protocol
like nLockTime and transaction replacement better.  
  
  
As for BIP 16 draining effort away from making the standard client scale: I've
been saying for a year that my top priorities are network stability and wallet
security. Making the standard client scale is, in my opinion, a lower
priority; I don't want a super-scalable client with a 4-minute blockchain
initial block sync time if it is vulnerable to the user clicking one wrong
link and getting infected by a trojan wallet stealer.
