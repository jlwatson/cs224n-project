You can setup your own f2f bitcoin network using the -connect option,
connecting only to friends.  
  
One of those friends must be connected to the rest of the bitcoin world, of
course.  
  
Experimenting with sending transactions and blocks over XMPP or some other
network is a great idea-- go for it! It shouldn't be hard to create a "bitcoin
bridge" that relays traffic on the main bitcoin network to/from another
network.
