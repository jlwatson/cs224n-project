Y'all read the pull request, yes?  
  
So: if you have a better suggestion for fixing the problem of new users
wasting lots of time gathering tiny drips and drabs of bitcoins, and then
getting upset when they can't spend them (because it costs more in fees that
they are worth), I'm open to suggestions.  
  
RE: "what about when bitcoins are worth a million dollars apiece"  
  
Umm, that's what the "un-hardcode TX_FEE constants" part is all about?  
  
RE: trolling about Foundation setting the fee:  
  
Go back under your rock, please. This pull request is the first step towards a
market between miners (who want higher fees) and merchants/users (who want
lower fees, but also want their transactions confirmed). Miners can already
control what fees they accept, this pull lets users control (very clumsily,
improvements on the road map) the fee they are willing to pay.
