Losing double-spent transactions should probably be reported as
-1/unconfirmed, -2/unconfirmed, etc -- meaning "there is a N-confirmed
transaction that conflicts with this one."  
  
-6/unconfirmed seems like the natural "this transaction ain't never gonna be confirmed, time to report it as -N/orphan."  
  
-1/unconfirmed should be enough to stop re-transmitting it.  
  
And -120/orphan seems like a safe time to "unspend" any inputs (let them be
spent by new transactions) that weren't spent by the other, conflicting
transaction.  
  
... he says nonchalantly, knowing full well that actually making bitcoin
behave that way means a lot of very careful coding and lots and lots of
careful testing...  
  
The shortcut, maybe-good-enough-for-now solution: export all the private keys
from all the messed up wallets. Start with a clean wallet, then re-import all
the private keys and let the clean-slate bitcoin figure it all out.
