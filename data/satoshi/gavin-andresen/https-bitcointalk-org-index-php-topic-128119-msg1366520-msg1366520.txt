I was under the impression that P2SH was intended for all multi-sig
transactions, though you are right there is no reason plain-text multi-sig
can't be used (is there? they were probably never added to isStandard...). One
reason for desiring P2SH, _in general_ , is that very long scripts become part
of the TxIns instead of the TxOuts. This means that they will never bloat a
pruned version of the blockchain. If everyone only used P2SH, then no TxOut
script would ever be longer than 22 bytes.  

You can use plain multisig if you like, they WERE added to IsStandard.
