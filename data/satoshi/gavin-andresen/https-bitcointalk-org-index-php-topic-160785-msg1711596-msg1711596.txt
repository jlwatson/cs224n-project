r.willis is confused about the BIP process.  
  
It is not "Write a specification. Submit a BIP. Argue for a while, revise the
specification. Finalize BIP, then everybody agrees to implement it."  
  
I know there are standardization processes that try to work that way, and
they're generally miserable failures. You end up with bloated specifications
and implementations that don't work with each other because everybody
interprets the spec slightly differently.  
  
I like the IETF model, of working code and rough consensus. So, once the
payment protocol is implemented and early adopters have had a chance to play
with it, it will become a formal BIP. Until then, as Mike said, I'll be
tweaking https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/4120476 as I run into issues.
