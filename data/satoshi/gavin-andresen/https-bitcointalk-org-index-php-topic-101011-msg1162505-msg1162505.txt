this situation makes bitcoin seem like it's run by a group of people with
inside info. decentralized my ass.  
  
this makes me feel left out.  

You're missing the point of Bitcoin if you feel left out. You can be as
involved as you want to be, just go make something happen-- find something you
think needs doing, recruit some people to help if you need help, and do it.
Are you waiting for an invitation or permission from somebody?
