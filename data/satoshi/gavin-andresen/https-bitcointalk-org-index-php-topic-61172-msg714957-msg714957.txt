  
Let me count the ways:  
  
1\. You must explicitly choose a username and password; you must have enough
tech know-how to find your bitcoin.conf directory or run with -rpcpasswrod=
options.  
  
2\. If you choose a short password, then every failed access attempt DOES
trigger a timeout.  
  
3\. You must explicitly tell bitcoin to listen for connections from IP
addresses other than localhost, using the rpcallowip= option.  
  
4\. You must open a hole in your firewall that lets any arbitrary IP address
through to your rpcport.  
  
I'm sorry you lost 75 bitcoins, but you really made a LOT of mistakes. Adding
more layers of protection to the RPC interface isn't high on the development
priority list, but if anybody wants to volunteer to keep track of number of
failed RPC authentication attempts over time then be my guest and write a
patch. Just be sure it isn't vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks by people
deliberately generating failed login attempts.
