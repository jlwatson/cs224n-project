... Poor wording on my part. A couple hundred to a couple thousand full nodes spread across the world is plenty to be robust end secure (a dozen or three in each country).

Supporting SPV nodes is another reason for lots of nodes, but I haven't done the math to figure out how many SPV nodes one full node can easily support.
