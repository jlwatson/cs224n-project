While we ponder this, if you are worried about this, there is a fairly
straightforward workaround that will make you immune from this.  
  
Run two bitcoin daemons. One that is a full peer in the network, but has an
empty, never-used wallet.  
  
And another with a full wallet that connects to the full peer. You could even
run them both on the same machine (you'll use double the CPU and disk space,
unfortunately).  
  
RE: "I better alert people before they can be tracked" :  
  
Dan Kaminsky demonstrated that it is pretty easy to tie bitcoin addresses to
IP addresses by watching the network last year. If you are worried about being
tracked, you should be running bitcoin over Tor and connecting to only trusted
nodes. We make no anonymity guarantees.
