The biggest thing non programmers can do is TEST IT! One bug was found a
little while ago were some coins were lost with the encryption. **The more
testers there is testing the encryption, the faster they can release it!** Try
moving money around with a few coins, pretty much try to get the client to not
work as expected!

If you can, please help test, it really helps. Patch for wallet encryption is
at: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/232  
As bitlotto says, us a wallet with very few coins in it and/or run with the
-testnet flag to use test network coins.
