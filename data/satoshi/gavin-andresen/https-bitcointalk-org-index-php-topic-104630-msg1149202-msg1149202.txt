Unless you can clearly explain, in small words that even I can understand, HOW
you are getting the bitcoins to **pay** interest I'm going to assume that this
is Yet Another Ponzi Scheme.  
  
I understand how SatoshiDice makes money, and I have no issues with them
generating lots of transactions.  
  
If you were **CHARGING** interest then I would understand, and would have no
issues with your service.  
  
So: how will HungerCoins make money? And don't answer "I can't tell you or
everybody else will do it," that is the Ponzi-operator's standard answer.
