It was LC_NUMERIC, I bet... (I'd just set LANG and unset the rest and assumed
they'd all get picked up; internationalizing C++ applications is something I
know very little about).  
  
I modified the patch to format numbers the way they were formatted before:
always , for the thousands separator, and . for the decimal point (instead of
letting sprintf try to do the right thing).
