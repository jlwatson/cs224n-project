Interesting idea!

bitcoind's memory pool already keeps track of when (at what time) a transaction entered the pool.

Probably the best thing to do would be for the IBLT to have a "time created" timestamp, and when peers reconstruct they ignore mempool transactions they received after that timestamp.
