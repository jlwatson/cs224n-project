I'll be trying to create openSuse and SLE packages too, Debian would be
possible too, but compiling wx, boost and libdb sounds a bit excessive to me,
anyone interested in helping?  

  
Nightly builds are a great idea; does the build service do an automatic svn
update? Anybody else willing to help get GUI-bitcoin building (or anybody know
somebody on the wxWidgets team?)
