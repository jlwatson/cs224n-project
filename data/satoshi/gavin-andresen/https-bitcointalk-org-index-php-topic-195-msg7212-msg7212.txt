I would like to enable users to create other custom assets. The asset would
have a globally unique hash and could ben sent / recved to addresses. For
example, a company could issue "shares" that could then be exchanged and
verified by bitcoin. A game engine could issue its own type of currency and
have it tracked.  
  
Is anything like this even remotely possible with scripts or would that
require a breaking change? Is it even possible to 'upgrade' the network to
support such an option at this point?  

I don't think you need scripts to do something like that.  
  
Just send a bitcoin to yourself, and then declare that transaction is the
"root transaction for My Valuable Asset."  
  
You'd need a custom client that only accepted or spent transactions that could
be entirely traced back to that Root Transaction (not hard, all transactions
can be tracked back). And shows fractions of that coin as units of your custom
currency. And you'd probably want to make some other changes so your users
didn't accidently (or purposely) mix Your Valuable Asset coin with regular
bitcoins (like a custom wallet and different scheme for generating payment
addresses).
