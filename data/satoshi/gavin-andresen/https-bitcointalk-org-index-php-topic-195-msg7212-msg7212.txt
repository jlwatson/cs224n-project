I don't think you need scripts to do something like that.  
  
Just send a bitcoin to yourself, and then declare that transaction is the
"root transaction for My Valuable Asset."  
  
You'd need a custom client that only accepted or spent transactions that could
be entirely traced back to that Root Transaction (not hard, all transactions
can be tracked back). And shows fractions of that coin as units of your custom
currency. And you'd probably want to make some other changes so your users
didn't accidently (or purposely) mix Your Valuable Asset coin with regular
bitcoins (like a custom wallet and different scheme for generating payment
addresses).
