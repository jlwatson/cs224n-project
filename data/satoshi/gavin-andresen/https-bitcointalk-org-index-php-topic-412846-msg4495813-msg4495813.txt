No, I think that is when he goes to the Bilderberger meet-up (not on google
meet-ups btw) ...  

  
Bilderberger meetup is in Barbados this year. But don't tell anybody, it is a

PS to dewdeded: Mike Hearn and I both own non-US passports, so putting us on
Team USA is funny. We should be Team Global Conspiracy (mmm... gotta get
T-shirts made...).
