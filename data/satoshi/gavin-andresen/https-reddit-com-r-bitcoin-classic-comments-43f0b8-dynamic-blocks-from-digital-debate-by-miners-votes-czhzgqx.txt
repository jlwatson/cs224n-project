I like simple.

So my favorite idea is a variation of the dynamic limit proposed by Stephen Pair of Bitpay: limit is double the average cost over the last difficulty adjustment period.

Miners control that by simply deciding how large to make their blocks (or what minimum fee they want to set).

Empty blocks created because full broadcast or validation takes too long impose a natural limit-- if blocks  get too expensive, empty blocks get built on top, driving down the limit.

Blocks would, on average, by definition, be half full-- which is a good number because it means people who care to get their transactions confirmed quickly will have to outbid people who don't care.
