Selling my Butterfly Labs BitForce 5 GH/s SC (aka Jalapeno) ASIC miner.  
  
It has been reliably cranking out about 5 and a half GH/s at about 35 watts
for  
two weeks now; I'm selling it just so I have one less thing in my life to
think about.  
  
I paid 25.9 BTC for it; best offer over 26 BTC before 16:00 UTC Sunday, 9 June
gets it.  
I'll ship it UPS/USPS/Fedex on the 10'th or 11'th, you must pay shipping (e.g.
if you  
want it overnight, add shipping charges from Amherst, MA 01002 to your
payment).  
  
PGP signed version of the above, so you know this is really me and not a
scammer who managed to hack my forum account:
