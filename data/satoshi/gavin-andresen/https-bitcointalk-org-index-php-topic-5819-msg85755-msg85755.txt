That pattern is definitely the faucet. The big mining pools are already using
the new 'sendmany' functionality to pay lots of people with one transaction.  
  
I'm thinking of doing something similar for the Faucet. Perhaps:  
  
\+ Bundle up requests for payments, so instead of sending out payment right
away you have to wait a bit (15 minutes or an hour or... something somewhat
random and non-predictable).  
  
\+ Dropping the Faucet reward AGAIN so there is less incentive to cheat. I'll
need to use sendmany so the faucet isn't paying as much in fees as it is in
bitcoins it gives out.  
  
And maybe:  
  
\+ Publicly display the queue of waiting requests. This would be the tricky
part-- I don't want to just dump email address and IP address, but I do want
to dump enough information so people looking at the information can tell the
difference between a cheater and legitimate users.  
  
\+ A way of flagging requests as "looks like cheating to me". This is also
hard-- griefers might decide it would be fun to flag lots of legitimate
requests.
