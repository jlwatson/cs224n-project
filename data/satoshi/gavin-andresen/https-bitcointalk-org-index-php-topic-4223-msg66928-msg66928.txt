  
Sirius and I both have access to the webserver, although Sirius knows a lot
more about Drupal than I do.  
  
But if somebody puts together Drupal templates (theme? what does Drupal call
them/it?) with the spiffy new look I'd be happy to upload them. Or, even
better, create a Drupal account for that somebody so they can update the look
and content themself and fix the bugs that are almost certainly going to
happen.
