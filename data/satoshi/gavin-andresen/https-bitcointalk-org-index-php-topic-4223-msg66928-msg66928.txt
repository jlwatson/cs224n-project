Well, I'm guessing Gavin has access to the website server. Someone needs to
turn that design into usable code first, though. That may be difficult or not
so difficult depending on the CMS bitcoin.org is using, if any.  

  
Sirius and I both have access to the webserver, although Sirius knows a lot
more about Drupal than I do.  
  
But if somebody puts together Drupal templates (theme? what does Drupal call
them/it?) with the spiffy new look I'd be happy to upload them. Or, even
better, create a Drupal account for that somebody so they can update the look
and content themself and fix the bugs that are almost certainly going to
happen.
