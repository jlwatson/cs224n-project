Maybe related: it is economically rational to NOT use all of your hashing power to mine for yourself, but to use some of it to attack big pools:

That would fit the rise in "other" hashing power (keep your hashing private so you can't be attacked) and the decline of the biggest pools-- have the biggest pools had an unexplained increase of 'bad luck' since they've been declining?
