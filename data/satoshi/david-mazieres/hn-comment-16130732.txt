What's interesting is that SCP implements consensus without electing a leader.
There are, of course, numerous asynchronous protocols that do this, like Ben
Or, Rabin, Most√©faoui, and most recently HoneyBadger, but is rarer for
synchronous protocols like SCP. However, it is necessary for SCP's setting,
because if you don't even have agreement among nodes over what nodes do and
don't exist in the system, how could you hope to elect a leader.

One way to view how SCP avoids leader election is to consider that it is
effectively emulating the leader. SCP has two phases, a nomination and a
balloting phase. The nomination phase is effectively like one or more
instances of an asynchronous broadcast protocol (which don't require a leader
since multiple nodes can choose to broadcast). The balloting phase is like
Paxos, except that the value to propose is embedded in the ballot number so
nodes don't require a leader to tell them what is being proposed--they can
each emulate the leader themselves.
