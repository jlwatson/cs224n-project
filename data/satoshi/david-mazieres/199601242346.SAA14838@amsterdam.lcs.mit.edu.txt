So where exactly do they draw the line?  You can still construct your
software in such a way that there is a clean boundary between the
crypto stuff and the rest.

For example, could you have an application with a  function:

	authenticate_user (int file_descriptor)

which in the exportable version sends a password, and in the domestic 
version constructs some sort of authenticator?

Could you have an xdr-like function which on in an exportable version
just does argument marshaling and in a domestic version also encrypts?

How exactly are crypto-hooks defined?  This restriction seems orders
of magnitude more bogus than even the ban on exporting actual
encryption.
