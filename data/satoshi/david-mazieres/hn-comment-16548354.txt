If you are so allergic to cryptocurrency, why didn't it bother you when
Keybase started writing their root into the Bitcoin blockchain
(https://keybase.io/docs/server_security/merkle_root_in_bitco...)?

There are obviously annoying ways in which keybase could support
cryptocurrency, but you are making a lot of assumptions about what Keybase is
going to do that are not based on the blog post. For example, wallets do not
mine coins and Stellar does not support mining.

Why don't you wait to see what comes out and submit a feature request if you
don't like it, instead of flipping out about some hypothetical feature you
won't like.
