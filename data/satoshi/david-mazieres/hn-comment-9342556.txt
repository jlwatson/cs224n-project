You are correct that safety requires overlapping quorums. However, the trust
decisions are public, as this is what allows participants to discover quorums.
The scenario you describe of two groups of 100 participants overlapping at one
node might or might not be a problem. The most likely cause of such a topology
is a Sybil attack, in which an attacker with one seat at the table gloms an
extra 99 nodes onto the system that nobody trusts. The attackers' 100 nodes
might of course diverge if they are so configured, but nobody will care.

A priori, we cannot definitively answer what kind of topology will emerge. But
there is certainly precedent for building a robust network out of pairwise
relationships, namely inter-domain routing on the Internet.
