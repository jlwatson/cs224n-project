Bitshares is more democratic than decentralized. Basically people vote their
stakes to elect 100 nodes that ensure consensus, but everyone knows who the
100 nodes are. By contrast, the FBA trust model is completely independent of
coin holdings, and just depends on pairwise relationships between the
validator nodes. The resulting quorum structure is unlikely to look like a
single fully-connected group.
