The problem with RC4 is that it works in OFB only.  If I need data
integrity in the face of known plaintext, I will need to compute a MAC
in paralell with the encryption which could significantly slow things
down.  With a block cypher in CFB, I can just re-encrypt the last
block of data.

That said, OFB has the advantage that I can overlap computation of the
RC4 stream with I/O, which might be a win for me.  Are there any MACs
significantly faster than say ~50 cycles per byte?
