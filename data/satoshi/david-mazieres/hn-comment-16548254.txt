How is Stellar still "in the gate," more than two years after deploying their
decentralized Byzantine agreement algorithm?

Ripple has only just now, in 2018, published their decentralized consensus
algorithm (Cobalt), which as far as I know is not even in production use yet,
and doesn't provide optimal safety. (In settings where Cobalt is guaranteed
Safe, SCP would be too, but not vice versa.) Their production network still
uses a protocol that, by Ripple's own analysis
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07242), fails to guarantee safety without >90%
agreement on the UNL.
