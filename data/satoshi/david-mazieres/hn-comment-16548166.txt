Note that in general there is no way to name a particular branch of a
blockchain fork. In cases with a protocol change coordinated well in advance,
a counterparty anticipating the fork could announce that their tokens on one
branch will be useless. However, if you just have two competing mining pools
duking it out with the same protocol, there will be no way to name the
branches ahead of time.

What's worse is that colored coins could distort the incentive structure to
make it profitable to bribe miners, because the benefit to an attacker of
subverting consensus could far outweigh the value of 12.5 BTC/block.
