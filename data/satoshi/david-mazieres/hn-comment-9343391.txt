So first, a lot of problems with Internet routing do not really affect SCP's
safety--for example bogus route announcements. Part of the reason is that SCP
depends on transitive reachability. And of course part of the reason is that
SCP is built on top of the Internet, so can already assume a basically running
network underneath.

I can't predict the future, but I do think it is likely that a bunch of de
facto important players will emerge and have fairly complete pairwise
dependencies. One reason is that Stellar follows a gateway model, where
counterparties issue credits. So for example, down the line people might want
to store their money as Chase or Citibank USD credits. So people will already
have some notion that some participants are trustworthy enough to hold their
USD deposits, and these institutions will emerge as important. If I'm a
Citibank customer and you send me money, I obviously won't consider the
payment complete until Citibank says it is. And of course Citibank is likely
to want to depend on a bunch of institutions they do business with, so even
just one bank should give me good transitive reachability.

But the nice thing about safety is that you can reduce any individual party's
trust by depending on more people. So for example Stellar will run a validator
node for the foreseeable future, and their incentives are different from
Citibank's. To gain more trust in the system, I might want to wait for both
Stellar and Citibank to agree before considering any payment fully settled.
