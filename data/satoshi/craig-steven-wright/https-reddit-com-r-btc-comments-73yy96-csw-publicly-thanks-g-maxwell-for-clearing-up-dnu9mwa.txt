/u/midmagic
First, at no point did I offer any proof for you. Nor do I have any inclination to do any such thing in public, it is you who seek this, not I. Your so-called debunking is evidence that you:
1.	Have an agenda,
2.	Cannot comprehend English, or
3.	Deceive.
As /u/Cryptorebel states, you decided to tell the world you debunked a proof when there is nothing of the sort.

As for your *“February 2012 SKS keyset, a copy of which I retain”*. Yes, I love how all these Red Herring swim about. 

First there is the issue of the keyset and this not being a definitive set of keys, but the real issue is your **non-existent**, **unverified**, **unlinked** but promised document. You use the Archive server when you have something, but expect others to believe you when it suits to make a proposition that you *claim* to have proof of. Yet that never comes to light nor existed. Forensic documents that are not related, but when tangible evidence is called for, it is the bait and switch into a separate topic. 

And yes, the system (the HPC/ computers) that did exist and the staff that still work for us. Again, your claims are based on a lack of evidence being evidence. I am sorry to tell you, that is not the case. [1]

I have no interest in seeking to offer you any proof. I see no benefit in any position. If I was to define myself as something because people want to have a king, then I would be no better than /u/nullc and his crowd. People should not blindly follow others in Bitcoin. It is not a dictatorship and there cannot be a crowned emperor. 

/u/nullc stated he would leave if I was to sign certain keys. Why would that be a goal, it is not a victor in competition or by the best offer to the market, it is a collectivist coup. As for your desire for me to be or not be something, this is not my concern. What you consistently fail to comprehend is that I have no need of your “support”, backing, or anything else.

Do I desire that you no longer believe I am a fraud or a conman? I do not care. Your belief is not a factor in anything we do nor would anything change in either case. 

For you /u/nullc,
My post does not admit or deny being who you claim that I claim to be. You don't see that do you? You also have not refuted ANYTHING in my post. Not a single thing, nothing at all. 


Because your best argument is providing links to false information from the media as well as this classic :
