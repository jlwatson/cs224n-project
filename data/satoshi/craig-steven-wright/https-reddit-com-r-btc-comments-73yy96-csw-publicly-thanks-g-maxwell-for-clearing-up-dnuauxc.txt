No I'm not doing this at all Greg. 

I'm thanking you for clearing up misconceptions. You initially led people to believe that the PGP keys were forged, but then when called out, you later added that it was possible that is was not forged because it is possible to override the settings.  You said so yourself, many times. That you **THOUGHT** it was backdated, but that you had no proof. It's there to read again. 



I'm saying thank you for clearing that up. Why the need for the attack Greg? I'm saying THANK YOU.
