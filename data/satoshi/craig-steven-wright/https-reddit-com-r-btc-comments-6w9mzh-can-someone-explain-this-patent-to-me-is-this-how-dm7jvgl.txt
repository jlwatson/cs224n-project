As for ASICboost. It is not the so called attack that has been touted by GMin.

I have used an atomic force and MFM microscope and have a published peer reviewed research paper from those efforts.

If anyone tells you they have reverse engineered a chip in under 6 months then I have a large New York Bridge to sell you.

Nor does the patent offer the level of touted benifit in any event.
