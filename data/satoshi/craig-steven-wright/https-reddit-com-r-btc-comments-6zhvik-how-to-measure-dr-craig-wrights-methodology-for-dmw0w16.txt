As for your question, there are methods and we have data, but it is not as rigorous for others as I would like. 

One thing that we have in the pipeline is to make this more available.

The means are there and you can do this in Matlab, but it is a project that needs to be simplified and maybe just have a web front-end to access and analyse.

We would be honoured to become a part of making this more accessible. So, we are more than happy to discuss this as a project.
