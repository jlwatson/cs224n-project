This is the flaw that you exhibit. There is nothing but socialism without property rights. This is it, there are types of non-wealth, but the only means we have had to create value has come from property rights.

There is also no new capitalism. There is a freer capitalism, but no anarchist system that does not involve institutions.

So, do tell? How do you manage property without courts? Without institutions? Rothbardian systems are the most liberal of libertairan systems and these incorporate courts and other forms of institutions.

The trouble, utopia does not work. There is no universal good.
