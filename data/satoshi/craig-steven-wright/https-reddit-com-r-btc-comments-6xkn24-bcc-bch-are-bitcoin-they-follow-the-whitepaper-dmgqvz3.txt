No, I have 1 PhD and 1 Professional Doctorate and I plan to start my 2nd PhD and hence 3rd doctorate in Oct.

A professional Doctorate is equal to a PhD and is basically superceeded into just a PhD in most Universities now, but saying I have 2 PhDs is technically incorrect - I have two doctorates. 

Both allow the use of the nomenclature Dr.
