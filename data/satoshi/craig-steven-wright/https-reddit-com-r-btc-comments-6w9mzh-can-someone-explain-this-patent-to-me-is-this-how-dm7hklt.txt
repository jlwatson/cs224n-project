If you want to defensively use any technology you simply write a blog post. You do not spend money on patent lawyers.

As soon as it is published on as little as a blog no other can patent it. 

So when you hear of patents for "defensive or other purposes" know this mrans anything they feel is worth doing.

Anyone Who tells you a patent is purely defensive has lied. Defense is a simple published blog post at no cost.

Stop falling for the lies and propaganda and try to think.
