I am working and writing papers and more. I care about my research and work. I am coming to learn that what others think does not mean more than a pool of piss. 

I have a loving wife, a family and a few trusted friends. I will never need to care about anything again. I am getting my 2nd car where the doors open vertically and I get time off to see places I never did before.

Yes, we should move on and make bitcoin into what it can become.
