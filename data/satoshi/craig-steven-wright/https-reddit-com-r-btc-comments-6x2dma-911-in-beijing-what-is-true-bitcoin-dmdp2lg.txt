Property is not free. That is what rights are. These are not the blockchain, they are things on top of it - some are things people stated are impossible... So, as they are impossible, they did not try. I did and we solved them...

So, as a consequence, we have a right to decide how some are used. 

I have a lot of Bitcoin and a good deal of Fiat. That also in some logic makes it less free as I can compete where others cannot. Should I just give it all away?
