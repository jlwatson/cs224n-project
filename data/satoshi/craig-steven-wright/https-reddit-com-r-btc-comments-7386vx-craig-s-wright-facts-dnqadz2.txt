Ummm so your evidence is a story. Oh right. You claim all that guy wrote that suits you is fact yet the rest is false. :)

You do understand what cherry picking means?

Yet you select information from an author as truth when it suits and false when it suits... 

You realise that my still being at nChain in the same position counters the same argument? Or is that too difficult for you to grasp?

You are so desperate. :)
