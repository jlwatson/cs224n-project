A pledge is enforceable if it is a legally binding contract. 

A legally binding contract exists when there is agreement between the parties and there has been “consideration” given in exchange for the pledge. These are known as the three essential elements of a contract. If any one of the three is missing, the contract is invalid and unenforceable.

This is a pledge to the world without consideration. As stated. It is worth less than used toilet paper.
