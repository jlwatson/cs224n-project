Yes, this is not "my" methodology. It derives from a field of mathematics known as percolation theory. It is a part of statistical physics and mathematics and was a topic that I have both taught and studied. So, I can gladly direct people to it.

Some references are listed below. There are many more, but I have a car coming and I am on my way to Paris, so this will have to wait. Sorry.
 
It is a well-defined science already and Einstein’s Nobel was for one aspect of this, Brownian motion. 

I guess my greatest talent (as many state) is not coming up with things that are completely new, but in using the range of tools available. I have a paper in for peer review as well as a few others coming that cover the topic when applied to Bitcoin. But I am glad to be able to point others towards the topic in order for them to discover more.
