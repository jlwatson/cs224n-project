I am sorry, what is ambiguous if you take the time to read it and not make assumptions or just read a headline?

Where do I make a claim that this is a signature? That was an assumption, not a good one.

That is the issue. Others place expectations on me and think that means they get what they seek. It is a real shame that it is not and no long will ever be the case.

What you do not see is that I am no longer in a position to care. The value of Bitcoin is such that I will not ever need to worry :)
