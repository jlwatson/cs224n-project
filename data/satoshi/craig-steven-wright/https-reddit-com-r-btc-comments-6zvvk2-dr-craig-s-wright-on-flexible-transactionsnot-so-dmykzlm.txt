I am not adverse. One thing Tom will need to start to consider is that he will need to convince a large percentage of the mining hash rate on BCC. 

I will not detail much for now, but this means that he will need to sell me on his idea or it would not occur. It is not a simple change and I have not seen any benefit that cannot be achieved in simpler ways and for less but I have seen many costs. Now and later.
