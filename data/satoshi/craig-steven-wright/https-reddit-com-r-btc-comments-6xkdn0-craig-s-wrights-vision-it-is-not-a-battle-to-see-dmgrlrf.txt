On that note. Do you know what 500,000 Sig ops a second is? That is what 20k USD buys.

It is  Visa, Mastercard, The New York Stock Exchange, 20,000 global banks, Swift, the Fed, and all but the dark OTC pools handled on a business quality server...

Compare that to 30 a second limited by Core. Then tell me if 20k (and this goes down logistically every year in cost) is worth it?
