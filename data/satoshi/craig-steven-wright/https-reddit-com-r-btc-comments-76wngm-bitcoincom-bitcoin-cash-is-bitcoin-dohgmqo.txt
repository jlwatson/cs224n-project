Oh, I am not stating you said the paper needs to be changed. 

You believe a claim. That is at best a prediction. You do not believe BCC will succeed. That is your decision.

It does not have anything to do with what the majority will say.

I say that BCC will be the highest rate of hash and take over to wear the mantle. That can be taken with a grain of salt, but at the same time, I say this is what will happen. Not as a belief in the way you state, but through what is my knowledge. I could be wrong. There may be 20 Exa Hash hidden out there I do not know about. Many (and not all) things are possible.

If that last point is not something I am wrong about, then I am correct in my assertion and it matters naught to try and sell you. The idea is not one based on what the "community" think, but on hash power.

Only time will tell to validate what I have stated.
