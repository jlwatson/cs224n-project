Again, you make claims and add nothing. You simply dismiss maths and say it does not matter. You state that miners do not cluster (which goes against evidence and maths) and your claim about LN is simply false. You go via several hops and thus it is not 1 hop.

Have a nice life. I have wasted enough on you and the trolling.
