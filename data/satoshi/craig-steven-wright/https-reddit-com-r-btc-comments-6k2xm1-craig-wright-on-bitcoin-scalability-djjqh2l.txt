I am likely the most overqualified individual, but that does not make me the best at all areas. 

Bitcoin ideals are libertarian.

They are companies competing. Property rights and only defensive aggression. And you are right. They should be no authority. People should be judged on the ideas they bring. Each idea for its merits. Best is a subjective measure. I cannot respond to that nor do I think that I should. I am certainly not the best coder, the best pen tester, the best at any one thing.

My skills come from having a wide range of skills and a mastery of several.That makes me not the best, but a bridge able to tie many disciplines. My skill is that I know what the aspects of several disciplines are and how they relate and the economics of competing systems.

That allows me to use the best people in the creation of teams that deliver more than I could hope to do alone.
