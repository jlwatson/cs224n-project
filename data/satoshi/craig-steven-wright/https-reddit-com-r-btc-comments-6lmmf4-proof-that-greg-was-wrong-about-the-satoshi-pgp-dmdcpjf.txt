Well. Here is your flaw. Your assumptions are that this is a benifit tax wise. It is not. Claiming to have a capital gain means tax... not anything else. There is a cost in that claim and not a benifit.

You assume investors based on that. Again false.

You assume that the only proof is public. You assume I care any more or want to have your adoration. So many errors in your assessments....

Harming society.... how? You have this story in your mind it seems. Such a shame people do not think....
