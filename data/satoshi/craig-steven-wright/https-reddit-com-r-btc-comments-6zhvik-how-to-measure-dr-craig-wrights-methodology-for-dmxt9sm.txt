We will be starting to come into the light soon and by this in the coming weeks. A lot of what we are doing is to enable others. We are building an SDK and a Compiler to simplify the creation of tools in the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

A good deal of the community will be confused for some time. We are not seeking funding, not raising an ICO, not planning an IPO. We are larger than Blockstream now or ever thought that they could be and growing. We have no government contracts and we are already a small multi-national. 

To those with the tin hats, this is a source of fear. We are not here to encourage this, but at the same time, we have our privacy. This is the hypocrisy in all of this. They expect my response, they call for disclosure in one breath and their own privacy in another. This hypocrisy is the contradiction that destroys their case and leaves their position baseless. 

A lot of opportunities are about to open up. I think that you can say, there are more things about to occur than you can imagine.
