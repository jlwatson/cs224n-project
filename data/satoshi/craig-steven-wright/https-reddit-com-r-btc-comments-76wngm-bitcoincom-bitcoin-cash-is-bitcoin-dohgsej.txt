In 12 months this will be over one way or another and no signing will change what is to be. If I did or did not, nothing would end differently for the better. Some things could be worse.

Do ideas mean more than the messenger or is the truth what is delivered by a charismatic speaker?

Is this what it has all come to?

What now makes a difference is a cult of the individual. Not ideas. Not code and not what will be coming in the following months, but who.

If this is the world that must be, I have to state that I do not want to be a part of it. I do not see that this is. I see that ideas can still sway people, that others will look past petty rivalries and to maths and science and code.

This will end for better or for worse based on ideas. This can be attacked now. We have not shown even 1% of what we are building yet and only a few have even seen the start of what nChain is doing and those parties are not talking publicly. 

Standing up for what you believe in is not being an accomplice to a crime. Folding and caving to the whims of others is.
