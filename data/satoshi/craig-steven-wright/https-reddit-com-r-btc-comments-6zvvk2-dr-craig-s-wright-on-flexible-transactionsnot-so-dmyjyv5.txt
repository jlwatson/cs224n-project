Well, the first issue would be that you are seeking change. You seek to promote this as a benefit without ascribing anything of substance. 

That is in itself an issue.

As I have been stated, you see to have something that makes removing signatures simpler. Your quotes earlier. You seek to make soft forks easier. You also. Both are problematic.

You seek change, radical alterations that are not compatible. Show why this outweighs the costs... Oh, that would mean adding the costs....
