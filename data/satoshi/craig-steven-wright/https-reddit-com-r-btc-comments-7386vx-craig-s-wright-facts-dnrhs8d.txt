Mr Stolfi has a very very long history of opposing Bitcoin.

He is anti about all it stands for and yet trolls away on here. He think s that as he is a Prof in a Brazilian Uni this means he has the right knowledge and ability to determine all topics.

Troll away. All you manage is to get my message to more people.
