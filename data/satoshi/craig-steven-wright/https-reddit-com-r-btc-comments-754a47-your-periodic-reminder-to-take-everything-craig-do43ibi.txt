Yes. I did not react well. He purported to be an academic and yet he based his attack on Bitcoin on a fraud and lies.

I do not take well to false claims as to Bitcoin being insecure. 

I let my anger get the better of me. I should have just walked as soon as he started the lies.

It is my pasdion for bitcoin that gets me every time.

They wanted to write on how flawed bitcoin is. Instead they got me.
