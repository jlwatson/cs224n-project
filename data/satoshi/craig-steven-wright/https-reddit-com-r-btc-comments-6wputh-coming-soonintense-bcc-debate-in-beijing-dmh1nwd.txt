I know a better way, I can team up with those who are masters of this and pool talent.

On that point I do sadly agree. My ability to market even myself is terrible. Marketing was never my forte. In my past I did get to know a lot of people with the skills I lack and cannot grasp. Maths and marketing are not a good combo. So, I have been reaching out to those people and some of them are masters in this. Core are good at propaganda, but they are not masters of marketing. 

If they were, and they placed a 1/10th of the effort into building Bitcoin as they do trying to grasp power, we would have a user base of 100s of millions if not already billions today. 

I understand and appreciate the advice and I also have to say I did marketing as a part of my Masters in Management. I passed as I can understand the theory, but I could never get a hold of it in practice. I know enough to leave the things I cannot do to others and to work as a team. That is what is going to happen.
