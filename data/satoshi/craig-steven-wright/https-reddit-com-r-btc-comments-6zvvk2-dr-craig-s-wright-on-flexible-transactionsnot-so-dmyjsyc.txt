Ad hominem tu quoque (literally: "You also") refers to a claim that the source making the argument has spoken or acted in a way inconsistent with the argument.

So, no Tom this is not Tu quoque

Circumstantial ad hominem points out that someone is in circumstances such that they are disposed to take a particular position. 

No, again, not so.

Guilt by association can sometimes also be a type of ad hominem fallacy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.

And no.

So, Tom, again you are not pointing to benefits, you are associating technical tools as benefits. This is not the same thing.
