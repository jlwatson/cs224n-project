No, the paper defined this very succinctly:

"We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures"

SegWit is not a chain of signatures, it is a chain of hashes related to a signature. This is a vastly different system.

So, we have the electronic coin (not electronic settlement system) with the longest chain that is formed using a chain of digital signatures as the true Bitcoin, there is only one of these.

It is Bitcoin Cash.
