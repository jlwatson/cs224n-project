"A single market buy with 2364.45 BTC"
Oh Greg... OTC.

We HAVE been buying. But, as you thought, I am an incorrigible businessman. We want to get as low as you want to drop it right now. You see, there are things coming and the end is to leave you holding the bag, well not you as you have so little, but those who supported you.

Do you think they will be happy? When they discover in a few months what has been going on? Did you guys not understand that for every buyer there is a seller and that we are from the gaming industry. You know... Poker.

This has been a long game and you have failed to see the bluff can also hide a strong hand.

This is becoming so much fun.
