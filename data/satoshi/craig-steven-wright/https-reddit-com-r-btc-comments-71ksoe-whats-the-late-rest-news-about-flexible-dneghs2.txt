Tom, it is not an ad hominem if it is true and it is also not if it is relevant.

You do not address (nor seem to understand) what consumer and merchant issues are. You do not address adoption nor growth. 

You push a "solution" to a "problem" that is neither a solution nor a problem and use FUD and the other issues to blow this into something it is not. 

Not one part of that is ad-hominem. I suggest that you learn your logical fallacies.
