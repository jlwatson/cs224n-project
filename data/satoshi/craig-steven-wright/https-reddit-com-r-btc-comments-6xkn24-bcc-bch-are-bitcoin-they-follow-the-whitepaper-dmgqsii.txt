Oh and a Masters in Law.
And I am a Banker... I did qualify.
And Economics. 
And Physics (UG)
And Statistics (Masters)
And 5 Computer Science Degrees
And Applied Maths

I could go on. That immodest enough for you.

But yes, another strawman false dichotomy attack. I have a degree in theology... so that means I cannot also have degrees in law, finance, maths, statistics, economics, etc...

So, what about Luke... At least I am not mad in my meta views
