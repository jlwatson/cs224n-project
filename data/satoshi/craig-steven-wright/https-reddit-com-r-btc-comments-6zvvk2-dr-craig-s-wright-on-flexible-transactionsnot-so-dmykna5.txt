No Tom, this is all cost benefit and you are not showing either. You have not made a single real point for FT.  You simply fail to sell the radical change you want. You seek to make your name but to do this, you need to sell the benefits and that is where it all falls apart. 

The benefits are limited at best and the costs far outweight them.  Mostly, it is irrelevant.
