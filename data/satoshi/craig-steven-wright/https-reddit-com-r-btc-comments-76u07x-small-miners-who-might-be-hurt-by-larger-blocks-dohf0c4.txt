I did. Many times. It stated that miners are nodes. 

Fees you give nodes (aka miners)

and

https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin/blob/92ee8d9a994391d148733da77e2bbc2f4acc43cd/readme.txt#L30

And I always thought this was clear:
"// Nodes collect new transactions into a block, hash them into a hash tree,
// and scan through nonce values to make the block's hash satisfy proof-of-work
// requirements.  When they solve the proof-of-work, they broadcast the block
// to everyone and the block is added to the block chain.  The first transaction
// in the block is a special one that creates a new coin owned by the creator
// of the block."

You mean that source code?

Or the readme.txt files that stated this before Core deleted or altered the comments?

Seems that you are being a little disingenuous again Luke.
