If you are not mining, what is the point. 

The lie is that a non mining node has any effect, it does not. Bitcoin is not a random scale free network. It is a near complete small world. 

So, the lie is that you have an impact at all. The reality is that the network distance is a d=1.32 range and miners have 99.8% of TXs in under 2 seconds and the so called full nodes in 40+ seconds. The result is that non mining nodes react after the game is over.
