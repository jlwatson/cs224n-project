The timezone argument is also flawed. But I shall not go there other than to show that Contra's claim is bunk.

The Timezones for Visto mail are Panama and Malaysia.

The sending times do not relate to the US as was claimed. This would place a majority of posts and code builds between the hours of 1am and 3am. Your assumption is also flawed as to time. 

You also assume my location... strange how you spend so much time trying to make people not want o look :)

You do know other than living here now, I have ties to the UK in other wa=ys..
