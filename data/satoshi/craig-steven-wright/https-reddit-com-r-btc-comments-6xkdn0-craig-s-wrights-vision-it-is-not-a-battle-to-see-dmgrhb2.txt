I support Bitcoin, but wait, you will see a series of attacks and false arguments as to why a fork cannot occur. We will hear lies as to the growth of network speed (it doubles yearly and faster than Moore's law) and storage (15 monthly and again at a rate greater than Moore's law).

The end will be a blocking of even a minor 2Mb. 

SegWit is not economically competitive if it cannot be forced into existence through artificial means and economic blockades. 

By November, I think you will see a different world.
