I should have done that way back. It would have made things easier, but then who is to tell the future. 

It mattered what people were saying back then. I have a Chinese family (wife's side) and kids. So, when the claims came out, I did not handle them well. I have learnt. However, I really never expected the lies about my life to become a meme. 

The idea of my degrees being false. I do understand that I am an outlier. 17 degrees is to say the least unusual. It is not the record by the way.  

What I will state is simple. I was mining in 2009 and I research Bitcoin. I have no more to offer than that and I do not care that some dislike that or my political views and ideas.
