The idea that you give up as it is not a pure solution is flawed. I am a realist. In what we are able to achieve in Bitcoin, there will be major changes globally in coming years.

I will not sit back and allow these opportunities to be lost to fiat just as ideals of a perfect market do not fit the ideas of others. 

I would love a true free market, but whilst it is not a reality, I operate in the rules we have and seek to create a system that alters this.

A part of this is not allowing Visa and MC into the act. So, it is a market and people will decide, but for now, what we do with out patents will be out choice and I will not see them given to certain uses.
