And yes, I have 17 earned degrees and they are real. I have dropped out of 5 degrees. One was only a month from graduation, but as if that matters in my case.

Your claim to misleading evidence is how this works. You do not check anything and you make false claims and assumptions.

So where in that page is the claim?
