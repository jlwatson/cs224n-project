nChain alone has over 50 staff in the UK. There are more in the associated entities that are not know publicly yet.

These are people with PHDs and people who have worked in large banks and large sites (Netflix level) - so, we will stick with the really good engineers and not care what others think in the community about these others.

I consider many of these "The Best". They just do not jump into the media and like to work without the attention.
