You really have no idea how this works do you? Capital gains is 51% in Australia. The rebate is 33%. That leaves a differential of a large amount. So, what you are claiming is that I claimed an amount of Bitcoin and equipment in order to pay a larger amount of tax... That is a rather interesting theory... I wonder how insane a person would be to listen to that idea? 


Who are they? I would be interested in meeting them...

There were no investors when I started the companies in Australia. I guess that you did not know that either. 

How easy it is just to make up things without evidence... This is what you claim I have done, and yet here you are. No proof. Not a shred of evidence, just claims. Not one of them founded. Just that you expect me to prove to you... Not as I want something, but as you want to know.

Sorry. Fark off ;)
You deserve no answers. All you get is that I have money, it is not from Gov and I am here like it or not.
