I can sign a message to say this is me, but what does this prove. PGP, Bitcoin etc are not identity based systems. 

Keys can be transferred and exchanged. What proof is holding a key? Even if I set an account up, I could pay another to answer. Is that me or another?

I see that few understand this.
