Yes, those are the Bitcoin network.

It would seem that the maths is above most people involved in Bitcoin. We have been starting the process to share this data and information with a number of universities. There are too few real mathematicians involved with Bitcoin and I hope that opening the methods and materials to universities for post grad projects will start to build the needed skills as well as allowing for the wide dissemination of this data on how Bitcoin really works. 

As a teaser, it is not how people think. 

It is not a mesh nor even close to it.
