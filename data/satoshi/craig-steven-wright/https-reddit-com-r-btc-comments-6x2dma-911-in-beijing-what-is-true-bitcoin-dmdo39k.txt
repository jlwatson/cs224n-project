I am me and if anyone wants to try and make this more or less than I give freely, I will make their lives more or less fun :)

I am not interested in people who try and attribute lies to me or to dig where I do not offer them to dig.

I am also no longer phased. We will have 225 patents filed this year. You can like or not like patents and you can like or not like what is coming... Vote with your funds. It is that simple. That is what Bitcoin is about. 

Not a democracy as some like to believe, an economic system based on a non credit exchange. Many will not like this and fewer will like what this entails. Such is life.
