So, please inform me as to what expert testimony as to my addresses you would offer?

Being that I never claimed a loss for Mt Gox, I find that strange to say the least. What fraud is this you are proposing and how is it you would have any knowledge of any of it without a former involvement.

Clearly someone instigated the search warrant for a Satoshi Nakamoto with the ATO? I would love to know who that was as I had never claimed to be that person to that organisation and have no benefit in doing so.
Again, I would be interested in what expert testimony you could provide?
