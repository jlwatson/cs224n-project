In fact. That is the entire point of a licence.  It can be revoked. 

Microsoft can and have revoked licenses at later points in time. They update licences and require that you accept the new terms or stop use all the time.

That is what a license is. A limited right to use at the owners discretion and within selected legal bounds. It is not an open property assignment.  Stop falsely telling people that this is what it is.

You can have a license revoked. The BS license can be revoked at their pleasure. The effect is that tgey can lure others to use their flawed and oversold tech only to move the goalposts and charge for use. There is absolutely nothing defensive in that license.

Your deception is simple. A slight of hand. What you deflect by throwing  accusations. What you say is a reason why my argument should be ignored. You simply spout false trash and use ad hominem.
