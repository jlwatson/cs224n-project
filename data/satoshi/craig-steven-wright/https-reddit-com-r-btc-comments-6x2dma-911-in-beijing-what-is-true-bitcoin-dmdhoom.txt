No and yes. I am OK now, but it is not what I wanted. I really liked. My past was in a nice suburban neighbourhood. I enjoyed the anonymity. It was nice having money and not fitting in but just being ignored.

It is not possible to change the past. It was not something I planned nor expected. Dec 15 caught me off guard. It should not have, but I was complacent. We ended having guards and people as body guards around the clock. It was not something I enjoyed.

So, as for identified, well the past is the past and that is something that cannot be changed. In the coming months we are releasing and publishing. There are 19 patents any day and a series of peer reviewed papers. So, it is not as if I have the luxury of complete anonymity. 

That said, I am starting to learn that there are other benefits from money. You do not travel the same way and there are so many things that are better.
