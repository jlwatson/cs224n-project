Again, this is a cost benefit issue. It does not mean a thing for a home user. 

It does for a miner. Here in the UK, I have a 1GB fibre line. My US latency to Google is 1 ms over the theoretical minimum that is allowed using the speed of light.

Companies in competition will use the lowest cost infrastructure they can that delivers a profit. A merchant just needs to validate a TX and that can be done as a separate function in less than Square or Visa do now.
