I had originally submitted my thesis in 2012 . This was 340 pages longer. I cut this to 450 pages in 2013 and finally to a little over 300 pages in 2014 before that submission. 

I also needed to do a lot of external (not presented in the thesis) justification. I argue that Akerlof's market for lemons is flawed. It is, horribly so. In time, I will publish the data I used to have others accept my thesis as is, but there are other things first to complete. 

The idea that security and risk are economic functions is not something many in the industry like or accept. I can and have demonstrated it empirically, but this goes against the ingrained ideals of many IT security and risk people. They seek perfection, not probability and economic optimisation.
