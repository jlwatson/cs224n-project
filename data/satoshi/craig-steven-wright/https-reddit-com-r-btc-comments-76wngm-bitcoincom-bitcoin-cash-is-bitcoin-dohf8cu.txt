Sorry, this is not how the world works. 

You do not get to redefine Newton's laws as you think they could be better.  The inventor sets what something is and then it remains.

The "community" whoever they may be (and they are more a group with more ties to Alts than Bitcoin now) can use the code, they can alter the code, but the cannot alter the whitepaper.

As much as you may feel you have a right, you do not.
