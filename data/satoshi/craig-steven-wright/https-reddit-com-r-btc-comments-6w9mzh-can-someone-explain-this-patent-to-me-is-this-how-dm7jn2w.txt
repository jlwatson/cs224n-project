In order to patent you need to have the eariest filing date. So your counter is a strawman. You do not fight otger patents in this manner. That is a media myth.

To patent an invention it takes a minimum of 12 to 18 months for the PCT. 

To write a blog... less than the patent. Publish the patent in any form. You stop all other patents. 

These Defensive patent pledges are not covenants. They are marketing and have no legal probitive value. They have one reason to exist. To fool the gullible into believing they are altruistic. 

No. You cannot do as you say. All you are stating is that you start enforcing licensing and that is not the scaple you make it to be.

The DPL is simple... any purpose. The only legal tetm that matters is the widest use. In their document it states "or any other purpose".

It is not defensive. This is a benifit of having an LLM in international commercial law with a PG Diploma specialty in intellectual property law. You see through the deception.

Yes. I have patents filed. The Distinction is I am honest about it. Blockstream are not. 

No. The lies they state about my qualifications are just that. Lies and deception. In this instance my LLM is with commendation from Northumbria University Newcastle in the UK.
