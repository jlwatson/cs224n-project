One little problem. The source of the document and why it existed.

It is not proof of Satoshi. It is just proof of a large number of Bitcoin. More I do not have to say and nor will I. 

The largest flaw is simple. 

I was involved in a case against the ATO in court and the AAT between 2009 and 2012. I won as the Tax office settled. The creation of the Trust, the companies and more came as a consequence of the court case and my earlier divorce. 

The simple flaw and it is simple... the trust was submitted into evidence in an Australian Federal court matter. My 2012 included the tax on the gains at the point of mining. The tax was on my return. I lodged an amount of 3.2 million AUD as the gain and paid the correct tax on this amount.

The case involved a company from 2009. It was the first Bitcoin company ever. It was called Integyrs. The Tax office called this a hobby. At that point, 2009, it could have been seen in that way.
