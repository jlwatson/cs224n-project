No, you claim the majority never will, but you do and speak for a majority of people and never will.

As for the other claim. Theymos and Cobra each planned to change the whitepaper. It was and remains a planned change.

Maybe Github?

Being that there IS a change request by Cobra on the Bitcoin.org Git, this shows either you do not follow what is occurring or do not care.

Not about changing the whitepaper... Never said:
"I believe the paper was always designed to be a high level overview of the current reference implementation, and that we should update it now that the paper is outdated and the reference implementation has changed significantly from 2009."

Open your eyes.
