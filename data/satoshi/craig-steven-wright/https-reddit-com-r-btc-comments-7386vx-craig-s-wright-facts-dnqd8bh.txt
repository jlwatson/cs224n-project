Double major. 
The thesis is published on CSU. There is a lot of misinformation. Some here use my decision to not clear all their concerns as proof. A shame for them. My study was of risk, looking at mathematical models derived from the economic costs in information security and audit.

're Wiki.
Yes sort of. I have a professional doctorate in Theology from a study of ancient religion. This is equal to a PhD bit is not exactly the same. I was rather senior in the Uniting Church and was a trustee of their fund and bank.

I enjoy formal study. It relaxes me. Right now, I am finalising an MSc at the University of London. My plan is to do a DLaw (doctor of law) next. Again, a professional doctorate not a PhD.
