No, it refers to Bitcoin. Not SegWitcoin but still even then it would apply.

Basically, you simply seek to avoid fact and argue that Bitcoin needs to be something else. You make claims that do not stand investigation or rigour and then move the goal posts. 

You can state all you will how much Home users running nodes do, but simply, they have not mined (outside a pool) a single block in years and most could not as they do not enable mining at all. 

LN is not 2 hops. There is nothing to argue, it is not the case. I like facts and evidence. Your claims that it is not how Bitcoin is/should be whatever are in error and you can yell about it all you like, it matters naught.

So have a nice life.
