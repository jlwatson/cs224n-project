P2SH is an ugly hack. (SORRY GAVIN).

It is not necessary. It is refund and and we can open more without a protocol change using thresholds. Those things Greg and co. said cannot be done in EdDSA... we have working. That is what we are building when we discuss blinded thresholds.

There are no use cases we cannot do without P2SH and in the original bitcoin protocol minus these changes.

In fact. They are faster. They are more secure. They take less TX space. 

So... p2SH is a kludge.

We will provide something better and ad this is not detectable by miners from a type 1 address... There is no way to stop us rolling it out. Then... use a type 3 at a disadvantage.
