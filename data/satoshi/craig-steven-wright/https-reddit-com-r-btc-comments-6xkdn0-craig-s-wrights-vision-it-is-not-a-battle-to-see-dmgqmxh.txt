The quote was if you have been in Bitcoin since the beginning, that is 2010 then you have a debt to pay.

Nodes mine. They are not the lies that you have been told. Bitcoin is not a scale free network. It is a small world. Learn something.

This is all the power that Core and their shills have. Just lies. They create strawmen from these lies built on half truths. They reword what is said and reproduce things. 

They have created nothing. Delivered nothing or less than nothing and call it victory.
