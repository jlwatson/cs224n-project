As for an appeal to authority... I would have assumed you knew what that meant. Clearly not.

Yours is an appeal to authotity. The Lawyers of tge others must be listened to!!!

No. I am an authority on the topic. The fallacy is a false use of authority.

Logical Form:

According to person 1, Y is true.
Therefore, Y is true.

That IS your argument. Mine is that they have not structured anything to in effect allow a restricted use of their property. A covanent would have done that. Notice tge distinction? You are attempting to use the logical fallacy of authority and then to deflect this in a false attempt to regain lost ground in your argument. 

So no. That from my side is no appeal to authority. It is a logocally valid and cogently constructed arguement yours meanwile is a deceptive rhetorical flourish.

Badically the way Core has spend the prior 3 years. Not delivering code. Attacking competition. 

Shame on you for this.
