George Soros is known as "The Man Who Broke the Bank of England" due to his short sale of US$10 billion worth of Pound sterling. This sale netted him $1 billion USD during the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis.[1]

It worked as Soros signalled his intend stronger than that of the others, that is the central bank. By "inviting" others to make money, he managed to strengthen his own position.

This is not by any means illegal nor a fraud. It is business and those who like SegShit are going to see the light in how BCC scales Bitcoin  or they will find that standing in the tunnel and waiting leads to an altercation with a train.
