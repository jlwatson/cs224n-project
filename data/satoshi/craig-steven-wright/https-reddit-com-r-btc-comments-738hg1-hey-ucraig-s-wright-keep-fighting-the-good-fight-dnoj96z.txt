So... other than your lies.

Which fraud?

That is right... You just make them up. When there is something it is you and other trolls denying truth.

When I do not want to show my degrees you say they are fake. When I prove them to be real you claim I am not humble. Well... on that you are right, no person is honest and humble. But yes... I am working on my 18th. Degree. Do you really think denying that hurts me?

Oh as for your PGP rebuttals... just as false this time as the first. Easy to disprove your claims, but most people are lazy.

Do you think arguing material that was in court as evidence makes a difference.

Here is the thing you will never explain. 

We do not want your investment. 
We are not seeking to list.
Yet we have a runway longer than anyone else.

We invest and we do not need to tell you anything about it. 

Claim. Rant. Cry.

Nothing you do nor say matters.

I am here.
My group is here.

We are forming partnerships with Universities.
We are creating code with corporations.

Bitcoin is money. It is not collectivist. It is not socialist. It is pure capitalist and it was always designed to be. 

We are investing and nothing of it will be public. Nothing needs to be as WE DO NOT NEED YOU.

Find a life. Look at the sun and the sky. Get out. Enjoy life rather than festering and growing fat and lazy in the dark world you call your life.

You are stopping absolutely nothing. If anything, all you have done has helped me.

Have a nice day.
