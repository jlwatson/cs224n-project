You are entitled to your view.

That stated, corporations form as they are efficient. You can state all you like as to what Bitcoin needs, and I cranky do not care. I am a realist first and foremost.

Mostly. I am happy with where I am. So. Please rant away. I will build. I will patent where I choose to. I will give tjose away openly when I decide for the reasons that I decide.

Bitcoin will scale.

It will be used by business. 

If you do not like this, please feel free to run into the woods and hide.

Because we have already started. 5 billion people will have access to money they control and I could not care less about the ideas of those who will stand in the way of this goal.
