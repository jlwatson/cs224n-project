Sorry, where on the Satre page did I say that was proof?

You are the fool as you managed not to read and made assumptions. What a shame.

I claimed nothing from you nor others. I did not desire anything from you. I have all those degrees, yes they are real and yes I have 17 of them including 2 doctorates. Only one is a PhD the other is what is called a professional doctorate. Both allow you to be called Dr. I have more Masters than I care to remember. Yet, I find myself in a series of media posts saying how I have faked these...

What is the shame is that I have to come out and defend any of that. You are not owed proof. I want nothing from you. 

In the past, it was simple to remain a student. I am now and will be a little longer, but I on trying to do a Masters, I was rejected as "Over qualified" - something that is now a response in having to have shown all my degrees, in the past, I could apply to university with only a subset. 

So, we have over 200 patents that will be completed this year and more than that for papers. If you do not like it, well, that makes no difference to me at all.
