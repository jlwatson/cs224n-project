So Greg (/u/nullc).

How about we show the world the money. How about I fly you over here to Europe. Business of course, I would not skimp.

We will setup a debate. You can try and "prove" I am a fraud. I will show and prove more qualifications than you have years on earth that I have achieved. We will have this recorded, at our expense. Marketed, at our expense... 

You do understand how much this sort of thing costs right? Not just running troll armies...

We will fly Roger and others out as well.(/u/Memorydealers) 

I will provide some empirical data and other material and you can yell and scream that it is fake as we also have it scientifically verified. 

I do know that you hate how I am about to start on my 11th post grad degree, then, this is a little envy right? That is a shame. You did manage to bring out my worst, I give you that. However, you do not get that anymore. You do not matter. 

So, shall I personally pay your time for this debate as well? Not the company, me.

What say you?
