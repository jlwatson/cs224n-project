And Tom, I know that you say this. 

However, you have not modelled the network.
You have not worked on competing distribution models.
I have looked at some of what you what written, and the model is for a mesh based system, so, as much as you want to say there are no assumptions, there are.

In the simplest form, we all work on assumptions. It is only in Pure Mathematics that assumptions can be removed. 

In science, you are deluding yourself and others if you do not admit and relate your assumptions. All scientific research is based on assumptions.
