In addition to all the SANS courses and certifications I have Cisco, juniper and many more. In all cases, I know of MANY people more skilled in any one area than I am.

What I do is collect knowledge. 

I do not have 18 masters degrees.

I have 17 degrees and I am in the last legs (I finish Oct) of another master to make a total of 18. I have 1 professional doctorate and one PhD, these have been verified. My total of masters degrees will be 10 after this.

I have started and dropped out of 7 degrees for various reasons. 

I have the other qualifications as undergrad.

With all that, I am not the most heavily degree'd individual. There is a person here in the UK with 31 degrees. People can seek knowledge for knowledge sake.
