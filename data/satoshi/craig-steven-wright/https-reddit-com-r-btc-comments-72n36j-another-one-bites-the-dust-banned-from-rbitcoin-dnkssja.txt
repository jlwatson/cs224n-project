We (nChain and affiliated companies) are planning (have started) investing is many groups. We want to and are helping fund BU, we want to and are discussing the funding of ABC, etc.

In creating a competitive environment, we all benefit. 

If core wants to say that is control, we can do little to stop this in the rBitcoin world. That said, the best way is to be involved and ensure that development is robust and that you have a say.

We did not add conditions. We invested in projects and we will keep doing this. The Gigabyte Test net is a project that is necessary. Not just to validate our own internal work, but to have Bitcoin groups see how much Bitcoin can scale, onchain.

The offers to add documentation and specify the protocol such that others can compete - is necessary.

Development NEEDS to become decentralised. It is not through a collective that we thrive as humans, it is when we are individuals in healthy competition. Not war, not aggression, but friendly rivalry.

This is what we hope to encourage.
