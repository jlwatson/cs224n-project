The problem is being misunderstood. 

The issue is not the halting problem, that is not solved, but what you can do on a decider is run a program that must end and has been tested to end. The form of machine is known as a Decider (Sipser) or a TTM (Total Turing Machine).

There is no need to change anything in script now to do this but it would be better with:
 - Increased space,
 - More Sig Ops
 - Fixing and re-enabling the Script primitives that are disabled
