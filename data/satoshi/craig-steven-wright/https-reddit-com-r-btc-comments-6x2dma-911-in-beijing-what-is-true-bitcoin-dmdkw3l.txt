I think that Dec 15 should never have happened. So, what is believed will be what is. 

The general assumption is that I seek investors or something else. That is simply false and you also do not make money long term being a name and not having something more. 

What I want is for people to move on from the myth. It is time to professionalise and that is not a religious thing. Sn was never what people made him and nor is the idea of Bitcoin in many ways. There was never any socialist bent and nor was it altruistic... Money never is.

I am acting as me, what you take from that is your decision. If you think that you can be an investor just as Satoshi is the founder of the scheme, then you are not anyone I would like to deal with. Not that I am seeking investors...
