No, you have your keys, but those keys are also the same for may other things if you like (not recommending this here).

You own keys that allow access to validate an entry on a ledger.

That system is Bitcoin IFF it fulfils the requirements to be Bitcoin.

I also said much more than that single line. To quote myself, So, we have the electronic coin (not electronic settlement system) with the longest chain that is formed using a chain of digital signatures as the true Bitcoin, there is only one of these.

Now, that does not mean it si not also other things. Saying a Cat is a mammal does not state more than what is required for it to be a mammal. It does state a set of defined baselines that are not able to be breached. If the female of the species in general does not produce milk, it is not a member of the class mammal. There are other parts to any class, but for bitcoin, that is a base state.

The keys alone mean little. These are what secures your coins, but they also could simply be a set of SSH keys that would in the end also map to a Bitcoin address.
