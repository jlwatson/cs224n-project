Sorry. You have the wrong material. 

There is a good analysis of this that is presented here:

Turing's original paper was:
A. Turing, On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the
Entscheidungsproblem, Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society
42 (1937), 230â€“65.

You are linking a later set of lectures. 

Then this was never about having the truth told for you was it?
