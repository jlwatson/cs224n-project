Basically. EFF link something... that is your sole arguement. Not it is worthless and easily revoked being shown to have a flaw. It is easily revoked.

Not it is a license to do whatever they like and. Not a covenant but ignore this... Microsoft have licences. To which you decieve others trying to say how even Microsoft cannot change a licence. MS changes their licence all the time.

They can alter or revoke at will. It is that simple. The license is worth less than used toilet paper and the tech they patent even less than that.

SegShit is a way to force others to use their patented crap and maintain power through force. 

That simple. 

No sane nor rational person would use those patents other than through force and that is the game here.
