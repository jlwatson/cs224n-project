Double spend by miners... Yes, I can see a multi million $ site engaged in a double spend. This make complete economic sense...

Why build a business and make money when you can steal a can of coke?

The issue is that you are conflating the past of where miners where and the economic reality. This is the most common issue with "security" and risk people, they fail to understand that ALL security and risk is economic in nature.
