Anonymous, communications are not the only, or even main way to learn about
the existence of a culture. (Notice that I didn't even mention SETI's failure
to find radio signals as evidence). Surface engineering follows a very
different trend -- the better engineered surfaces are (and optical properties
are typically the most important surface properties), the more unnatural they
look.
