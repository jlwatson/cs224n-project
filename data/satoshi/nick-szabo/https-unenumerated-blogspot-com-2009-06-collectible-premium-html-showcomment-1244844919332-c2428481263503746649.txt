I just thought of a hypothesis to explain the odd dramatic movement in stock
price/earning (PE) ratios with respect to inflation. (See the link to S&P 500
percentage earnings, the inverse of PE ratio, that Devin pointed us to, here).
The lower expected inflation, the more the better expected cash flow from
stocks weighs against the better protection from inflation provided by
housing, commodities, precious metals, and collectibles proper (art, antiques,
etc.). So people over sufficiently long periods (e.g. the reaction is far
quicker for commodities than for housing) alter their overall portfolios to be
much more weighted in stocks and much less weighted in those inflation-
protected assets. This gives stocks what we might call an "inverse collectible
premium" that decreases as inflation expectations rise and increases as they
fall. Thus stock prices don't keep up with inflation even if profits do, and
stock prices perform disproportionately better as expected inflation falls
towards zero.
