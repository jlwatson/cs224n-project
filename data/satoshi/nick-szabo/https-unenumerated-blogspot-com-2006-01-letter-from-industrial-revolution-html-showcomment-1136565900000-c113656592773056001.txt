Those are good theories. My theories are that (1) historians often worked as
propagandists for governments or particular politicians, thus recorded history
is mostly accumulated propaganda; (2) historians and readers of history share
with news media and its readers a bias towards the sensational, such as the
violence and sex of politics; and (3) even when they don't personally share
that bias, they draw from news sources that do.
