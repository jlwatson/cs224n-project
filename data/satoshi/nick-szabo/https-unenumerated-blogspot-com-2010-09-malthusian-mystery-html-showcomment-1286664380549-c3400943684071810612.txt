TGGP, Clark inspired my recent research -- he recognized a crucial question
that I had failed to recognize (the astounding nature and importance of the
Malthusian mystery), and set forth some very interesting data, but IMHO got
most of the answers wrong.  
  
Other than that analogy he basically neglects to account for the horses, which
accounted for much more "horsepower" on farms than either humans or steam by
the latter half of the nineteenth century. The only scholar who appears to
have recognized the crucial role of horses in increasing human labor
productivity is E.A. Wrigley. But otherwise the topic seems to have been sadly
neglected. Instead the industrial revolution has typically been seen as all
about steam (never replaced more than a tiny fraction of horses on farms) and
coal (important in industry but not on farms) and mechanisms (didn't play a
big role in increasingly farm labor productivity until the mid 19th century,
so can't explain the substantial progress in the Malthusian isocline before
that time). This is not to say that there aren't some ways in which the
agricultural revolution benefited from the industrial revolution, but they are
much more subtle. This and some other neglected topics I find central to the
agricultural/industrial revolution I have been researching and hope to cover
in future posts.
