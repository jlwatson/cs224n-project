Meanwhile Timothy B. Lee makes a good argument about how it will probably
always be infeasible to digitally emulate the evolved and analog brain, and
the crucial distinction between simulations (which are and may of necessity
always be woefully incomplete in this area) and emulation (which must be
complete to work). I've clarified and extended his argument as follows:  
  
The most important relevant distinction between the evolved brain and designed
computers is abstraction layers. Human engineers need abstraction layers to
understand their designs and communicate them to each other. Thus we have
clearly defined programming languages, protocol layers, and so on. These are
designed, not just to work, but to be understood by at least some of our
fellow humans.  
  
Evolution has no needs for understanding, so there is no good reason to expect
understandable abstraction layers in the human brain. Signal processing may
substantially reduce the degrees of freedom in the brain, but the remaining
degrees of freedom are still likely to be astronomically higher than those of
any human-understandable abstraction layer. No clean abstraction layers, no
emulation.
