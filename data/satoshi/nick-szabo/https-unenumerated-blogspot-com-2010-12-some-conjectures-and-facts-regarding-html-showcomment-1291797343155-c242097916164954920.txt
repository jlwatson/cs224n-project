The only attempt at a nutrient budget for the agricultural revolution I've
seen: Robert Allen has a computer model of nitrogen sources and consumption. I
haven't tried to get the code or run it, but it looks interesting. However, it
focuses on nitrogen leaving out other important nutrients and neglects some
nutrient-replenishing technologies such as water meadows.
