A new crop of web services  in the U.K. allow you to locate and track people
via their mobile phone. The phone companies themselves, and emergency call
centers, and anybody else authorized, have long been able to do this in the
U.S. and U.K. and elsewhere, but now it's going retail. There is also this
service which at least alerts the trackee when his or her location is being
queried. This partially addresses the attack of borrowing somebody's phone
long enough to "give consent" and then tracking them with the service.  Via
Ian Grigg's Financial Cryptopgraphy.  
  
Counter-intuitively, this development may enhance privacy, since the publicity
that accompanies retail services will help prevent people from being in denial
about the functions of their cell phone. Even if it doesn't enhance privacy in
this manner, it may at least help take us from an Orwellian model of
surveillance (the state behind a one-way mirror) to a Brinian model (peer to
peer surveillance). OTOH, it may just fulfill the daydream of many a boss of
being able to track employees 24x7.
