Notice the resemblance of the British canal networks to the veins in leaves or
an animal circulatory system. Within geographical constraints, this canal
network is close to an optimal space-filling flow network, reaching within
short land distance transport to nearly the entire area, O(n^2). A good
highway/road/street network is similar.
