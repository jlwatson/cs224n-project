This blog is named "Unenumerated" for a variety of reasons, including  
(1) the  Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states the
most basic (but most ignored) law of the United States, namely that our civil
rights, which should be enforced by the courts, are so vast and varied that
they cannot be enumerated, and  
(2) the list of topics for this blog, which is so vast and varied that it
cannot be enumerated.
