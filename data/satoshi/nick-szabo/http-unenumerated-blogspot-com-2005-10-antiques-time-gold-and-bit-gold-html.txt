What do antiques, time, and gold have in common? They are costly, due either
to their original cost or the improbability of their history, and it is
difficult to spoof this costliness. For example, it is usually difficult to
spend an extra hour at the office without sacrificing about an hour of your
personal life.  
  
Unforgeable costliness is a pattern that recurs in many human institutions and
is fundamental to civilization. Modern employment is based on the time-rate
wage. Our monetary system is based on money being made unforgeably costly
either through collectibles, commodity standards, or (in modern fiat
currencies) accounting.  
  
The unforgeable costliness pattern includes the following basic steps:  
  
(1) find or create a class of objects that is highly improbable, takes much
effort to make, or both, and such that the measure of their costliness can be
verified by other parties.  
  
(2) use the objects to enable a protocol or institution to cross trust
boundaries  
  
There are some problems involved with implementing unforgeable costliness on a
computer. If such problems can be overcome, we can achieve bit gold. This
would be the first online currency based on highly distributed trust and
unforgeable costliness rather than trust in a single entity and traditional
accounting controls. Hal Finney has implemented a variant of bit gold based on
a tamper-evident computer plug-in card, for which remote users can verify what
code is running on the card.
