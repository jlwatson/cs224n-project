nazgulnarsil, it doesn't readily come to my mind what conflicts of interest
miners might have with other stakeholders (which I tend to think of as
holders, creditors, and debtors). What biases on their part did you have in
mind? Current Bitcoin or bit gold holders do have a bias towards deflation.
Albeit this historically has not been as big a problem as inflation, they and
creditors do have a conflict of interest with debtors.  
  
Your objection does suggest to me an interesting possible improvement in the
Byzantine agreement security. Instead of, or in addition to, the Byzantine
"voting power in case of civil war" going to those proving work (i.e. the
miners), require that participants sign challenges with their ownership keys
to prove they own solution bits. The behavior of conflicting sending nodes,
when the receiving node can't otherwise distinguish between correct and
incorrect behavior, then gets weighted by the value of solution bits owned by
said sender, either par or market, or similar. With such method one would have
to own most of the money in circulation, rather than just most of the mining
power, to corrupt the system (i.e. to successfully attack the subset of
features that only have a Byzantine rather than cryptographic level of
protection). This would discourage anonymity since doing these signatures and
verifications over many keys would get computationally intensive, but I don't
think strong anonymity is a feasible property in bit gold or Bitcoin anyway.
