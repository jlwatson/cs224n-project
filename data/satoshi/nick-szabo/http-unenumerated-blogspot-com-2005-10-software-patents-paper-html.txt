In my previous entry I mentioned the software patents paper I wrote a few
months ago, and I have now put it online. In this paper I describe how
software came to be patentable in the United States despite the Supreme
Court's holdings that "mathematical algorithms" are unpatentable.  
  
I now reiterate the recommendation I made in the paper: the Supreme Court
should reverse the Federal Circuit's holding in Metabolite based on the
subject matter limitation in 35 U.S.C. 101. It should analyze subject matter
patentability based on the Neilson test as applied in Parker v. Flook and
clarified in the paper.
