David Chaum's dining cryptgraphers network is a nifty alternative to his
digital mix to untraceably share encrypted information. But it suffers from
the problem that since the participants are untraceable, one or more of them
can jam the channel, preventing other participants from having their messages
received. Bryan Turner has figured out a way to find the jammers if they are
less than one-third of the total participants. Presumably this is accomplished
without being able to find out much of anything else interesting about a
participant. I suggest that a similar technique may also work for a jamming
attack in a secure multiparty computation.
