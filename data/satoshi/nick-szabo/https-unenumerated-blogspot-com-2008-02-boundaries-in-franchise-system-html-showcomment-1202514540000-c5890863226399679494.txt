 _I recently moved from Seattle to a suburb as my children grew to school age,
to avoid the socialist nonsense in the Seattle Public Schools._  
  
A great idea, but with state and national programs (e.g. "No Child Left
Behind") this socialism can follow you wherever you go.  
  
And alas, having a family, concentrating social ties within a jurisdiction,
investing in real estate, and many other important activities tie one into a
particular jurisdiction, to the point where many local bureaucrats can count
on these self-imposed Berlin walls to keep the locals under their thumbs.  
  
I don't have great solutions to these dilemmas in mind at the moment, mind
you, I'm just pointing out some very unfortunate barriers to liberty. One good
thing for those of us in the U.S. -- the right of travel and relocation
between states is a fundamental constitutional right here, even if quite
unfortunately the right to leave and return the country itself freely would
probably not be deemed so by courts.
