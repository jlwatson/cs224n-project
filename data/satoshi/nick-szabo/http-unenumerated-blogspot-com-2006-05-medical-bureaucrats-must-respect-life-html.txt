Alex Taberrok writes about a wonderful decision out of the D.C. Circuit. The
court basically held that the FDA is violating the Fifth Amendment (and I'd
add, natural and common law) rights to life and liberty of terminally ill
patients by preventing them from getting drugs for their purpose of saving
their lives unless the FDA has a compelling interest in doing so that
outweighs these rights. Amazingly enough, up until this court's decision one
had a Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right to terminate the life of a fetus (a
right with which I agree) by getting an abortion (or taking an abortion pill)
without the government placing an "undue burden" on these medical procedures,
but no such right under United States law to try to save one's own life with
relatively safe medication.  
  
Here's the court's opinion. I find the court's argument quite compelling, as
it's based on both liberty _and_ life, rather than just pitting one against
the other as in the abortion debate. Alas, despite the compelling argument
this doctrine may have a tough time surviving our current legal positivist
(statutory language can do no wrong, and neither can regulation...) Supreme
Court, not to mention a political environment where most of the planet thinks
that medicine should be centrally planned by state bureaucrats, the patients
be damned.
