For applications like spam resistance using regular (not reusable) POW, your
argument has some weight: to the extent these schemes assume spammers will
exhaust their computing resources before end users, they may prove to be
disillusioned.  
  
But with respect to bit gold, you could make the same argument about gold and
gold mines, and it would also be wrong. There are substantial economies of
scale in gold mining and a handful of corporations are responsible for most of
the world's gold mine output. That doesn't prevent a very competitive market
in gold. (But see my comment on custom hardware below -- that is a scenario in
which your argument has more weight).  
  
For both gold and bit gold the price is determined by supply and demand. For
both Hal's and my scheme the supply is determined by the scarcity at any given
time. In Hal's scheme this is because tokens are turned over sequentially
every time they are used and in my scheme because they are securely time-
stamped. In my scheme later times will usually reflect lower computation costs
and thus trade for a lower price, while in Hal's scheme the difficulty of the
puzzle is gradually increased.  
  
The worst problem, that I indicate in my article, is that somebody could come
up with custom hardware with orders-of-magnitude advantage and possibly gain a
near monopoly over the "mining" market until soembody else figures out a way
to duplicate the hardware. This might or not beat the idea -- the market for
time-stamped POW bits may adjust properly to even such a radical cost
reduction -- but it's an important problem.
