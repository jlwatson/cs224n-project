October 23rd will be the fiftieth anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution. It
was a glorious lost cause; glorious enough that Hungary, and the world, won in
the long run.  
  
The Hungarian American Federation has a great 1956 page. Wikipedia has a good
article. My alma mater happens to have a good collection of historical
documents related to the Revolution, along with an introduction to the events.
Here is an old newsreel that provides a good overview. Even Quentin Tarantino
helped make a movie about the Revolution and a nasty game of water polo.  
  
My dad was one of those students who wouldn't put up with tyranny. Besides
communism being defeated in the end, there was a bright spot for myself and my
siblings in particular: it brought my dad to America to meet my mom, making us
possible. :-) But thousands of Hungarians didn't make it through November.
