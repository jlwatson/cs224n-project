Dennis Crouch has a good review of and links to the petitioner's brief and
several amicus brief in LabCorp v. Metabolite. This case may impact the
patentability of software and business methods. I have described in a paper
how software came to be patentable in the United States, when our Supreme
Court has held "mathematical algorithms" to be unpatentable subject matter.
