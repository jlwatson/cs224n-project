BTW, one flaw I suspect might occur is that each jury, not constrained by
having to fit its franchise's budget into an overall budget, and influenced by
it's franchise's PR to believe that its franchise solves The Most Urgent and
Important Problem on Our Planet -- each jury will tend to overfund its
particular franchise, since it represents only a small fraction of what the
juror will pay in taxes.  
  
Suggestions for solving this problem? I have some vague notion that there will
be a "defense" at a "trial" arguing to the jury that the franchise's fees
should be lowered, but I'm not sure who would be motivated to fund such a
defense -- perhaps some of the companies regulated by the franchise. I don't
want getting fee raises to be as easy for a franchise as getting a grand jury
to indict the proverbial ham sandwich.
