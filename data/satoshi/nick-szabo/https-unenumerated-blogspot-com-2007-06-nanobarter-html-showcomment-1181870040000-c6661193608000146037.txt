"anonymous", I'd be quite interested in more detail about what you tried to
implement and how it compares to what I have proposed. I read quite a bit of
the MN documentation and don't recall seeing anything strongly resembling what
I have proposed. I am not at all convinced that what you tried and what I have
proposed are the same thing. There is a vast design space here, and I am
extremely skeptical of any suggestion that your team explored more than a tiny
fraction of it.
