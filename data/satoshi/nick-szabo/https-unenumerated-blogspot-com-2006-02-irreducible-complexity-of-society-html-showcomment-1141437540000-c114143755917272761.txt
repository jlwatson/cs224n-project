I should also point out that logical depth also often creates severe limits to
feasible understanding. Indeed, the limits of logical depth to create
intractible complexity may be more important limits to understanding,
especially to understanding other minds, than the limits of ultimately
irreducible (Kolmogorov-Solomonoff-Chaitin) complexity.  
  
Mathematically, the inability to crack a cipher is almost entirely a matter of
logical depth -- the keys themselves are only hundreds or thousands of bits.
In the physical world, there are many chaotic phenomenon that act like a
cipher and blow up a small amount of ultimately irreducible complexity into a
vast amount of intractible complexity: for example the proverbial butterfly
flapping its wings which can ultimately and unpredictably change the direction
of a future hurricane. Indeed, the always limited and relative ability of
human minds and computers to play the penny matching game I mentioned is
probably more a matter of logical depth than ultimately irreducible
complexity.
