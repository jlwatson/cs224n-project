I've written an article on my application of the principle of least authority
to the interpretation of legal language. I argue that the United States
Constitution, according to its original meaning, instructs judges to construe
federal statutes, regulations, executive orders, and other official acts, as
well as the Constitution itself, to confer the least authority consistent with
their language.  
  
This article is based on a longer paper on the origins of the non-delegation
doctrine I wrote for law school. That paper highlights a little-known debate
on the non-delegation doctrine applied to the question of whether Congress
could delegate the power to define postal roads. James Madison, among others,
argued that this was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to
the executive.
