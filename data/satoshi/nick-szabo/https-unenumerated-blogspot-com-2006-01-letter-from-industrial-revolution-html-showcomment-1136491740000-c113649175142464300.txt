BTW, it sounds like you and I agree with Abiah Darby's interlocutor: "...the
Destroyers of mankind are recorded and remembered, while the Benefactors are
unnoticed and forgotten."  
  
I tried to track down who her interlocutor was in this letter via Google, with
no luck. However the quote seems to have been a common sentiment at the time,
as a similarly phrased sentence occurred one year later (1776) in Gibbon's
_Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ : "Trajan was ambitious of fame; and as
long as mankind shall continue to bestow more liberal applause on their
destroyers than on their benefactors, the thirst of military glory will ever
be the vice of the most exalted characters." Sadly, our history books, which
focus more on destroyers like Napoleon than on creators like the A. Darbys,
continue this trend.
