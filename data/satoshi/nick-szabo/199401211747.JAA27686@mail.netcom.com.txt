Arthur Chandler:

So, this is only supposed to work one way?   If someone uses remailers
to dig into my personal life, accuse me of criminality, and threaten
me with violence, I'm supposed to just meekly take it?!!!!!!!!

I have the feeling Arthur Chandler's another one of the "Detweiler's
in my kill file" folks who needs a clue about what has been going on.
I'll send him my Detweiler archive forthwith so he can do his homework.
