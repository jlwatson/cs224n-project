Daniel, I don't much disagree with your observations. I'd add that the Drake
Equation combines many layers of such speculations and ignorance into one
whopping specemin of Bayesiology. These wild guesses usually end up based on
wish rather than observation. I'd also note that distinguishing artificial
from natural is usually far easier than further examination of discovered
culture which you rightly observe to be generally a very difficult task.
