The two Anonymi are within the region I've been thinking about. The difference
that stuck out for me is the far greater number of horses hauling carriages
and wagons in London whereas in China it was primarily other people who were
being used in those roles. (Except in the more remote eastern areas where
horses and camels were more available). Two little known but crucial facts are
that Great Britain by the 19th century had a much larger number of draft
animals per capita than the rest of the world (except for some of its former
colonies like the U.S.), and made much greater use of the horse as opposed to
the ox. As I will describe in future posts, this has deep connections to
Malthusian economics, capital investment, the industrial revolution, and
escaping from the Malthusian trap.  
  
One of those connections is suggested by the second Anonymous. And as Makarana
observes horses could actually get a surprising amount work of done
considering how much "horsepower" we put in our machines these days. So it's
misleading to think of the industrial revolution primarily in terms of steam-
powered factories and railroads, and more illuminating to think of the
economic driver of England and Scotland leading up to the industrial
revolution, and indeed well into the 19th century, as the horse. And to think
about how Great Britain came to have so many horses.  
  
I didn't see any obvious difference in how pedestrians and carriages
interacted, I'll have to take another look for that.  
  
P.S. it helps us all keep track of who's who if you choose pseudonyms, not
"Anonymous", thanks.
