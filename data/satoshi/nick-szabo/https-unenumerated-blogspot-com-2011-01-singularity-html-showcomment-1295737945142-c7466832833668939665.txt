nazgulnarsil, (a) the astronomical number of combinations in the genetic code
for the brain, and on top of that of techniques learned culturally, (b) the
analog nature of the brain, (c) the computational efficiency of
specialization, which implies the brain is composed of many specialized
techniques rather than one or a few generalized ones, and (d) the lack of
necessity for evolution to create understandable abstraction layers, as is
required when human engineers design things. All confirmed by how little
psychologists and neurologists still understand about brains, despite
centuries of study.
