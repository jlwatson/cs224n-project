Daniel, by "we" I mean what other people mean by the phrase, that is the group
of people who agree with me. :-)  
  
Incidentally, there have been two major sources of political power (whether
characterized as a property right or otherwise in history):  
  
(1) right of conquest, e.g. to pillage and plunder. Euphemism: none; in the
Middle Ages lawyers were honest and called it "right of conquest."  
  
(2) right of mob rule, e.g. to loot and lynch. Euphemism: "the will of the
people." This is what many people mean these days when they say "we" and I
share Daniel's concern about it.  
  
Legal systems and (outside of violent anarchies) political systems, and indeed
all real property, have always been based on these origins.
