 _Do you believe that if, at some point in future, we combine our experts
systems, tools, into a coherent framework of agency, this will be of no
advantage to the resulting agent that is large enough for it to pose a risk to
humanity?_  
  
Stated this way, I don't even buy the "if" part -- combining software systems
is a difficult engineering problem that gets much harder as the total lines of
code increase. I've seen large software systems and "coherent" is not how I'd
describe them. :-) Software is going to become more fragmented, not more
combined.  
  
And of course as you state I do indeed believe that to the extent such
combined software is feasible it would not pose any kinds of problems that
specialized software had not posed long before and to a far greater degree.
