Mencius,  
  
I expect most of the PR that currently goes into the press to voters will
instead be lots of evidence presented to the jury by the defense (the
franchise).  
  
BTW, I had some doubts about this before, but I now realize this is a real
trial, or at least a strong legal fiction thereof. Any taxpayer has standing
to sue to reduce or eliminate his taxes, and any other taxpayer can join -- it
will generally become a class action lawsuit. Then the jury decides on the
proper level of taxes for this agency.
