Good comments. Some brief answers:  
  
The rights to jury trial and certain other such rights in the original
Constitution and Bill of Rights that one might label "positive" rights are all
_procedural_ rights. They are rights necessary for the government to enforce
negative rights against itself and between persons within its jurisdiction.  
  
"rights...retained by the people" aren't any rights you can possibly imagine.
They are natural and common law rights, which at that time were negative
rights and procedural rights to enforce negative rights. Even modern courts
have envisioned unenumerated rights (now categorized under substantive Due
Process) as largely "rights to be left alone," and have rejected Roosevelt's
call for positive rights.  
  
Whether or not the founders had a special label for "negative rights" we can
observe the constitutional and common laws of that time and observe that they
were practically all negative rights and procedural laws to protect negative
rights. Since by "rights" in the common law and Constitution they meant
negative rights, they didn't need a special phrase like we do after
Roosevelt's so-called "Bill of Rights," which are not natural or common law
rights at all.  
  
Pensions for war widows were statutory, not common law or natural rights, and
can be interpreted as a matter of implied contract (contract, or more
generally personal consent, being the only way in the traditional common law
to create positive rights).
