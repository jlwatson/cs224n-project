Errata (sorry for the sloppy off-the-cuff writing):  
  
Last sentence in 2nd-to-last paragraph in my comment above should read
"...partial (but not preferred) use of arsenate in arsenic-heavy
environments..."  
  
In first paragraph, "So they haven't proven that phosphorous in at least some
necessary molecules is irreplaceable" should read "So they haven't proven that
phosphorous in in all necessary molecules [that contain it] is replaceable".  
  
I should add paranthetically, for readers who have forgotten their periodic
table, that arsenic is just below phosphorous on the table and thus functions
in much the same, but not identical way. For example it forms arsenates that
behave similarly but not identically to phosphates. They can generally be
taken up into biomolecules normally based on phosphates but the resulting
functions of those molecules are normally different enough to degrade the
organism to death -- the bacteria tested in this study being an exciting
exception, probably due to currently unknown chemistry in the cell modifying
the pertinent biochemical reactions.
