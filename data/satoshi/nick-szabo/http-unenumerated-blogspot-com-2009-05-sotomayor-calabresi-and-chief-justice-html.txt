Our 2006 moot court competiton at The George Washington University featured
Chief Justice John Roberts, law & economics guru Judge Guido Calabresi, and
Judge Sonia Sotomayor (now a nominee to serve with Roberts on our highest
court), and was replayed today on C-SPAN. I saw this in person when I was at
GWU -- it was fun to watch my fellow law students arguing with these seasoned
judges about whether subliminal ads can be banned under the First Amendment.
H/T to GWU Professor Orin Kerr.
