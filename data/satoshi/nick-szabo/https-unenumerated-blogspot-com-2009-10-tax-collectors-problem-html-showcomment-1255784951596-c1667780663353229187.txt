Nazgulnarsil, since the optimal point for economic growth or wealth is at a
tax rate well below the Laffer optimimum , one could derive as a corollary
that societies with better natural defenses, and thus lower defense costs (in
the days before the welfare state) would have higher economic growth (or
higher population growth in the Malthusian era before the industrial
revolution) per acre of arable land, and perhaps other desirable
characteristics as well, such as a more libertarian legal system, and that
such societies will be more more likely to conquer than be conquered. There
seems to be some geographical evidence for this: countries with natural
barriers of sea or mountain tended to create empires rather than be ruled
under them, and tended to have better legal systems and more economic
prosperity.
