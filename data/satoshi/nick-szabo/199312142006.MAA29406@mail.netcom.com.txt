Peter Wayner:

Is a one-way hash function or digital signature possible with the
following property: signature verification doesn't just determine
the boolean altered vs. pristine, but also shows the picture
distance between the altered and original?  Forgery may often
require an editing distance much greater than the error rate
from media noise or lossy compression.
