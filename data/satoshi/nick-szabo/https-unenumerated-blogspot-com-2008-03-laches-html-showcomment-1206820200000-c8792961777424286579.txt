The cases you cite probably combine corporate immortality with the doctrine of
_respondeat superior_ , the idea that a company is responsible for the acts of
its employees while on the job. This is a pretty entrenched doctrine, with
some good reasons for it. For these cases at least the time limit is a much
better solution.
