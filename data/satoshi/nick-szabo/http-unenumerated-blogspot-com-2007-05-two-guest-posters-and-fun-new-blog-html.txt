Unenumerated welcomes two guest bloggers for this summer. Mark Miller is a
computer scientist who has been involved in the Xanadu hypertext project (a
precursor of the Web), agoric computing projects, the E programming language,
and much else. Jon Roland is an expert on the U.S. Constitution and related
legal topics.  
  
If you love Unenumerated, have some good ideas, and would like to guest blog
this summer, please let me know.  
  
The fun new blog involves Mencius Moldbug and the political idea he calls
"formalism", which bears some resemblance to the idea of property in
everything.
