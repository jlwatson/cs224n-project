It's becoming common to patent distributed systems. For example, you might
have a patent on server software S and client software C, where a person
deploying server software S' and client software C' would infringe the patent.
But if S' is in Canada, and the C's are (at least in part) in the United
States, does that also infringe the patent S+C? And if so, where? That's the
big issue in NTP v. RIM, the "Blackberry case."  
  
The latest news is that the district (trial-level) court will go ahead and
move the case forward on remand while the case is appealed to the United
States Supreme Court and the USPTO reexamines NTP's e-mail patents at the
urging of RIM. One of the issues the district court will look at is whether
NTP reached a settlement with RIM for $450 million. NTP wants more!
