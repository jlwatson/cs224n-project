I couldn't agree more. Market economics makes no sense without property
rights, and the poorer the security of property rights the less the outcome
will resemble anything like a market. Property rights can also be important in
non-market situations (e.g. firms, franchises, and monarchies).  
  
However there are a number of economists who quietly study these things, and
they are very much worth reading. In particular I recommend Oliver Williamson,
Steve Cheung, Yoram Barzel, Janet Landa, and other "New Institutional
Economists" who study the role of contracts and property in creating not only
markets but also firms and other economic institutions.

BTW, I think Clark is onto something when he singles out temperament, rather
than IQ, as the main epigenetic differentiator of economic performance. But
much research in genetics, and probably new kinds of pscychological tests for
various important kinds of temperament, are required to turn his theory into
anything more than vague speculation.
