"Clearly erroneous" is the standard test for overturning a trial court's
findings of fact. The result is that appeals courts would have to treat chosen
arbitrators in the same way they treat trial courts, at least in the very
important and broad area of fact finding. There are a bunch of less important
areas I have left unspecified in the interests of brevity which have to be
looked at to see if they leave open loopholes for appeals courts to more
freely overturn arbitrators. Using more broad language, something like
"appeals courts shall review findings of facts and law of said arbitrators
using the same standards as for trial courts" might be better language, but
we'd then have to look hard to see if there are any legitimate reasons the two
should be treated differently in particular areas, because this leaves quite a
bit less flexibility for the appeals courts to do so.  
  
Mike's ideas are interesting, I'll have to think about them.
