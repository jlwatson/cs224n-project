 _PS. I suppose, nothing prevents a sufficiently corrupt railroad from selling
the arrester, pocketing the money and asking farmers for another one..._  
  
Actually, now that I read this again, it brings up another way, besides
coercion, in which anarcho-capitalist "contracts" are really treaties. When
negotiating "contracts" without any overarching legal authority that can
effectively enforce the contracts, enforcement proceeds along the lines of
treaty enforcement: might makes right, and treaties are broken quite often
except against powers with sufficient military superiority, collective embargo
clout (from coercing its citizens to respect the embargo), or similar to
enforce them.  
  
In the case of Coase himself and his non-anarchist followers, they assumed
there was already a legal authority that effectively enforced contracts
between the farmer and the railroad, so cheating like this by definition would
not happen (and in reality would be no worse than for normal commercial
contracts).
