jon: _the media is another example of an agent whose interests may not align
with the principal's -- in this case, the public._  
  
This is a great point which I shall endeavor to elaborate on.  
  
Technically, and of some practical importance as well, the legal (i.e.
contractual) principals of the mass media are not the public at all, but
advertisers.  
  
In a very broad sense the mass media have three major principals. The
viewers/listeners/readers and the advertisers are the two most obvious. But
the most influential are journalists' sources. The sources, not the
journalists themselves, do the vast majority of the investigation and even, in
the sense of dreaming up phraseology and spinning ideas, the writing of most
stories. Journalists thus usually end up acting as the agents of the people
with the most exciting stories.  
  
For these reasons, I agree with your conclusion that the representation
distance between friends acting as agents for each other is often far shorter
than that between the journalist and media consumer.
