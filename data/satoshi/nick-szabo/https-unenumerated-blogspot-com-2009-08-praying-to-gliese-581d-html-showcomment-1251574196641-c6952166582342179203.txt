"it takes just one civilization in a chain of them to choose death as the
universal good."  
  
The causal chain is parallel as well as sequential. Under what circumstances
and during what eras can one civilization destroy their peers? I believe this
is very rare. (And keep in mind I'm talking about existential threats to the
whole set of parallel civilizations here, not mere disasters, so that for
example nuclear war, 10.0 earthquakes on only one part of the planet, and so
on don't qualify).
