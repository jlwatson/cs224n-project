george weinberg: _One philosophical objection to the idea of gold-based money
is that the effort of mining and refining gold seems wasted._  
  
Demand is based on savings in transaction costs from bit gold, from it being a
better hedge or media of exchange than alternatives such as gold. (Because it
is more secure against political problems, can be used online without going
through trusted third parties like e-gold, has a completely measurable
stockpile, etc.) The resulting savings in transaction costs, amortized over
the ulimited lifetime of the bit gold, generally has to exceed these costs to
create this demand. As with gold mining, there is a wide range of costs, and
the scarcity matches the cost, so it's not a question of if there is a market
for bit gold, only a question of how big that market might eventually become
(the answer to which is highly uncertain, and mainly depends on the
possibilities of political disasters to which bit gold is the best hedge).  
  
 _I think the initial finding of gold deposits is largely serendipitous. This
would not be the case for bit gold._  
  
This depends on the mathematical puzzle, but most of the ones proposed (such
as hash algorithms) are probabilistic in nature, so depend on luck as well
well as skill.  
  
Economically, the much more important factor is that some "miners" will have
more spare cycles, better compilers, better algorithms, or in a big market
even better custom-designed circuits than others. So there is the usual
opportunity for a few of the best "miners" to make a profit, while the vast
majority of people will find some other way to make a living, just as with
gold or silver mining.
