Vladamir, given the totality of the video (especially the seeming nonchalance
of the pharmacist in going for the second gun with his back turned to the
injured robber), I think your characterization of it as an "extrajudicial
execution" is probably correct. It is possible, however, that the defense may
be correct that the defendant had regained consciousness and was getting up,
out of the view of the camera, in which case it's a closer call. In any case,
the jury will have much more information than we do. The position of the body,
the testimony of the women in the store, etc. will bear on this.  
  
As for the main motivation for the extrajudicial execution, it's probably the
same as for judicial executions, namely deterrence against future robbers,
albeit with the warped judgment of adrenalin and perhaps other factors at
play. Perhaps the likelihood of the injured robber's gang taking revenge (I'm
quite speculating here) is higher if he is just injured than if he is dead.
None of these, of course, are legal justifications for killing. Warped
judgment under adrenalin is one of the reasons we have rules of legal
procedure which those keeping guns should learn, and why the legal system
tries to leave deterrence of crime (as opposed to defense against imminent
threats) to trained officials rather than individuals. (I would be remiss if I
didn't add that RKBA does perform an important deterrence function -- it's
just that it leads to all sorts of problems if we try to make deterrence
separate from self-defense legal).
