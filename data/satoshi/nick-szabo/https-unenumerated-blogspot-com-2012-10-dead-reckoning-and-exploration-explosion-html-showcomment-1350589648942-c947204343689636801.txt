Each half covers four hours. The top half covers eight half-hour intervals and
the bottom half covers four one-hour intervals. So far two hours have elapsed.  
  
The bottom half shows the speed was six knots the first hour and eight and
one-half knots the second hour. (The bottom right peg shows the fraction).
