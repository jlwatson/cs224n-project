Followup: My secret tax economist friend informs me that "Tiebout competition"
is the technical term most commonly used for competition between local
jurisdictions. Googling that turned up some interesting things, including:  
  
* A good Tiebout page with links to quite a few works on the subject.  
  
* Bryan Caplan argues that property taxes raise exit costs by lowering property values, and thus stifle competition between local jurisdictions.
