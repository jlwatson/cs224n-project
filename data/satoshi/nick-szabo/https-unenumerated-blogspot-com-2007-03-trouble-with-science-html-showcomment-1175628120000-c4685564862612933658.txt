David Cooke -- thanks for the clarification. I was using "theoretical physics"
in the sense Smolin was using it; a better phrase may be "fundamental
theoretical physics" to distinguish it from other kinds like the condensed
matter physics you discuss.  
  
mtaven, the different government programs provide a very limited variety. They
all come with a very consistent bias -- they all have an incentive to increase
their revenue by exagerating problems, an incentive that is unmitigated by
market forces. And why do you say that "private concentrations of wealth that
are that large make me more nervous than the government"? Historically,
governments have imprisoned, killed, and otherwise destroyed the lives of far
more people than the greediest of corporations. Where governments have
controlled science they have abused it in a wide variety of ways, ranging from
turning science into state-sponsored dogma (e.g. Lysenkoism)to the racial
theories of National Socialist Germany and the subsequent concentration camps,
genocide, and grotesque experiments on unwilling victims. I am not aware of
any similar abuses by a corporation. Under modern laws private entities can
get away with far fewer abuses than can governments, and competition mediated
by a vast market is a strong force for balancing and cancelling out biases
which is largely absent from the D.C. insider culture and hierachical
scientific elite that largely determines scientific funding
