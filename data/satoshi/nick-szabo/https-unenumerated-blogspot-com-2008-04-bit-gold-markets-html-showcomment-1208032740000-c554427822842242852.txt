george: _With physical gold, mining more gold may bring benefit to the miner
but it decreases the purchasing power of gold already mined. I don't see why
increasing the quantity of refined gold in the world should change transaction
costs one way or the other._  
  
This is true, a but it illustrates another way in which timestamped bit gold
is superior to non-timestamped gold. Cheaper mining of gold per atom decreases
the purchasing power of gold atoms already mined by that amount, but because
of secure timestamping and inter-week arbitrage (i.e. not treating all bits as
fungible), a new week's worth of solved puzzles, regardless of how many or
large the puzzles are that are solved, changes the value of preceeding weeks
by a negligible amount in the long run. (BTW, for both gold and bit gold, spot
prices already reflect expectations of how much will be produced in the
future: but for gold this the number of atoms that will be produced, and for
bit gold this an amortization of future weeks versus weeks of past stockpile
already accumulated).  
  
The same effect can already be observed in collectible coins: coins from eras
in which coins were less seldom produced than today trade at increasing
premiums over their value as gold. Even if we discovered a way to transmute
lead into gold for free, these old coins would never lose their proof of
scarcity -- they would only lose their gold value, but never their value as
rare collectibles (which in the rarer epochs is far greater than the value of
their gold atoms). That's as close as we can come to time-stamping gold.
