Eric, that's another way to look at it, as a tautology -- trying to address a
very non-ideal situation (externalities with their intimately related
possibilities of coercion) by assuming everything is already ideal.  
  
If, however, we ignore the tautology, we actually find the Coase Theorem has
contradictory premises, and thus is false, as I have described.  
  
Either way, trying to use such a theorem to prove something about the social
world is incredibly silly.
