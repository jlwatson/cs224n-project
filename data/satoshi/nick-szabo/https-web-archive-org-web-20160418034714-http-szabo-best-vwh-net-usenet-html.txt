Those who have never tried electronic communication may not be aware of what a
"social skill" really is. One social skill that must be learned, is that other
people have points of view that are not only different, but *threatening*, to
your own. In turn, your opinions may be threatening to others. There is
nothing wrong with this. Your beliefs need not be hidden behind a facade, as
happens with face-to-face conversation. Not everybody in the world is a bosom
buddy, but you can still have a meaningful conversation with them. The person
who cannot do this lacks in social skills.
