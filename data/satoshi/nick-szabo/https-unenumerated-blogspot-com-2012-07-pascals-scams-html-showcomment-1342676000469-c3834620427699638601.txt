Tim, great comments on the actual history of computing -- far better
information there than in a library full of speculations about the future. So
it turns out that the future of computing depended much more on t-shirt
printing tech than on self-replicating diamondoid nanobots. Put that into your
Bayesian pipes and puff out some numbers. :-)  
  
Alexander, for most of your questions, even putting an answer into words, much
less numbers, would be an exercise in false precision. I don't know what the
"t-shirt printing" technology of the future will be (of course the futurists
who pretend to know such things don't know either, so I'm in good company).
Generally speaking, though, most of those things are already partially
happening now, but won't happen anywhere close to completely before culture
has radically changed in a myriad of ways, by which time such questions will
have become largely moot, shocking as they may seem to us today.
