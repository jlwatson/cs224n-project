 _It seems to me that if courts follow established precedent it would be
impossible to know if better results would be obtained had the original court
decided differently..._  
  
One answer is parallel jurisdictions with different lines of precedent. In the
U.S., for example, there are 50 states each with its own version of common
law. One can then compare results from state to state.  
  
Generally speaking, common law is a much slower in its development than
technology. But this reflects the far greater complexity of the subject, i.e.
of human relations. It's quite a superstition to think that there is a
shortcut way to good law, but alas this superstition is extremely common.
