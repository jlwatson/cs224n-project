Another thing to think about wrt the inter-period markets: besides the
speculators who will do much of the estimating of how much production cost in
each period, the main players in these markets will be the miners and the
issuers (mints). Miners will exchange newly mined bits (grains) for earlier
ones. The earlier grains, which have a more mature market values, can than be
held or spent by the miners or exchanged for other currencies. Mints (issuers)
will buy more grains (solution bits) for reserves as they issue more coins
(bank notes). The miners thus create the supply of grains and the mints create
much of the demand. There will also be demand for bit gold (grains) simply as
stores of value in themselves, just there is demand for precious metals and
collectibles as such, but even if we ignore such investors, we have parties
creating supply and demand and thus a market for each period.
