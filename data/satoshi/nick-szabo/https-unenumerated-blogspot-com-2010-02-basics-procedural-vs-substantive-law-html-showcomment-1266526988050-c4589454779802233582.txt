Lawyers love a good oxymoron. :-) "Substantive due process" can be taken as
referring to substantive areas of law that should be outside of anybody's
jurisdiction, i.e. that nobody has jurisdiction over. The issue of determining
whether a court has jurisdiction over a certain substantive area of law is
called subject matter jurisdiction -- a future "basics" post. It violates a
procedural law (subject matter jurisdiction) to enforce the law in certain
substantive areas. So the phrase actually makes sense. I recount some of the
history here.
