LEDs are more energy efficient and last far longer than light bulbs. But their
color range has been rather limited. A graduate student at Vanderbilt
University has discovered that you can paint LEDs with quantum dots . The
color produced by the quantum dots, nanocrystals of a precise specific size,
can be varied by varying the size of the crystal, but the result is usually
one specific wavelength. Michael Bowers at Vanderbilt discovered that crystals
of cadmium and selenium that contain either 33 or 34 pairs of atoms are both
preferentially formed (thus making mass production easy) and emit a broad-
spectrum white light akin to the sun or a standard light bulb.  
  
Another interesting application of quantum dots is for more efficient
thermoelectric devices, for example devices to cool our increasingly hot
silicon computer chips. Quantum dots allow a greater ratio of thermal to
electrical conductivity -- that means more heat pumped while retaining control
over the electric current.  
  
Also interesting is infrared paint. It seems to me that infrared-scale quantum
dot paint might also be used for passive thermal control.
