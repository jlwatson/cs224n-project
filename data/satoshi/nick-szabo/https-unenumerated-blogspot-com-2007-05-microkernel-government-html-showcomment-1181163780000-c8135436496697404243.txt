MM, I don't recommend playing the authority game. Since I'm the author of the
leading paper on the monarcho-franchise legal structure of medieval and
Renaissance England, you at least grossly exagerate when you suggest that I've
studied only democratic or republican authorities. The parties and judges
quoted in the Selden case reports were quite thoroughly monarchical. It is you
who seem to have almost no familiarty with non-totalitarian monarchical forms
(such as monarcho-franchise and king-in-Parliament).  
  
I'm also quite familiar with the totalitarian monarchical tradition of the
Justinian Code, Bodin, and Hobbes, of which your philosophy seems to be but a
faint reflection. I am furthermore familiar with Olson's theory of the
stationary bandit (a great explanation of monarchy and the "economics" of the
use of force which I highly recommend). I'm also familiar with Hoppe's time-
preference theory of monarchy which you seem to be citing -- and which by
itself predicts that North Korea should be more stable and libertarian than
any democracy. (Unless, of course, we engage in your circular reasoning:
theory predicts that oppression comes from insecurity; Kim Jung Il oppresses
his people, therefore he must be insecure, therefore his dynasty is not a
counter-example to the theory).
