This is from a very old Usenet post of mine:  
  
I can only mention [in reply to a previous post] my Law of the Dominant
Paradigm:  

> Given opposing opinions with equal evidence in their favor, the less popular
opinion is more likely to be correct.

To see why this is so, consider how evidence -- facts, data, observations,
etc. are obtained and transmitted by human culture. Each observer and
transmitter passes on a filtered version of the evidence, either consiously or
unconsiously, to fit a particular paradigm. If most of the information
gatherers in a society -- journalists, academicians, writers, movie studios,
etc. -- subscribe to one out of several possible opinions, it is natural to
expect that more evidence will be gathered that supports that opinion than the
others, even if the some of the other opinions have equal validity. This does
not mean that evidence is useless; it means that evidence is a function both
of the reality and the paradigms held by the information gatherers. Evidence
given in an argument must be adjusted by the resources devoted to gathering
evidence in favor of each opinion. The amount of bias caused by the dominant
paradigm effect is not well-defined, but an extremely new or unpopular opinion
is likely to have little evidence in its favor, since little has been done to
gather such evidence.  
  
On the net, it is very easy to fall into the mindset of simply agreeing with
and copying those already dominant on the net. Far more fruitful are original
ideas, disagreements, and working to find evidence for unpopular and new
opinions to determine their worth.
