"Always will be" is quite a long time, and I wouldn't go quite that far....
Maybe all posthuman robots will come with a switch that automatically puts
them into "sleeping" mode when they commit a tort or public nuisance, and they
can't wake up until their bank accounts have been deducted for the damages --
or some similar protocol but more sophisticated to account for bankruptcy and
endangerment and such. If such things are defined as not constituting force
then perhaps there will come a day. :-)
