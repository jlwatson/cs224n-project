ComputerWorld has a good article on what data they did and did not find on
hotel card keys from various U.S. chains. They generically claim that some
European and older U.S. card key systems put personal information on hotel
card keys, which could leave guests vulnerable to ID theft or other privacy
violations. The article's author, Robert L. Mitchell, concludes that current
card keys used at major U.S. hotel and motel chains are OK, although in some
cases they found data which they were unable to decode. Via Emergent Chaos.
