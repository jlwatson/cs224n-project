Barry, that's a great article, thanks. I'm a big fan of Rose Wilder Lane.  
  
Anonymous, I agree that we shouldn't count out anybody's chances to win at
this point. Huckabee and Paul are both great examples of candidates doing well
(the former in polls and the latter financially and organizationally) that few
expected to be factors a few months ago. But I wanted to emphasize that the
"chance to win" is not the only reason candidates win support and is not the
only political impact a primary candidate can have.  
  
Even if Paul doesn't run himself, that wouldn't stop him from endorsing the
Libertarian candidate or at least failing to endorse the non-libertarian
Republican candidate if he can't win concessions. Or he might make only a
lukewarm endorsement of the Republican nominee instead of putting his money
and organization to work for him. That's a game all the candidates play. Of
course, it will help greatly if Paul gets plenty of delegates for the leading
candidates to bargain for, but his general ability to raise money and organize
is also a great bargaining chip. The November 2008 election as with the last
two will likely be close, and Ron Paul's avid supporters, who have
demonstrated an astounding organizational and financial clout, are a prize
swing group that Republicans, Libertarians, and perhaps even Democrats will be
fighting over if Paul continues his great money raising and makes a good
showing in several states. And, I agree that besides all these he does,
astoundingly, also have a shot at winning outright -- which would truly be a
shot heard 'round the world.
