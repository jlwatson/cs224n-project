John Roland presents strong evidence that the 14th Amendment of the United
States Constitution, ratified shortly after the end of the Civil War, was
intentended to incorporate (as well as other parts of the Bill of Rights), as
a restriction on States, the 2nd Amendment. It was incorporated in the form of
an individual and equal right to keep and bear arms, even if, for the sake of
argument, the original 2nd Amendment was not an individual right. There is
also some evidence that the "liberty" part of the Due Process Clause was
intended to protect, among other things, liberty of the house: that it
included "... the right [of a person] to be safe and protected in that citadel
of his love [i.e. his home] [and] ... to bear arms for the defense of himself
and family and his homestead."
