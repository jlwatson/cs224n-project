Game-based virtual property is something I'll have more to say about in the
future. It might give us some insight on how other kinds of purely or
primarily online property may develop. Of course, game-based virtual property
is no more "imaginary" than any other kind of property. Its value, like that
of any other property, is based directly on the various preferences people
have for it, as well as well as on its supply, and only indirectly on
attributes of the property on which those preferences are based. Those
attributes may be tangible or intangible.  
  
One interesting issue for game-based property is whether inter-game trade in
it ruins the sport of the game. Imagine, for example, if in baseball the New
York Yankees could buy not only bid for the best players, but could directly
buy bases. Or even just barter bases between games. Imagine the Texas Rangers
allowing the Yankees to turn a double into a home run, in exchange for two
extra runs for the Rangers in a Yankees-Rangers game next year, so that the
Yankees could beat the Boston Red Sox this year for the eastern division
title.  
  
A "level playing field" that is considered necessary for sports to be
"sporting" seems to require various restrictions on trade. The goal of a sport
or game is typically not efficiency in scoring runs or accumulating "gold
pieces," but entertainment.  
  
Many people justify trade restrictions outside the realm of sports and games,
where efficiency is quite important, on the same kind of ethics. The results
are often wasteful, and sometimes disastrous.
