 _One should reasonably expect lower degree of adaptation to the new state_  
  
This is a rather generic and abstract argument. If you want to make it in this
area you should make it for other kinds of changes to complex systems as well.
In particular you should make it for many of the social changes we're going or
have gone through, many of which have a greater impact on human life than
redistribution of the weather patterns, and where technology is less useful
for adaptation. (What technologies mitigate high divorce rates, high rates of
children raised without fathers, and so on? Much easier to adapt to changing
rain patterns by e.g. irrigation or changing what crops grow where).  
  
Since I tend to agree with arguments about the costs of adapting to change,
I've come out in support of developing institutions like cap & trade that we
could use in the future to slow and eventually reduce CO2 emissions. Being new
institutions, they need a long process of trial and error before they will be
ready to start gently nudging our economies towards less CO2 output.  
  
However, looking on it as an economic problem, the bulk of the solution will
probably have to be adaptation, not draconian economic changes. Just looking
at the impact on agriculture, for example, a draconian cut in fossil fuel use
would be far more devastating to world food supplies than the need to adapt to
some redistributed weather patterns via crop changes, irrigation, etc. Keep in
mind that besides exporting CO2, great fuel consuming countries like the U.S.
and Canada also export food.
