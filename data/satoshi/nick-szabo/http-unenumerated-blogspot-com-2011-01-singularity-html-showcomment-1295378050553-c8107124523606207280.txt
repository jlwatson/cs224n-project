P.S. to my last comment: Emile, obviously your post was in category (2),
Blogger pathologically categorized it as "Spam".  
  
gwern:  
 _the only quasi-Singulitarian I am aware of who has claimed there will be an
actual completed infinity is Frank Tipler,_  
  
Then Vinge's analogy to the infinite density of a black hole (origin of the
term "The Singularity") is a rather bad one isn't it? Why use a bad analogy to
label the movement?  
  
Emile:  
 _It does seem to me, though, that the "time before the future becomes totally
baffling" has been getting shorter and shorter _  
  
Although there have been plenty of "spikes" where the future has become in
many ways baffling to prior generations, per the examples I gave above. It is
probable in terms of the raw complexity of society,if we could measure such a
thing, that we are still either on the first leg of the S-curve inflexion or
at least not so far past the inflexion that we notice things slowing down.  
  
Of course, as I stated different pieces follow (to the extent they can be said
to follow curves at all) very different S-like curves. Growth has slown down
greatly in certainly areas, e.g. the growth in performance of transportation
which was so dramatic in the 19th and most of the 20th century but since the
1970s has proceeded at an arduous crawl and in some ways (e.g. the efficiency
of public transportation) may have even declined. Even many IT indicators are
now growing far more slowly than Moore's Law, for example CPU speed. We face
many practical limits long before we face the ultimate physical limits, and
whether or how we may surpass such limits is unpredictable (there's often
great truth to the saying that we don't predict the future, we make it).
