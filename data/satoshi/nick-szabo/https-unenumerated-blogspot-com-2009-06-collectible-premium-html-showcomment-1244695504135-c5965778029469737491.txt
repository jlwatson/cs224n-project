Here is some additional explanation (from a comment I left on the professor's
blog):  
  
Demand curves for housing and commodities have a utility (consumption)
component. If a shopper for a house plans to live in it and rent out their
basement, the demand curve for purchasing the house also has a cash flow
component: the demand for the house includes both utility and flow components.
Finally, any asset that provides any hedge against inflation has what we are
calling a _collectible_ component. The collectible component reflects
inflation expectations. Thus, with non-zero inflation expectations the demand
curve for that house includes all three components: utility, flow, and
collectible.  
  
Commodities can hedge against long-term inflation and thus often have a high
collectible component on top of their consumption component. Houses also often
have a high collectible premium. Stocks also have a (smaller) collectible
premium.
