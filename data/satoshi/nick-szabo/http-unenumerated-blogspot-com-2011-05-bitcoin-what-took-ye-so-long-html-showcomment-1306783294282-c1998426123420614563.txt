Daniel, I suggest reading the bit gold description more carefully. There are
no balances in the underlying bit gold system. Just replicated chains of
titles to solution bits. Because these solution bits are not fungible between
one period and another, on top of this I propose bit gold markets, consisting
of  
  
(1) markets that set relative prices between the solution bits of one period
and another, and  
  
(2) dealers who use these market prices to bundle solution bits from different
periods into bundles of standard value, creating a fungible commodity, which
is then used as the currency.  
  
Taking commodities of different qualities and quantities and making bundles of
standard value is an art common to most commodity markets, and here the task
is easy because markets set the prices for the different periods. Admittedly,
I've specified the bit gold market layer in much less technical detail than
the underlying bit gold layer because there are many design choices that could
be made and I've been focusing on the economics rather than the computational
and security mechanisms of the higher layer. Still I think the basic scheme is
clear enough.
