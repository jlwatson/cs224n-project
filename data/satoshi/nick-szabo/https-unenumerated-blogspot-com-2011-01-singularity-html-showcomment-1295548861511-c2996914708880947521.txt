Emile, I've already answered your questions above to the extent possible: the
short answer being that specialized computational techniques that are far more
efficient will appear long before and be vastly more competitive than
"functional brain simulation", to the extent the latter is even feasible. Any
benefits or problems posed by these simulations (outside the hope of saving
our own consciousnesses, which is beyond the realm of this discussion) will be
posed much earlier and to orders of magnitude greater degree by specialized
techniques.
