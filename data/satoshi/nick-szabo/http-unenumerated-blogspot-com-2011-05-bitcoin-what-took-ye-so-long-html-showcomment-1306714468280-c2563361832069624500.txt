Daniel, that's a good explanation and I agree it makes Bitcoin inflation risks
worse too.  
  
I do have solution to the unit of account problem:  
  
"Bit gold will be entirely public: no one gains secure title to any puzzle
solutions until they are published. Thus, the exact amount and kind of puzzle
solutions during a given period are well known, and perfectly define the
supply curve relative to future weeks for all time thereafter...To create
fungible units dealers will bundle strings of different value into pools of a
standard value (i.e. collect strings into a pool so that the sum of the market
values of the strings in the pool add up to the standard value)...there are no
ongoing changes in subjective valuations [or differences in security
properties] between bit strings [of different periods] to worry about, but
instead the demand for bit gold is purely for its monetary functions, and thus
purely based on how scarce the supply of puzzles solved during a given time
period was and is...[thus] The supply and demand curves of different pools
will change in the same way over time, and the relative values of pools will
not diverge from their initial relative values. Using tranches as standard
denominations for a currency [thus] does not create arbitrage opportunities."
