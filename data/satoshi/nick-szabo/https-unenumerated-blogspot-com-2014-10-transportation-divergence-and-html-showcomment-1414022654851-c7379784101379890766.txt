moa: I suppose "multiplier" is a more traditional way to say "virtuous
recursion." :-) Cultivated oats and barley were indeed staples for horses as
well as peasants. Two different solutions to the Malthusian dilemma: China
used their humans as draft animals, whereas the English used horses and might
feed them in preference to feeding the humans. Even as late as the 1840s
complaints were heard that the English "fed their horses before they fed the
Irish".

Here's a great map showing the very widespread and local nature of the English
canal system, which greatly increased the area within short land transport
distance of the far cheaper water transport (both horse-powered):
