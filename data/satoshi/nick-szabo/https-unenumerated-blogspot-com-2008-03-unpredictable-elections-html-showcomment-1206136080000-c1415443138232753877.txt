BTW, I'm moving a bleg here from a defunct comment thread below:  
  
I am looking for a new platform besides Blogger to blog on. I need to be able
to export my old posts cleanly from Blogger to the new platform, I should also
be able to export cleanly from the new platform (I don't want my content held
hostage by a platform), and it should be an advance in reader friendliness.
Dear readers, a bleg, what platform(s) do you recommend?
