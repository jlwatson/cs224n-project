The implied inflation in 1980 does look very trusting given the then
contemporary inflation rate, but in retrospect gold investors weren't quite
trusting enough. If you look at the nominal gold price (which hit $800 an
ounce and later in the 1980s went down to $250) it looks like a bubble.
Everybody underestimated Paul Volcker.  
  
Also keep in mind that the dollar price of gold reflects inflation
expectations in all dollar-linked currencies, not just in the dollar itself
and certainly not just in the U.S, much less just among U.S. urban consumers.
In that sense, my (not to mention others') use of CPU-I to estimate inflation
is very misleading. The inflation expectations implied by the gold price is
(perhaps for the first time -- does anybody know of an earlier attempts to
derive this?) an intersubjective estimate of global dollar and dollar-linked
currency inflation, i.e. one that takes into account every market
participant's actual estimates of inflation based on their actual consumption
expectations as reflected in market prices, rather than being based on
formulas like CPI-U that attempt to mimick (without really knowing) the
consumption expectations of consumers.
