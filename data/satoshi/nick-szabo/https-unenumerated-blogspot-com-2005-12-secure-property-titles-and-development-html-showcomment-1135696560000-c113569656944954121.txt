The best markets for this probably are:  
  
(1) New kinds of property, especially online property. For example, we might
start with an intermediate level domain name server.  
  
(2) places where title records are insecure, such as many politically or
economically underdeveloped countries. At least two common dangers to guard
against:  
  
(a) destruction of paper titles in a natural disaster, such as occurred at
Aceh after last year's tsunami.  
  
(b) destruction of titles for political reasons, as occurred in many communist
revolutions, in Yugoslavia when it broke up, and many other despicable and
common examples.  
  
#1 is easier as one can start very small scale. For #2 an NGO might be a good
way to get it going.
