tehom: _Nick, that's like saying "There's only one person for whom it's  
rational to invest in the stock market"._  
  
The difference is that the stock market is positive-sum -- the average return
is positive, the average investor has made a profit over almost all 15-year
periods. Not so in an unsubsidized event betting market -- the average bettor
makes nothing minus transaction costs.  
  
 _Economists tell me that valuations in a stock market will  
approximate the risk-neutral valuation_  
  
Again, this has nothing to do with prediction or decision markets of the kind
we are discussing here.  
  
 _An extreme example like the $20 billion payoff_  
  
Actually, I picked the example straight out of this year's headlines, and it
is one of the *less* extreme bailouts we've seen recently. $20 billion is very
small potatoes in Washington D.C.  
  
_In order for it to be enacted, it would  
have to be pushed far from its "proper" valuation. _  
  
But nobody knows what the "proper" valuation is supposed to be. If the GM
bailout market predicts a 0.05%/yr greater growth of GDP over the next 10
years if the bailout is enacted, (a) nobody knows (as opposed to merely
believes) that this is not the proper price, (b) it is far within the noise of
expected GDP growth, making a bet against it very close to a 50/50 proposition
even if you have some special knowledge, and (c) if it beats the projections
from competing policies, under futarchy rules it should be enacted.  
  
Time is also a crucial factor here. What is the decision based on, the last
price, the last month, or the last year? Whichever you choose, the "bear" can
choose to goose the price over just that particular period.
