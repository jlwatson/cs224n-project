Speaking of betting, the well-defined claims of uncertain outcome that I call
for here would also make good candidates for prediction markets, with the
caveat of a couple limitations. First, people have more incentive to
participate in prediction markets when the event(s) being bet on (here the
experiment(s)) are imminent. Second, if the issue is sufficiently uncertain
market participants will lack good information and the resulting prediction
will merely reflect the general ignorance.  
  
However, in the intermediate cases where this is good information but it is
scattered, and for issues of sufficient economic importance or entertainment
value prediction markets might work quite well.  
  
I'd be interested in pointers to any such prediction markets that are
currently active.  
  
To the extent the uncertain parts of technologies can't be tested easily and
imminently, they remain highly uncertain and make very poor bases for policy
or other important decisions.
