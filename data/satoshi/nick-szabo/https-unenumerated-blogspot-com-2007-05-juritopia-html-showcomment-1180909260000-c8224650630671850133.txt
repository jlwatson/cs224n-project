Mencius,  
  
I don't know what you mean by "people will scheme." Can you be specific? Who
specifically will so scheme, and why?  
  
The separations of powers and checks and balances incentivize people to
respect the law -- as opposed to arbitrary power which incentivizes the power
holder to disrespect it. I'm certainly not relying primarily on traditional
respect for the law -- rather I am setting up a structure where maintaining
and even reviving traditional respect for the law is the best strategy for all
involved.  
  
You finally admit that your government would set taxes at the Laffer maximum.
Quite a libertarian outcome, to maximize government revenues! BTW, I'd bet
that the vast majority of economists would say today, if you asked them, that
most U.S. taxes are set well below the Laffer maximum revenue point. 20th
century democracy is rather tax-heavy compared to some earlier eras (e.g. the
19th century), but far worse, including what you now admit you are proposing,
is quite possible. The Laffer maximum has been reached only at the most
outrageous of tax rates, e.g. the 70-90% tax rates at the top brackets in the
U.S. during the middle of the last century. The Laffer maximum is about the
same as what slave cost his slave owner in ongoing costs, i.e. about 30-40% of
his output.
