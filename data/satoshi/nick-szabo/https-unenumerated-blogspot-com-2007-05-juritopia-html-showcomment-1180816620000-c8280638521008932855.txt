Mencius,  
  
Your argument against my franchises is also an argument against your own
proposal. There is nothing preventing my franchises from making profits,
issuing shares, and paying dividends, and I expect they often will. They might
also be sole proprietorships.  
  
The big differences are that I have two mechanisms that can put a cap on our
for-profit coercers -- juries and constitutionally enforced legal competition
(a contractual opt-out for subgroups among themselves in many areas of the
law). You have none.  
  
Your proposal is far more dangerous in terms of information systems, as the
same organization that profits from high taxes also can legally control the
press and education. My franchises are very restricted in their scope and can
do no such thing. Nonterritorial decentralization -- i.e. unbundled property
rights in legal subject matter -- is a very powerful idea, and that it solves
your information system problem, whereas no other proposal has ever solved it,
is a very good example of that power.
