Thanks Donald. Possibly burials could have sometimes been "sacred hoards"
usable by e.g. only family members in dire straits. Difficulty and sacred
taboo against digging up would protect this "insurance policy" against
momentary whims (by which family wealth in more accessible modes often gets
frittered away). Interesting idea!

Anonymous, coordinated violence long preceded the dawn of the state, it has
existed since before the dawn of our species. It did indeed play a role in the
origins of media for the satisfaction of obligations, as I will relate in a
future post.
