5678, perhaps @Kevembuangga was thinking more of medieval Christian
theologians than of today's fundamentalists. These scholars, very well
credentialed as the first recipients of the "Doctor of Philosophy" (PhD)
degrees, were very knowledgeable about logic, and used it to prove, based on a
variety of questionable assumptions, the existence of God. And of course, they
demanded that their opponents rigorously _disprove_ the existence of God,
which is about the same thing as asking for a mathematical disproof of The
Singularity. Very rigorous fellows, they were. Albeit not very scientific,
IMHO.
