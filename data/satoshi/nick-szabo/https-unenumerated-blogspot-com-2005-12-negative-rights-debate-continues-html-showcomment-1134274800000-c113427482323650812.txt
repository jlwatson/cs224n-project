Mike, I did point out Adam's error -- "[o]f coure, many so-called
'progressives' like Roosevelt...disagreed" with Adam and the U.S. founders. I
also pointed out in the earlier thread that many communist constitutions,
among others, were or are full of such declarations of positive rights. That
positive rights became popular along with Marx during the Depression no great
mystery; it's not worth belaboring the obvious.  
  
What is worth discussing is what effects these rights (and the mindset behind
promoting such rights, which ignores the corresponding involuntary servitudes)
actually had or failed to have on actual people. Despite of (and sometimes
because of) Roosevelt's promotion of positive rights, many other rights were
violated under his rule. This is hardly "loosely related"; it's one of the two
theses I said that I am arguing, namely the negative effects of positive
rights.
