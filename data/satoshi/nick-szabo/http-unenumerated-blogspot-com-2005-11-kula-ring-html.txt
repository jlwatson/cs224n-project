Just off the cost of New Guinea, Melanesians evolved (over thousands, and
perhaps even tens of thousands, of years) a unique commercial institution
known as the "kula ring" for the collectibles that circulated within it.  
  
The unforgeably scarce kula collectibles doubled as "high power" money and
mnemonic for stories and gossip. Many of the goods traded, mostly agricultural
products, were available in different seasons, and so could not be traded in
kind. Kula collectibles solved this double-coincidence problem as an
unforgeabaly costly, wearable (for security), and circulated (literally!)
money. Necklaces circulated clockwise, and armshells counter-clockwise, in a
very regular pattern. By solving the double-coincidence problem an armshell or
necklace would prove more valuable than its cost after only a few trades, but
could circulate for decades. Gossip and stories that about prior owners of the
collectibles further provided information about upstream credit and liquidity.
In other Neolithic cultures collectibles, usually shells, circulated in a less
regular pattern but had similar purposes and attributes.
