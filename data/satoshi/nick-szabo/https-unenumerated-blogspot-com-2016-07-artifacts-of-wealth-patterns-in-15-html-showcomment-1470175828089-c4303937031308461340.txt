"As for the Mesolithic, images of figures apparently pierced by spears are
shown from cave and rock art in Italy and France, painted over 20,000 years
ago. Mesolithic remains of humans apparently killed by spears and arrows are
cited from many sites, including in Roumania, France, Algeria, Denmark,
Sweden, Russia, Ukraine and India. An especially detailed description is
provided of what appears to have been a massacre by spears with stone points
of 59 people all ages and sexes at "site 117" near Djebel Sahaba in the Sudan
along the Nile River some 12,000 years ago." \-- http://www.culture-of-
