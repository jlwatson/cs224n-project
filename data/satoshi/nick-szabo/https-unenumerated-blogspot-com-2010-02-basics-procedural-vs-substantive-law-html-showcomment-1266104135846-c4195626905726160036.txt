Alrenous, I agree that's a good distinction. I don't know of a single word or
official phrase for it. Note that both can involve coercion (e.g. subpoena of
witnesses). Although coercion of third parties, unlike coercion of suspects,
leaves a bad taste in my mouth, it's a normal and necessary part of the
system.  
  
On your second question, by who and whom do you just mean plaintiff and
defendant? The area called "personal jurisdiction" is about who and whom can
be plaintiff or defendant in what court(s), although it's usually based on
where the plaintiff and defendant were or are and where the court(s) are. In
the Middle Ages it was more common to base it on status, e.g. merchant fair
courts had personal jurisdiction over people who had the status of "merchants"
and attended the fair, even if the act in dispute occurred outside the fair.
Status can still sometimes be a distinction e.g. with military court
jurisdiction over members of the military. But it's mostly based on whose
territory the act occurred in or that you are in when the suit is brought.
Personal jurisdiction is a big topic in the Civil Procedure course. I discuss
it here and here.
