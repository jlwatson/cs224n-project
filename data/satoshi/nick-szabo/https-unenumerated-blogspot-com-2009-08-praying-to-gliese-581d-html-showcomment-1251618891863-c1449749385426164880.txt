Wilson, thanks again for your answers. I find these criteria for
"inappropriate" messages to the heavens very interesting, and especially the
role of U.S. and Australian government agencies in establishing criteria for
these communications. It sounds like your criteria took into account only the
reaction of your fellow humans, and not the possible reactions of the putative
ETIs. Not that I think this is wrong -- I believe that it's impossible for any
of us to predict the reactions of a completely alien, not to mention probably
nonexistant, culture to any particular content. But there are plenty of people
in SETI who think they can guess this better than the rest of us, and possibly
NASA thinks so too, so I find the issue fascinating.  
  
"This was a requirement by the Australian government and NASA, neither of whom
wanted to be involved in the publication and transmission of profanity, slurs,
belligerence or otherwise inappropriate comments."  
  
They apparently either didn't realize or didn't mind that using government
resources to send prayers to aliens in the first place might be considered
offensive.  
  
I presume there are specific documents from the Australian government and NASA
that laid out these criteria? Since these criteria are an issue of public
policy, can you publish these documents, or at least quote the relevant
sections from them?  
  
I am also interested in the financing of this venture. Did COSMOS or other
private organizations pay full rates for the DSN time, or was this time
provided free or at subsidized rates by the U.S. and/or Australian
governments?
