DN: "On high-end phones, it's around 500 milliseconds, which is still not
quite "instantaneous", though already within the realm of acceptability. The
reason is that the mobile industry "use their Moore's Law bounty to buy
battery life", as Ian Grigg deftly puts it."  
  
That's an important point, but do these numbers take into account crypto in
advanced mathematical algebras like elliptic curve, NTRU, etc? There can be an
orders-of-magnitude speedup. Google tunrs up a number of blind signatures
implemented in elliptic curves, for example this one.  
  
Algebras like elliptic curve allow shorter keys and/or less CPU-intensive
crypto operations for the same strength than RSA and normal discrete-log based
crypto. ECC was being used for cell phones ten years ago. There have been a
variety of new algebras (fields, rings, etc.) used for crypto since Chaum
invented blinding, and I would imagine (though I must admit the math is beyond
me) that blinding can be made to work in most of them if not all. (I'm pretty
confident that blinding can be made to work in any analogs of RSA or DSA, e.g.
the elliptic curve analog of DSA as in the above-linked paper). Of course,
some of these may still be patent burdened. (Although basic ECC and Chaum's
blind signatures are both off-patent, and combinations of blind signatures
with other mathematical fields seem obvious to me, especially where they are
just analogs of RSA or DSA, but that is certainly not a legal opinion :-)
