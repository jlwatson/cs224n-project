Orbital Express has demonstrated a number of interesting techniques of great
long-term importance, such as the automated refueling of spacecraft. (Here is
the biggest long-term reason why automated and on-orbit assembly and refueling
are important). But the mission also demonstrated the feasibility of an idea
that is probably also of great but nearer-term importance, which I call mobile
redundancy. The idea is that if one has a constellation of standard
satellites, redundancy can be provided with mobile spare parts rather than by
building on-board redunancy into each satellite as is done now. This could
result in a large overall savings in weight launched per year of useful
satellite lifetime.
