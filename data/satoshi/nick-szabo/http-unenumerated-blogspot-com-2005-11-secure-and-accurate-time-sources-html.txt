Broadcasts using sound or radiation, from sources such as radio, bell towers,
and astronomical phenomena, must send out the same value to every receiver. A
remote beacon such as a pulsar has perfect security: the access structure is
any party, and its complement, the attack structure, is the empty set. For
human controlled broadcasts, the attack structure consists only of the
broadcaster and the access structure is any receiver.  
  
Natural broadcasts are thus immune to the problem (known in computer science
as the Byzantine Generals problem) of a transmitter sending different values
to different receivers. Indeed, distributed network researchers have gone to
great lengths to recreate this simple property on the Internet with logical
broadcast protocols. The results are incomplete and very inefficient compared
to physical broadcasts.  
  
Nature provides clocks that are oblivious to the malicious intentions of any
outside parties and many orders of magnitude more accurate than random delays
that face attackers on the Internet. If critical Internet servers were
synchronized to natural clocks in a secure and timely fashion, they would be
immune to attacks that relied on uncertainties in timing. Here are some
comparisons of the stability (error creep) in good natural clocks. Pulsars
overtake atomic clocks in accuracy after about 4 months.
