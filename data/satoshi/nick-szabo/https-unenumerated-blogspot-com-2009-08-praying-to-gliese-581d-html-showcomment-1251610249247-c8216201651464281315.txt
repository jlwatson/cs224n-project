Wilson, thank you for your comments. My responses:  
  
#1. "COSMOS" is in very large font, the dominant lettering on the page, and
"Enid News & Eagle" in very small font -- I failed to recognize the latter.
Thank you for the clarification. It remains a hilarious example of the
preposterous utopianism of many in the aliens-we-can-talk-to crowd.  
  
#2. That a publicity surge will likely increase your advertising and
subscription revenues is an obvious inference the reader can draw from the
statistics you quote, even if you intended to leave a different impression. As
to whether you, who are presumably responsible for increasing COSMOS'
advertising and subscription revenues through your editorial decisions, also
recognize this consequence I also leave to readers to judge even if you are
not willing to admit that you are actually doing the job of an editor of a
subscription-and-advertising based magazine. You've done your job well, why
not be straightforwardly proud of it?  
  
3\. This context is not very relevant here -- on the list the charge was made
that what you were doing was a publicity stunt and you agreed that it was a
"stunt".  
  
Anyway, it is uproariously funny to hear a journalist complaining about being
quoted out of context. Thanks for the belly laugh. :-)
