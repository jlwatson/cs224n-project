Well, keep in mind that I have legal schooling and I said "may", not "will".
:-) As it happens, I've already read a large amount of material on this
subject over many years, so I have much I could blog about but it's very
disorganized. How much I blog about it will depend on the continuing interest
of myself and readers. By all means let me know your interests, albeit since
you're not paying me mine take priority. :-)
