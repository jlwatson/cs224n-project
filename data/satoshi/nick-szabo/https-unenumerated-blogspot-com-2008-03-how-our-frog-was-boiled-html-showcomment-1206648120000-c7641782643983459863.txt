 _What next with the boiled frog?_  
  
The boiled frog is dead. However, parts of it would make a good meal for the
next political system to come along. Here are some lights at the end of the
tunnel:  
  
(1) The Internet is trumping the traditional one-way megaphone press, and the
associated growing consciousness of just how narrow and biased the traditional
mass media has been towards government power. But for this we must be patient.
The Ron Paul movement was a sneak preview that Internet culture is very
different from traditional media culture. But it will probably take a
generation or more for the ramifications of this to work out, so riding this
wave requires patience.  
  
(2) Almost every year a new government is formed somewhere, and these days
that usually means writing a new constitution. They need good advice, and
libertarians should be there to provide solid, practical advice, not just
complaints and theories.  
  
(3) Reduce our dependence on governments through things like smart contracts.  
  
Also, here's an answer I wrote a few months ago: ways to make a political
difference.
