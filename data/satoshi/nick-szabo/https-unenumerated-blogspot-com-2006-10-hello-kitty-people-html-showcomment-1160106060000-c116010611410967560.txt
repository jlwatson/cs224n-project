Thanks Mike. I agree with you Adam. The law, auditing, and accounting are
largely made up of such human-essential steps, but objectivity and
verifiability -- rule and process -- are prized where possible.  
  
But Carr didn't make that kind of point. He was just arguing from an implicit
sentiment with which we are all supposed to automatically agree: robot bad,
human good. Using a mechanical authority is just a priori bad in his Hello
Kitty universe, and various surface flaws are cause for giving up on a
potentially verifiable and very efficient algorithm in favor of an imaginary
trusted authority.  
  
From what I can gather, the MLK embarassment is caused not by gaming, nor by
widespread support for the racist site, but by so many people linking to the
site as an example of the idiocy of racism. Unintended consequences. If those
linking opponents think the site's high search engine rating is important
enough of a problem they will just stop linking to the site and the rating
will tank.  
  
Personally, I'd prefer a simple and public (ideally open source) algorithm to
one that is completely fair and game-proof. I'm much more worried about hidden
gaming by the search engines themselves, and related insiders -- as for
example with the Chinese version of search engines -- than with open public
gaming of a well-known algorithm.
