For the temporal
phases of contracting we use the following schema, classified according to the
two-phase model used in economics:



     Ex-Ante Search Negotiation Commitment Ex-Post Performance Adjudication


Smart contracts often involve trusted third parties, exemplified by an
intermediary, who is involved in the performance, and an adjudicator, who is
invoked to resolve disputes arising out of performance (or lack thereof).
Intermediaries can operate during search, negotiation, commitment, and/or
performance. Hidden knowledge, or adverse selection, occurs ex-ante; hidden
actions (moral hazards) occur ex-post.

Here are some examples of contemporary electronic commerce activities and the
phases of contracting they deal with:

     EDI commitment, performance Contract drafting negotiations Web surfing search Payment performance Online exchange search, negotiation, commitment "I agree" button commitment
