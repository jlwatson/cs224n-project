I suspect humans have genetic tendencies to hunter-gatherer ethics, which is
why so many people find sports entertaining but market competition unfair. We
have to overcome these instincts with highly evolved, i.e. civilized culture
if we are to be able to cooperate in groups larger than a hunter-gatherer band
or a football team.  
  
There's a Rawlsian argument to be made for "social insurance" along the
following lines. Rawls postulated a "veil of ignorance," a hypothetical
situation in which we can make agreements without knowing what our lot in life
is. After we make these agreements we are randomly born into some kind of
family (rich or poor with the odds of being born such distributed as per the
actual population). It can be argued that, if we could make binding contracts
behind the veil of ignorance, we'd all rationally sign up for insurance
policies for unemployment, disability, pension, etc. insurance, with everybody
promising to pay the same premium. Since we can't do this, the argument goes,
the government should do it for us with premiums in the form of taxes.  
  
The argument has two main problems: (1) the problem every insurance scheme
faces, that of moral hazard, and (2) the value measurement problem -- we don't
really know what peoples' risk and time preferences are, especially behind the
veil of ignorance.  
  
Despite these problems, I think implied contract reasoning at least serves to
reason about areas where markets and other contractual institutions have not
(yet) come up with a solution. This should at least be helpful to identifying
legal roadblocks to and business opportunities for creating such solutions.
