 _How? The only information that it has is the amount of bitgold mined each
week._  
  
There's a heck of a lot more information than that. For example, traders know
the prices of bit gold vs. precious metals and other currencies, thus can make
good estimates of the current value of bit gold. Based on bit gold production
and public technical information they can make pretty good guesses about what
it costs or cost during a period to mine bit gold. Knowing this information
they can make good estimates of miners' profit margins. Those are a few but
far short of all the kinds of information traders will have available to
bargain with miners and each other to set the different prices of the
different periods.  
  
I'm puzzled, BTW, that your contribution to this discussion seems to consist
solely of criticisms rather than positive suggestions for improvement. Many of
the criticisms are interesting and I appreciate them, but you would come
across quite a bit better if you tried to propose solutions to at least some
of the problems you raise, instead of seeming to suggest that they are
insoluble. Since I have in fact solved many of them, and nobody has made a
good argument showing that the others can't be solved, such a conclusion would
be quite silly.
