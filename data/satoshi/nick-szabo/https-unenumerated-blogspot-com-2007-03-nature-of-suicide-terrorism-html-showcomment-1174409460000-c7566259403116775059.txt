Pape has a whole chapter on this: "Learning Terrorism Pays." The first suicide
bombing in the modern era (Lebanon in 1983) succeeded in driving the U.S.
troops out -- the first major success which has inspired the movement since.
There have been a number of successes that though of ambiguous cause
terrorists attributed to suicide bombing, such as when Israel released Shiek
Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, from prison in 1997 following
both a spate of suicide bombings and diplomatic pressure from the U.S. and
Jordan. Pape recognizes looks at particular campaigns, or series of terrorist
attacks that seem to have distinct start and end times. "Of 13 suicide
terrorist campaigns that were completed during 1980-2003, seven correlate with
significant policy changes by the target state towards the terrorist's major
political goals...even a 50% success rate is remarkable: international
military and economic coercion generally works less than a third of the time,
and is especially rare for groups with few other options."
