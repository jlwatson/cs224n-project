 _Hey nick, why do you care whether the singularity idea is wrong or not?_  
  
Well I mostly didn't care much about it until last night, when I got a bee in
my bonnet. :-) Maybe I won't care about it tomorrow, either, who knows.
Predicting what I'm going to care about in the future is my own individual
singularity. :-)  
  
Currently, however, I am bugged by certain friends, who shall remain nameless,
who insist that conversations be dominated by bad analogies ("singularity"),
vague hypotheticals ("general intelligence"), and the like. For a long time I
have preferred studying things that have actually happened (e.g. law, actual
technology, history) to things that might or might not happen according to
vague imaginings. That way my brain gets filled with real information rather
than junk and I actually have a better grasp on what might happen in the
future than people who don't understand the past. IMHO, your mileage may vary,
etc.
