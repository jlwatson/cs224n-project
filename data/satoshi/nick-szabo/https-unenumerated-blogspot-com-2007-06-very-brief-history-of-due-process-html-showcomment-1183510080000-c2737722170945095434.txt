Well, I did say "very brief", and so, along with cutting out many important
developments within the legal community, I cut out all ideas outside of that
community that influenced (or in this case, should have influenced but failed
to) its development. I also gave shockingly short shrift to the natural rights
tradition, which had a very big influence on substantive due process. And
alas, Hayek did not come along soon enough to save us from Footnote Four, nor
forcefully enough to create a strong movement to overturn that precedent.
