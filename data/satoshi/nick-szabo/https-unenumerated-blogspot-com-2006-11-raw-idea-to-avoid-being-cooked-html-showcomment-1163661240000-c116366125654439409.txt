Brian, I'm sure you know much more about the Space Elevator than I. Feel free
to let us know!  
  
Although a space elevator may provide a nice alternative to manufacturing the
shade in space, there may be synergy as well. A full elevator would be
centered at geosynchronous orbit. It will be (at least before the elevator
itself is built) much cheaper, give the infrastructure I have outlined, to get
material to geosynchronous orbit from comets and asteroids than from the
earth's surface via rocket. And methane ice might make a quite reasonable raw
material for carbon nanotube tethers, or at the very least for the
counterweight.  
  
If the main limit on the manufacturing costs of carbon nanotube is energy
costs, I have an idea for that too. (It won't solve energy problems on earth,
though). A post for another day.
