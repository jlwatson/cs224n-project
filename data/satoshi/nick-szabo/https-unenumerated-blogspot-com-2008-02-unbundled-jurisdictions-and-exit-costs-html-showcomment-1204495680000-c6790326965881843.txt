 _(1) right of conquest, e.g. to pillage and plunder. Euphemism: none; in the
Middle Ages lawyers were honest and called it "right of conquest."_  
  
In more recent times, though, we've had euphemisms like "the divine right of
kings."  
  
It doesn't pay to delve too far back into titles to political power or real
property. If you do, you'll find yourself agreeing with Proudhon that
"property is theft", a recipe for totalitarianism and economic disaster.  
  
The main legitimacy I recognize is that of prescription, a.k.a. adverse
possession -- if somebody has been holding political power or real property
for a long time without sustained protest, they have gained property rights to
it. The time period for holding without protest is shorter for economic than
political property, as it is usually much easier to protest unjust holding of
the former than of the latter.
