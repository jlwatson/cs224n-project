In "The Playdough Protocols" I described how ancient Sumerians used tamper
evidence both in the form of physical seals and in the form of tamper evident
numbers, in particular checksums. These are forerunners both of modern plastic
sealing (used for evidence bags, in banking to store and transport cash and
other valuables, to protect food from tampering, and so on) and modern
cryptographic hash functions, whereby one can detect whether digital content
has been altered.  
  
Daniel Nagy has uncovered a more particular connection between ancient
auditing techniques and modern cryptography. He writes how Chinese merchants,
at least as far back as the 3rd century A.D., used remainders of division by
prime numbers instead of checksums to ensure that nothing had been stolen from
storage or cargo. The security of the Chinese system was based on what we
still call the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The theorem is also used in some
modern cryptographic systems based on the difficulty of factoring, and in
particular the RSA scheme for decryption and digital signatures.
