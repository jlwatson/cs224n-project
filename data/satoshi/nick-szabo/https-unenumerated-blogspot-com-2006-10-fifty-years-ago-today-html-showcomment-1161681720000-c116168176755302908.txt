Alas, I am not fluent in or otherwise terribly knowledgable about Hungarian.
But I do know a bit about semantics and the metaphorical nature of language,
so I'll take a stab at this. A bit of research reveals that szabad can mean
"free," "allowed," "loose," "clear," "in the open," or "vacant." Szabo means
"tailor" and derives from szab "to cut," thus literally "cutter."  
  
Other related words are (I'm leaving off the accent marks, sorry):  
  
\- szabaly (a rule, as in a contract or a statute),  
  
\- hatart szab (to define, delimit, or limit, where "hatar" by itself means
"border"), and  
  
\- szabalyozo (a physical device that regulates action or maintains separation
between parts, as in a recoil checking device, baffle, thermostat, etc.)  
  
Perhaps there's a metaphor of separation of space or of objects at work here:
an act of separation (szab), the state of being separated and thus free to
move(szabad), and something that maintains separation or movement, perhaps by
restricting movement (szabaly). This leads to a variety words for constraints
and freedom from constraints. Thus we might postulate a common root "szab" as
freedom of movement (think of the primordial Magyar nomad on horseback), and
of physical separation via a loosening or a cutting, with "szabaly" a physical
or metaphorical regulation.  
  
Even if the similarities are accidental, there's a connection insofar as
cutting the red star out of the flag is a symbol of freedom. :-)  
  
FWIW, Hungarian "sz" is pronounced like English "s" and "s" like English "sh."
Different choices in mapping the Roman alphabet onto alien languages with a
larger set of phonemes than the Roman letters.  
  
"Give me wide open spaces...", low exit costs, and flags that I can see the
sky through!
