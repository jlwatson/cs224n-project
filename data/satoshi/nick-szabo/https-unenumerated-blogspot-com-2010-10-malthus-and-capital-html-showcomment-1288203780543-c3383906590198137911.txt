Leonard, assuming fully secure property rights, AFAIK a decrease in the lord's
costs doesn't change the revenue maximizing rent, either short or long term,
unless there is competition between lords for tenants. Without such
competition, lords would make more profits by pocketing all the cost savings.
I don't see how the lord's ability to sell estates (alienability) changes
this.  
  
Mobility of tenants can change it, because it turns local monopolies into a
more competitive market for tenants. So we need the combination of lower
security costs _and_ competition for mobile tenants for the security costs to
be passed through to tenants.  
  
The above assumes fully secure property rights, but another effect might make
the outcome you are arguing for work: the threat of being conquered. Rulers
who fear being conquered are likely to act more like a roving bandit,
preventing accumulation of capital or even destroying capital in order to
preserve their realm's future revenues for themselves. A move from a more
roving-bandit-like Laffer curve to a stationary bandit Laffer curve would
lower the Laffer-maximum rent/tax rate for territorial monopolies, so in that
case we'd see rent lowering even without increased mobility of tenants.
