Sometimes message can be altered (e.g. by summary) and not considered by the
rules a "lie." Direct unaltered messaging can be accomplished by cryptography,
(specifically by hash functions, plus, if origins need to be authenticated,
digital signatures). "Lie" in the context of the property title registry
consists in violating the title transfer rules or corrupting the database,
e.g. by pruning part of the "tree" of transferred and subdivided property
titles.
