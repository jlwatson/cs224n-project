The main (and most practical) legal justifications for medieval property
ownership (or tenure, as the grantor often reserved military service or other
conditions) were (1) prescription (I've been using the property therefore I
own it), and (2) conquest (which essentially amounted to saying that one has a
duty to protect land militarily, and the former owner didn't do it, so I did).
My paper describes a debate between the descendants of William the Conqueror
and his officers as to whether his officers owned their land (and appurtenant
jurisdictions) alloidally or by grant from their military commander, the king.  
  
The Church claimed that its jurisdiction over family law and similar was held
of God (via the pope) and not of the king; up to Henry VIII this claim was
generally respected.  
  
"Peer to peer" describes the structure of the franchise/trespass system after
property has been granted: in mathematical terms, a cyclic graph, in contrast
to the hierarchy (mathematical tree) of the Roman imperial and most modern
judicial review. The original property grants were (in theory, although
alloidalists disputed the theory and prescription was a huge exception to it)
derived from the king in a hierarchical structure of tenure, but this played
only one substantial role for jurisdictional franchises once they had been
granted: the king's reservation of ability to referee the jurisdiction and
procedures of franchise courts via the extraordinary writs.
