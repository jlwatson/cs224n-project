DN: [Why arbitrary, secret, no right of appeal, not right for inviter to
defend case, etc.]  
  
I'm not well versed in the details of travel and immigration law (indeed with
your travel experience you probabably know far more than me in this area), so
I'm afraid I'm not the person to ask for justifications of specific aspects of
the law or procedure. But I strongly suspect they are justified by the general
policy reasons outlined in my last comment, combined with the desire to make
the procedures highly efficient. Allowing hearings, trials, appeals, etc.
would make the whole process very costly and, if those costs were monetarily
imposed on travellers, likely deter rather than encourage international
travel.  
  
There's a chance that international traveller and terrorist databases might
allow more informed decisions at less cost, but these create their own risks
of abuse as well.
