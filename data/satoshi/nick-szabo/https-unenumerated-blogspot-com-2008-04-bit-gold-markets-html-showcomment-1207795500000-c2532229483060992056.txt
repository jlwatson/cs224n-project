Even if diamond scarcity had more to do with cartel behavior than with geology
(it doesn't, but let's go with that), as long as people believe in the
scarcity, they are still valuing the diamond almost entirely for its scarcity,
not its sparkle. One can get nice sparkle from any number of cheap goo-gaws,
but it won't be the sparkle of scarcity that signals true love.  
  
As for why diamonds went retail, with the first and greatest success in the
U.S., there's far more to it than De Beers ad campaigns. The most successful
marketing campaigns identify and trigger already latent demand, they don't
create demand from scratch. During the period diamonds took off in the U.S.
there were changes in family law that made engagement and marriage less
expensive commitments for men. Women demanded a credible substitute,
collateral with monetary properties that didn't look too much like money, and
got it.
