Daniel, that's very interesting and informative crypto stuff, thanks. If you
want to write up a small article the topic of advanced blind signatures, and
if you can think of a simplified description of your own scheme, I'd be happy
to have you guest-post on the subject.  
  
DN: "The problem with all the other blinding schemes is that they require (at
least) an extra round of communication."  
  
I didn't know this, and I agree it is pretty expensive.  
  
I think we should also look at the attack model. It doesn't pay for the
attacker to spend more than a dollar of CPU time to break the signature on a
dollar "coin." The typical crypto key size requires far more than trillions of
dollars worth of CPU cycles to crack. Although one must handle the risk of
cracking algorithmic improvvements -- but there are ways to do this besides
key size overkill -- I think the key sizes can be much smaller for low-
denomination coins.  
  
In comparison to another privacy model that is less than fully strong crypto,
the appropriate blinding operation can also can have a small key size,
although I don't know if that is significant in the scheme of things.  
  
DN: "[WebMoney] actually walked the extra mile of placing the two TPs in
different jurisdictions."  
  
This is a good idea, assuming the jurisdictions are sufficiently independent.
I'm not convinced it's sufficient to protect against what happened to e-gold,
or against various similar threats, but it does seem to be a significcant
improvement.
