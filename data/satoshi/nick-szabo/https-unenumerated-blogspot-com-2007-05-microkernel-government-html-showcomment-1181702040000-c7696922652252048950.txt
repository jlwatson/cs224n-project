"Unless you can find a way to connect the Romanist-absolutist and Progressive
traditions..."  
  
Allow me to clarify my terminology. I've been using "Romanist" in the broad
sense of anybody who believes in sovereign power (in contrast to severe
federalism, franchises, taking the law into one's own hands, and so on).
Here's a breakdown of subcategories of Romanists:  
  
A Byzantist believes that all sovereignty -- the zenith of all executive,
legislative, and judicial power -- lies in a supreme leader (in Byzantium,
that was Justinian and the other emperors).  
  
A Cromwellian (I've been using the term "Bagehotist") believes that
sovereignty lies in an elected body. Jefferson and Franklin were also close to
believing this.  
  
Both kinds of Romanists in their pure form believe in arbitrary legislative
powers. In contrast the old Anglo-Norman Parliament restricted its statutes to
certain categories: generally grants of property (including political
property, a.k.a. franchises) and treaties. In Juristopia the Board of
Directors may only grant political property rights -- it may neither set taxes
nor engage in other kinds of legislation (I neglected treaties). Also in
contrast is the corporate system (like the U.S.) where statutes are by-laws
that may not conflict with the articles of incorporation. Also in contrast are
natural law restrictions on legislation, a la Locke.  
  
There are probably many Romanist connections to Progressivism, but the most
obvious to me is its deprecation of both charter rights and traditional
natural rights in favor of a Cromwellian assertion of arbitrary rights to
legislate in the "economic" sphere. Thus Footnote Four.
