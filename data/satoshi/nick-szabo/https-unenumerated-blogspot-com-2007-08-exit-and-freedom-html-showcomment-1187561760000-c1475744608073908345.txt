DN: "why at all are foreigners considered more dangerous than citizens?"  
  
Foreigners are considered to be more likely to be dangerous for a large number
of reasons, some of which I sympathize with:  
  
* There are far more of them than there are citizens, and from a wider variety of cultural and political backgrounds, so one has to put up with a much greater variety of both legal and illegal behavior from them.  
  
* They often come here in whole or in part for the greater taxpayer-funded goodies.  
  
* They are more likely than citizens to be terrorists (a massively overhyped problem since 9/11 to be sure, but even accounting for that still an important factor to be considered).  
  
* They might be enemy state spies or sabateurs.  
  
* They might be part of an unassimalable population that doesn't much speak the standard language in the jurisdiction and thus presents a threat of future political violence (a la the Balkans). I'm not going to go through all the reasons this could be so here, the case has been well-argued elsewhere. But from a legal point of view I'd say that a large population that cannot read laws in the language they were written in, a population that drafts its contracts and wills in a language different from those under which legal interpretation standards have been developed, a population that cannot serve on a jury or testify in court in a language the lawyers, judge, and jury can understand, yet that population demands equal legal and political rights, presents an unacceptable legal and political burden and risk.  
  
There are some potential solutions to these besides border checks and
restraints.  
  
* We could stop providing taxpayer-funded goodies generally. A far superior solution to border restrictions, but alas seems rather politically distant.  
  
* We might depend on internal police to ferret out spies, sabateurs and terrorists. But putting all the burden on internal police might well demand sacrifices in internal procedural freedoms for all of us, in place of sacrifices of procedural freedoms at the border. I'm not sure that's a good tradeoff.  
  
* We could let in everybody regardless of their English skills but let our courts then say "tough luck" to people who want to testify in a language the judge, jury, and lawyers do not understand (currently interpreters are used, but that's quite awkward and prone to errors and manipulations), or to contracts and wills not drafted in the standard legal language under which interpretational precedents have been set. Courts could stop pretending that we should or can provide people who don't speak the legal language with the same legal rights as those who do. (Any more than the Internet will let computers that don't talk IP communicate on an equal basis with those that do).   
  
Because of the high costs in internal as well as external freedom that come
from travel restrictions (per my original blog post), I'm not sure any or even
all of these reasons put together are worth the problems and risks of allowing
governments to restrict movements across borders. Many of them involve basic
tradeoffs between border freedom and internal freedom. All of them are
important considerations that can't be dismissed, nor is their any prospect of
them being minimized in the political debate over borders.
