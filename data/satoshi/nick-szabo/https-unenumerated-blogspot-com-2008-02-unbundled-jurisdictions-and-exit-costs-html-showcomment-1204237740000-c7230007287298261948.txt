 _I get the impression that the old forms of legal property were
nonstransferable and the owner couldn't even alter the rules of succession,
but maybe that's wrong._  
  
To oversimplify, one could usually sell, but not mortgage or alter inheritence
by will franchises. When, as was often the case, they were attached to
("appurtenant" as we say in property law) another property, they were governed
by any alienability restrictions on that property. They often becamed
partitioned under inheritence (with the strange effect that women often got
the franchises as their share and the oldest son got the real property -- this
under the now obsolete primogeniture laws).  
  
 _I get the impression the new ones would be transferable and would probably
be held by corporations rather than individuals._  
  
We'd need to experiment to see what works, but generally speaking yes.  
  
 _Let's say that I own the right to execute capital criminals within San Mateo
county. Presumably I don't have anything to do with apprehending or convicting
criminals (unless I happen to own thsoe rights also). Does that mean someone
has to pay whatever fee I charge or the felons remain unexecuted? Or can they
just be shipped over to Alameda and executed there?_  
  
Good question, thanks.  
  
Franchises are a legal monopoly and their fees are capped by juries to allow
for "reasonable" profits only. Whether they can be shipped to Alameda county
depends on whether the monopoly is over executions conducted _within_ San
Mateo county or is over executions for crimes committed in San Mateo county.
We should prefer the former, more competitive solution unless the competition
would cause (as in the tax case) more problems than it solves.
