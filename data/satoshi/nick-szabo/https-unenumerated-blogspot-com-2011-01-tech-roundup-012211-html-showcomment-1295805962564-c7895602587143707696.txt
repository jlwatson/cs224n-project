Old Farragut: good question. Atoms per se are cheap. We don't need more mass
to solve any of the major problems we have in the developed world. Even living
space is cheap in most countries. Land is nearly free in most areas of Russia,
North America, and Australia -- it's just living space near the people we want
to live near that is expensive.  
  
This suggests, contrary to what our religious instincts dream about, that down
is better. Partly to find more of the more useful kinds of atoms (mining the
vasty deep) but mostly to open up the valuable real estate below our cities.
Building ever bigger skyscrapers is good too, but I don't see anything on the
horizon that is stronger yet as cheap as steel.  
  
But few buildings are actually built to the limits of steel, so the even more
important problem to solve in real estate is a political incentives problem --
people who already own real estate have a strong incentive to organize
politically and gang up on developers (yes you read that correctly) to enhance
the scarcity of what they own. We need cities that credibly commit, in a hard-
to-amend city charter, to ditch zoning and other political control over
development in favor of a strong property rights regime.
