Graham Asher:  
 _It is more likely that intelligence increased slowly over a long period,
eventually reaching the required threshold in some areas._  
Gradual genetic imrovement (or even abrupt genetic improvement) doesn't
explain the abrupt yet dispersed nature of the transition: why after 100,000
years agriculture appeared in widely disparate and genetically distinct parts
of the globe (Middle East, Far East, New Guinea, and the Americas) within the
space of a few thousand years.  
  
More likely is a meme, probably related to small groups securing capital
investments (applicable to both fixed for plants or mobile for animal herding)
instead of larger hunting areas. Alas, the nature and spread of such a meme is
hard to reconstruct. A good approach would be a comparison between cultures
where this meme apparently spread, e.g. New Guinea, with areas where it
apparently did not, e.g. Australia which lacked agriculture. AFAIK nobody has
made such a study, but I would be very happy to learn of references about such
studies.
