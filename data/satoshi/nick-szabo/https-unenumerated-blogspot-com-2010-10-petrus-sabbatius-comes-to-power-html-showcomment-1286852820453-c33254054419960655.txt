 _I read that Christianity did away with using high standing as proof of
virtue_  
  
That's definitely true of early Christians, and to some extent remained true
for Western Orthodox Christians, but Eastern Orthodox Christians were if
anything accentuating leadership as a sign of virtue by the time of Justin.
Christian Roman emperors were considered (or at least considered themselves)
"elected" by God as well as secondarily by the army, palace guards, senate and
"the people" (acclaim of the Hippodrome crowd). In contrast to Western leaders
(esp. between 1100 and 1500) they were caesaropapist: heads Church as well as
heads of State.  
  
Christian Roman artwork often depicted a celestial hierarchy of angels,
prophets, apostles, etc. which basically look like the depictions of the
emperor and his tax collector and military hierarchies except that the angels
have wings.  
  
Comparing between the pagan emperor (often loosely to seriously spoken of as
the son of a god, because they were usually sons, even if adopted, of emperors
deified when deceased), and the Eastern Orthodox caesaropapist model, it's
hard to say which one had more divine authority or virtue imputed by same.  
  
 _I've also read that Romans valued cruelty in their leaders. Is this true?_  
  
The pagan Romans valued cruelty rather generally unless directed at their own
family. After Christians came there was still quite a bit of cruelty, in
particular judicial and tax collection torture were retained, but they were
usually ashamed of it and tried to deny or hide it, and did away with public
spectacles featuring cruelty such as the gladiatorial games.
