gwern, that's a great point about selection pressures. Ultimately the question
is a scientific one but at this point it's rather philosophical. Is evolution
stuck in a certain basic design and can't get out of it for reasons of genetic
distance? (e.g. for the same reason an alligator can't just mutate into a
chicken, even though both forms are possible)? Or is it that it is simply
impossible for life to exist anywhere without amino acids and phosphates? I
doubt that anybody at this point knows the answer to that question.  
  
As for nutrient limits, you've made a good restatement of Liebig's principle.
I should add that, except where evolution is "stuck", Liebig's principle
applies only over the short term. Often in the long term evolution can evolve
to reduce its use of given nutrients (e.g. as it adapted to land by using less
water). But per the first paragraph there are limits beyond which life hasn't
evolved -- we certainly never evolved to be as dry as the land environment
around us, and we still all need carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous.
