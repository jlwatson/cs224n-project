to future generations is to oppose any movement towards world government,
e.g., to oppose any augmentation of the UN's ability to tax or coerce people.'  
  
This is a very good observation. But there is a strong pressure to standardize
law internationally to lower transaction costs and deal with international
pollution. This will continue to give rise to entities like the WTO and
international FDA- and EPA-like organizations. The trick is to do this without
empowering international tax collection or more long-arm taxation.
