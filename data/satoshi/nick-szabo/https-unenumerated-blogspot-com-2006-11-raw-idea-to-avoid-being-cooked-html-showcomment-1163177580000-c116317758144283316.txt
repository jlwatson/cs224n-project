Brian, I think it's much better than SDI might have been in that regard, since
it develops an infrastructure that vastly reduces transport costs beyondy
earth orbit as well as the cost of many industrial raw materials such as water
and various organics. It enables quite a number of new activities, including
affordable interplanetary space tourism, asteroid mining (for platinum etc.)
and microgravity industry with inexpensive inputs. These activities won't much
look like the traditional NASA and Russian space programs.  
  
My answer to Paul's question is another example. The blinds can't increase
sunlight to the earth beyond the natural level just by moving them to the
other side of the earth, because they are somwhat irregularly refractive, not
regularly reflective. But the same technology that transports raw materials
and most of the technology that manufactures the blinds can be used to make
regularly reflective mirrors to warm the earth up, should Paul's scenario
occur.  
  
Furthermore, similar mirror technology can be used to warm up Mars if we so
wish, to melt asteroids, and provide extra illumination at most places in the
outer solar system where sombody might want to set up shop.
