Holland, and in particular Amsterdam, did indeed have a small head start on
capitalist institutions, and possibly a bit of head start on rising literacy,
and had the first large-scale joint stock company, the Dutch East India
Company. Holland inherited much from the long history of textile manufacturing
and commodity trading in the Low Countries (mostly in what is today Belgium,
before the Reformation war for secession from Spain gave rise to Amsterdam).
