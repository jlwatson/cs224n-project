All interesting, but WMG suffers from the same basic vulnerability  as e-gold
and similar systems, as amply demonstrated by the recent e-gold woes. What
legal and security protections is does WMG have in place to avoid a repeat of
the forfeitures suffered by e-gold and its customers, and as suffered by
holders of gold throughout history?
