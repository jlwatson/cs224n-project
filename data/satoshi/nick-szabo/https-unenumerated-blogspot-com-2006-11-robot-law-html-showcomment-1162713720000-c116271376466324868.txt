I got my version of the derivation of "trespass" in an admittedly offhand way,
by consulting with a French speaker who, I guess, guessed that the Old French
came from the Latin "passus" or "step" (actually "two steps") and "tres" was
like the modern "tres" an adverbial form of "very." That construction sounds
awkward translated literally: "take two steps largely" or similar.  
  
The Latin equivalent phrase for "trespass" in the medieval English literature
was "transgressio," literally meaning to move across: compare "agress" (move
against), "ingress" (move in), "egress" (move out), "digress" (move apart),
"congress" (move together), etc.  
  
I'm somewhat skeptical about Webster's derivation that says "tres" meant
"trans" rather than an adverbial version of "very" as in modern French. I can
imagine it did mean this to the English lawyers, who readily translated
between "trespass" and "transgressio." And I can certainly believe that
"passer" was by medieval times as in modern French (to pass) rather than the
Latin noun "passus", i.e. "two steps" from which it may have derived. So my
revised hunch is that at least the Norman French at the time meant something
like "pass substantially" (i.e. as opposed to a _de minimus_ or accidental
passage).  
  
Even if my derivation is silly, I think the point I thought it might support
is valid: one tries, by looking at evidence such as the direction and
magnitude of the movement, and whether there was notice of the surface, to
make a distinction between accidential and purposeful crossings of the
surface.
