Leonard, new crops are definitely good places to look at. But as it turned out
the most important crop didn't come from the new world.  
  
The most important innovations down on the farm weren't patented, but I am
confident that the general culture of experimentation and improvement played a
role. And more abstract science may have played a role, albeit if so in a non-
obvious way, as the leading experts of the day had theories and opinions
rather opposed to the most productive innovations, and any understanding
either farmers or scientists had of why their innovations were working was
extremely poor from our point of view which is much better informed about the
science.  
  
All fodder, as it were, for future posts.
