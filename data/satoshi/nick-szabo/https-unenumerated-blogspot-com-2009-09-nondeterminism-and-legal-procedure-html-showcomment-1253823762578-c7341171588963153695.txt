xon, you're probably right, but it's somewhat incomparable in that the prima
facie case refers to only one partisan's presentation of the case (i.e. it
ignores rebuttal evidence), whereas in probable cause the argument must
withstand the other parties' rebuttal evidence. Albeit another difference is
that probable cause refers more to the reasonable beliefs of an actor (e.g. a
police officer deciding to make an arrest), not to the totality of the
evidence.  
  
Here's an example ripped from Wikipedia but extended by me. Police officer
walks into the bar, and sees Jim, John, and Joe all standing next to the
smoking gun and the murder victim. Just that information is insufficient for
probable cause to arrest any one of them. However, a prima facie argument "Joe
was standing next to the smoking gun" sounds pretty good without the rebuttal
evidence that so were Jim and John.  
  
However, that's a somewhat concocted example, so prima facie may well belong
below probable cause on the list.
