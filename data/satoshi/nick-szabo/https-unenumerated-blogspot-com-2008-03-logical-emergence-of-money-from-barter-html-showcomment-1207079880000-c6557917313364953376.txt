 _You have either reverted the definition of "transaction cost" to the
inability to teleport objects backward in time, or are continuing to lawyer
the word "negligible." Or something else._  
  
"Something else", a very specific something else which is by now more than
obvious to anybody with any familiarity with economics who has read what I
have written. I am not going to repeat myself for a fourth time, for crying
out loud. You are obviously either not reading what I have written, or are
deliberately ignoring it for strategic reasons. Either way, I am talking to a
brick wall and there is no point in my continuing to attempt such futile
communications.
