 _Much (how much hard to pin down?) comes from trading and hoarding. We
shouldn't stand for our oil prices being gamed up by trading interests.
Wouldn't a little sales tax on commodity transfers be a start at doing the
trick?_  
  
Trading and hoarding are neither irrational nor inefficient, given the
problems with the dollar and dollar-linked currencies. They are as good
attempts as can be made to provide a substitute for the monetary functions of
the dollar, i.e. to provide a store of value and medium of exchange, or in the
case of food stockpiling to make up for the expected lack of ability to change
today's money for tommorrow's food. Slowing down the commodities market now
would be like slowing down your immune system when you have the flu. It might
reduce your fever for a while, but it will let the flu destroy you.  
  
Treating the symptoms rather than the disease is, alas, quite popular. It
occurred during the 1970s with WIN ("Whip Inflation Now") buttons, price
controls, gasoline rationing, investments in energy conservation (Jimmy Carter
in his nice thick wool sweater asking folks to please turn down their
thermostats), and a wide variety of other such nonsense we see being repeated
with slight variations today. Nothing worked until the Fed led by Paul Volker
dared to reign in the supply of dollars, despite causing a recession in the
process.
