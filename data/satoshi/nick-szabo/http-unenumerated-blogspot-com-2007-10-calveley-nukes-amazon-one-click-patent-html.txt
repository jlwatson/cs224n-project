Peter Calveley has succeeded in getting the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
(USPTO) to throw out most of the claims in Amazon's infamous one-click patent,
including the broadest claims. Amazon now has an opportunity to respond and
convince the USPTO to change its mind, but its prospects are dim. From Peter's
report:  

> In a recent office action, the USPTO has rejected the claims of the
Amazon.com one-click patent following the re-examination request that I filed
on 16 February 2006.  
>  
> My review resulted in the broadest claims of the patent being ruled invalid.  
>  
> In its Office Action released 9 October 2007, the Patent Office found that
the prior art I found and submitted completely anticipated the broadest claims
of the patent, U.S. Patent No. 5,960,411.  
>  
> I had only requested the USPTO look at claims 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21 and 22
but the Office Action rejects claims 11-26 and claims 1-5 as well!

I reported on this soon after it got started and am proud to have assisted
Peter in this endeavor. Here is Peter's full report.
