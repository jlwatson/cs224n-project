 _This problem, that money tends to monopoly, and monopoly tends to be abused,
would be somewhat diminished if we had software that eased the management of
multiple monies._  
  
I wholeheartedly agree with this, but reach even further: there is no known
limit to how much the monopoly money problem can be diminished with software,
via the reduction of mental transaction costs. Indeed, for certain narrow
contractual problems (estimating and hedging risk), computerized derivatives
have reduced mental transaction costs by factors often of millions, making
possible a whole new world of contracts that were impossible before.  
  
As for consumer transactions, there is a vast space of possible user
interfaces, and of different metaphors for representing contractual terms,
only a small fraction of which can reduce mental transactions at all, but some
of which may dramatically reduce mental transaction costs and put the
monopoly-money problem on the dustbin of history. We've got to keep trying to
see how far we can reduce the mental transaction costs of multiple currencies.
