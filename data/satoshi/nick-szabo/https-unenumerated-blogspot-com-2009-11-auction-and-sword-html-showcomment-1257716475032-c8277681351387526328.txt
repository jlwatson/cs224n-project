The laws regarding succession were anything but formalism in the real sense,
i.e. in successions real actions departed from any rules more than they
followed them (and of course, succession is the one place where even so
sweeping a statement as "the emperor's will is law" breaks down -- even if
we're willing to blindly obey one man, like soldiers obey their military
superiors, first we have to answer the question, who is that one man?). The
Severan jurists (esp. Papinian and Ulpian) were straightforward enough in
support of their masters to flout Republican laws of political procedure
(still nominally in force until Ulpian delivered the coup de grace with his
encyclopedic digest of the laws of the Empire) but even they didn't have the
balls to admit that the real law of succession in imperial Rome was "might
makes right (to rule)".
