nazgulnarsil, that's basically the only time the "voting" matters, in an
emergency when there are errors in the network corrupting the messages
(unlikely) or (more importantly) an attack where nodes intentionally corrupt
important properties of the protocol that aren't cryptographically protected.  
  
There are also out-of-band reactions that can occur even if a majority
corrupts the system. For example a minority can fork the block chain in
Bitcoin (or title registry in bit gold) and then try to convince the world
that their transaction history is the correct one and that the corrupt
majority is in error. However, it's not clear what kinds of things can be
proven out-of-band; this is a topic that deserves much further study.  
  
Canonically Byzantine agreement assumed each node had a secure true-name
identity, but because privacy is a desiderata, and because it would be very
difficult to implement such a secure identity system on the Internet, we have
to use some characteristic of users provable within the Bitcoin or bit gold
system to weigh Byzantine "votes". I've now come up with a list of provable
attributes in Bitcoin (or bit gold) by which message correctness "votes" might
be weighed:  
  
* proof-of-work/mining effort (what Bitcoin currently does)  
* value or number of coins or solution bits owned by key  
* number or value of transactions as payor, payee, or both by a key  
* number or value of transactions weighted by how recent they are  
* various combinations of the above  
  
This is an incomplete list, especially if we add new attributes. One of the
general ideas here is to weigh Byzantine "voting" towards those with more
experience in the system, making a novel invasion more difficult. However in a
currency there should also be a balance between various stakeholders (holders,
creditors, and debtors). Since Bitcoin- or bit gold- denominated contracts
generally exist outside the system, one would have to, at the very least,
publicly register those contracts signed by the parties' keys for creditor or
debtor status to be provable.
