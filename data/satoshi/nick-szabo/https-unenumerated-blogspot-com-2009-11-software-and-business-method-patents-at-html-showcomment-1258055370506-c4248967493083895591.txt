Ray, the difference is that if some of the novelty and non-obviousness of a
new robot is in the actual circuit design or mechanism design, that is a
"machine", not just in its programming, and it's not contested that these are
patentable. Also physical processes are patentable, such as new chemical
reactions and reactors.
