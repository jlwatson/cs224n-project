Hi, my apologies for the commenting problems, they come in two forms:  
  
(1) Posts that contain insults directed at specific individuals get deleted as
soon as I discover them.  
  
(2) Blogger is putting many (but puzzling not all) posts that contain links in
the "Spam" category, which means these posts are basically being moderated.  
  
For category (1), please take your idiotic bigotry elsewhere, for category
(2), I apologize and will try to check the Spam queue more frequently as long
as this discussion continues.
