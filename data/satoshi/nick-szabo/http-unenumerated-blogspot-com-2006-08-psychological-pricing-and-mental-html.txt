A common kind of mental transaction cost is demonstrated by psychological
pricing, and in particular the strong tendency to price things at $(X-1).99
instead of $X.00.  
  
As Brian Moore points out, an extra digit is an easy visual way to filter out
higher prices:  
  

> If I see the following prices for gas:  
>  
> .99  
> .98  
> 1.02  
> .89  
>  
> My brain immediately dismisses the 3rd price, then goes back and looks at
the others to find the lowest A seller doesn't want to be eliminated like
that.

Furthermore, we save on mental transaction costs by processing the more
signicant digits first and often ignoring the rest. That fits our habit of
scanning numbers from left to right.
