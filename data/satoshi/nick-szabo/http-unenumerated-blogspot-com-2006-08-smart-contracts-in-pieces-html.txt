One thing I've notice as smart contracts have been evolving (rather
obliviously to the idea of smart contracts) is that they are being implemented
in little pieces. For example, instead of the full-blown protocol I describe
in that article, wherein the ability of one's car to start is automatically
tied to the lateness of one's payments, the "auto repo auto" has been
implemented as a somewhat simpler gizmo that responds to radio signals from a
trusted (and legally regulated) party: a "starter-interrupt device." Instead
of a full-blown market translator, we get simple gizmos like this price-
sensitive thermostat. Both the market translator and the price-sensitive
thermostat reduce mental transaction costs by obtaining consumer preferences
and translating them into purchasing decisions. The price-sensitive thermostat
has the advantage that people already enter their preferences into
thermostats, so there is already a digital source of preferences.
