Daniel, it's great to see you getting through the filters.  
  
DN: "...explain the bit about "national languages" and how they are
advantageous?  
In every country I have seen and those (past and present) that I have read
about, carriers of trans-cultural languages tend to be more successful
economically than those who only speak, read and write in their local national
language."  
  
I'm talking about similar effects but on a smaller scale. Before widespread
literacy, there were many local languages (not merely dialects) for every
national language that eventually emerged. Knowing the national language (the
standard language agreed on by printers, lawyers, and churches, but mainly
printers) made one "inter-tribal" just as knowing multiple languages now can
make one international.  
  
Even more important, but related, is a trust effect. One is more likely to
initially trust another if the two speak the same language. This allows for
much greater cooperation, and thus we see the great increase in the size of
organizations, first the colonial companies (like the East India Company) and
then industrial enterprises.
