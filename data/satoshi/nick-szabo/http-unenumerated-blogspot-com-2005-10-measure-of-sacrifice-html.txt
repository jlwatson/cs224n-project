My article A Measure of Sacrifice explains why  
(1) the kind of contract that dominates most of our lives (i.e., employment)
is usually measured by effort rather than output, and  
(2) why the clock and the sandglass, involving two almost completely different
craft traditions, were invented at the same time and place in history.
