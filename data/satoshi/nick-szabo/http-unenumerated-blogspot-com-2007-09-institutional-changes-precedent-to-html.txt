In the ongoing debate at Marginal Revolution over Gregory Clark's new book _A
Farewell to Alms_ \-- which I highly recommend, despite my criticisms -- he
wrote the following:  
  
"The widespread impression that between 1300 and 1800 England experienced
significant institutional improvements is just wrong. There were changes, yes.
But not improvements."  
  
To which I responded:  

> Some important institutional changes -- some of them arguably radical
improvements -- in England between 1300 and 1800:  
>  
> * The mechanical clock, 14th century. The resulting rise of clock culture
and the time wage may have slowly but radically improved the coordination and
work habits of Europeans. Earlier adaptation to clock culture, a process that
may take centuries to evolve, may explain the large discrepencies between
European and many non-European laborer work habits that Clark cites.  
>  
> * The printing press and the rise of book consciousness, which radically
decreased the costs of teaching economically important knowledge to both
children and adults. The rise of book consciousness, reflected in the literacy
and book cost data Clark graphs, explains the most prominent puzzle revealed
by Clark's data: the fact that skills and innovation rose dramatically even as
the rewards to skills were stagnant or declined.  
>  
> * Nationalization the Church in England and secularization of family law,
16th century.  
>  
> * The incorporation of the Lex Mercatoria into the common law, and the
resulting rise of modern contract law, 18th century. Indeed, much of this
occured in the same decades as the start of the industrial revolution.  
>  
> * The "Romanization" of property law, rendering land more freely saleable,
divisible, and mortgageable, which Adam Smith noted was an important
improvement still in process at his time.  
>  
> * The rise of marine insurance (e.g. Lloyd's of London) and the associated
rise of colonialism and world trade, 17th-18th century.  
>  
> * The decline of guilds and monopolies, 16th-18th centuries. Medieval
England was certainly not a highly competitive market economy. Commerce in
goods was dominated rather by monopolies and a variety of price and quality
controls instituted by guilds and towns.
