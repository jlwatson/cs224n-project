I wrote: _stock prices perform disproportionately better as expected inflation
falls towards zero._  
  
I should add that this effect can be swamped in a credit-crunch deflation,
where expected profits themselves collapse, more than making up for the higher
inverse collectible premium. It works much better when inflation caused by
monetary and fiscal policy diminishes, as in the 1980s and 1990s.  
  
Stagflation hits stock prices in both ways -- credit retraction causes profits
to decline in real terms while loose monetary and fiscal policy decreases the
inverse collectible premium as more assets become invested in housing etc.
rather than stocks. We can add to this witch's brew the extra inefficiencies
caused by mispriced long-term contracts, which should increase costs of long-
term credit and decrease profits. Thus the extremely poor performance, in real
terms, of stock prices in the 1970s.
