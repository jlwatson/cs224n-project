 _This distance may be proportional to the number of voters, in which case the
representation distance of a U.S. Congressional election on our scale is about
6 million._  
  
Oops, in my quick commenting I forgot to revise the result when I revised the
input and in any case I should explain the derivation. The idea is that if one
principal (one voter) has a representation distance of 2 from his
representative, and if the distance is proportional to the number of voters,
than the distance is 2*(600,000) or 1.2 million.  
  
Of course, the assumption is a potentially much larger source of error, i.e.
the distance may be logarithmic or exponential with the number of voters, or
the square root or the square, or something else besides proportional, so the
number is just a possible example.
