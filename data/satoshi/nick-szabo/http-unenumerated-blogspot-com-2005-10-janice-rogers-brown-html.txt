For Associate Justice of the Supreme Court I recommend that President Bush
nominate Judge Janice Rogers Brown, formerly a justice on the California
Supreme Court and currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit.  
  
Alternatively I would recommend Judge Alex Kozinski of the United States Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
