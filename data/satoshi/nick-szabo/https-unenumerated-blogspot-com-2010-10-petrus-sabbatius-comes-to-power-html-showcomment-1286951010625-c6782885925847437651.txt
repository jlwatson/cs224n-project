P.S. by "purely secular" I refer to the secular rulers having no say over
religious doctrine or who holds religious offices (and even in the late Middle
Ages little say over family and related moral law), not to the view of many on
the modern left that the decisions of secular rulers should not be informed or
motivated by their religious beliefs.  
  
Berman, _Law and Revolution_, which TGGP mentioned in another thread had a
good account of the Western Catholic reification of the doctrine of the
separate spiritual and secular jurisdictions in the 11th and 12th centuries.
The idea of not subordinating religion to the secular ruler dates back to
early Christianity (which before being made the official religion of the
Empire was persecuted for refusing to participate in the official civic
religion), and to Augustine who made the distinction between the City of Man
and the City of God. This early Christian tradition of refusing to bow to
secular authority, dealt blows by the Roman imperial apparatus from
Constantine on forward, revived in the West when the Western Empire crumbled
but was largely destroyed in the Eastern Empire by the time of Justinian.
