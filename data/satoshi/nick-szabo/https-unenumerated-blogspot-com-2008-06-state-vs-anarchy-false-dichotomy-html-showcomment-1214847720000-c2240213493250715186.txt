 _the word "government" becomes distasteful to some folks so they hesitate to
describe the type of organization they prefer as such. I can't stand the idea
of enforcing contracts with my own hands (or paving the all the streets I use
by myself), so I am not an anarchist._  
  
There is nothing wrong with private roads, for which there is ample historical
precedent, but with enforce-it-yourself contracts you've put your fingers on
one of the basic problems with anarcho-capitalism.  
  
Most criticisms directed at "government" generally are criticisms of _modern_
governemnts, the only kinds we know, and especially at the results of
legislatures and regulatory bodies. We can't learn much about alternatives
even from most history books, which tend to highly distort historical
institutions through modern lenses (e.g. by treating kings as the hereditary
equivalents of modern dictators. Most of the Western European kings,
especially in the English legal tradition, were nothing of the sort, and
treating medieval politics in this way misses the main unique feature of most
of these systems, i.e. political property rights).  
  
By playing along with the false all-or-nothing dichotomy of modern government
vs. imaginary anarchy, anarchists ignore or distort the real workings of legal
procedure and armed force. Anarchist just play devil's advocate and thereby
help feed the beast they hate most.
