BTW, lest there be any confusion here, I mean "regime" by analogy to the way
scientists use the term: e.g. in physics one can be in the quantum regime
where quantum mechanics applies, in the intermediate regime where Newtonian
models are sufficient, or in the relativistic regime. It's also analogous to
phases of matter: in the solid regime, or gas, or plasma, or so on. Thus
modern market economies operate in a regime of sophisticated tort, property,
etc. laws, but many other human activities have not or do not, so that the
laws of the voluntary-transaction regime of economics often do not apply.  
  
I am not using "regime" in the sense of referring to any specific governments,
and perhaps not even to government generally.
