George, (and anybody else), since I don't know what particular things about
political property rights confuse people, it would be helpful if you prepare a
question or a short list of questions about them. A question might be a
hypothetical ("what happens if X?"), it might be definititional ("what does Y
mean?"), or any other kind of question. The process of preparing the
questions, as well as of me thinking about and answering them, would I suspect
clarify things greatly.
