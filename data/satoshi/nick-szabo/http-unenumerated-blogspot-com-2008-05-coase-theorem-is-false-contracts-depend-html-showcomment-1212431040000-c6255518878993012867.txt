transactions costs that were preventing the fair allocation of resources as
much as the initial allocation._  
  
There are many problems with this sweeping conclusion that Coase and most of
his followers have drawn from trying to reconcile the false Theorem with
observable reality. Besides the logical problem that this conclusion is
derived from a false premise, another huge problem is that it sweeps a very
wide variety of costs under a rug labeled "transaction costs." It suggests an
analogy between any of these costs and broker's fees (that's where the phrase
"transaction cost" comes from), and that perhaps some innovation in bargaining
like computerized trading is all that is required to lower any such cost.
Nothing could be further from reality.  
  
Coercion in particular is in no useful way analogous to a broker's fee. If the
broker's fee is too expensive, the trader simply declines to trade. Extortion
is a paradigmatically quite different kind of deal -- it changes the
transaction from positive-sum to a negative-sum. There is no option for one
party to decline a transaction that the party finds to be too expensive.
