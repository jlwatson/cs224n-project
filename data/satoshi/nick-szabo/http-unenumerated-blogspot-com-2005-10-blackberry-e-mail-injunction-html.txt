Chief Justice Roberts has denied RIM's request to stay an injunction by the
trial court that might soon shut down RIM's Blackberry e-mail system, which
has been held to violate NTP's United States wireless e-mail patent. The
Supreme Court is still considering RIM's petition for writ of certiorari (i.e.
whether to take the case on appeal). The Federal Circuit held that RIM's
distributed system in North America, with a relay server located in Canada and
some of the Blackberries and their users located in the United States,
violated NTP's United States patent for a distributed e-mail system involving
wireless devices and a relay.
