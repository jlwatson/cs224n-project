The registry rewriting problem could have bee prevented by distributing
control over the registry, as in secure property titles. This is also probably
a good idea for keeping track of carbon dioxide rights between countries that
don't trust each other, and might even in the future be at war. We should also
distribute control over carbon dioxide monitoring, so that countries can
monitor each other. Call it a "smart treaty."  
  
I agree that low transaction costs are more important than fairness for
initial allocation. Politicians and lawyers could argue forever over what is
fair, by which time we will have squandered substantial sums while carbon
dioxide keeps climbing. I'm concerned that many people won't realize this and
I'm afraid we will see many stupid and bitter debates over the fairness.
