DN: "a smaller language enables the community of its speakers to build an
exclusive network of trust relationships reinforced by the common language."  
  
I agree and add that the smaller the group, the more stable and reliable the
trust relationships will be. National languages create an _illusion_ that we
all belong to one big tribe, but the number of people whom we can get to know
well enough to actually know their reliability sufficiently is still small
(cf. Dunbar number). The national language thus works primarily for overcoming
the initial barrier of distrust and facilitates the communication of
information about reliability, but other trust-building mechanisms have to
kick in else the illusion degrades. Also, the illusion of trustworthiness is
an unstable situation that can give rise to kleptoparasites, e.g. fraud
artists, who take advantage of the artifically high level of initial trust.  
  
People who speak multiple languages can arbitrage between different trust
networks which would otherwise be mutually exclusive.  
  
National languages I believe helped give rise to the possibility of creating
specialized officers' corps, managers, and bureaucracies by overcoming the
initial hurdle of distrust and allowing for much greater sharing of knowledge
and experience. This catalyzed other institutional breakthroughs that led in
the first instance to Europe's conquest of world trade and later to the
industrial revolution.
