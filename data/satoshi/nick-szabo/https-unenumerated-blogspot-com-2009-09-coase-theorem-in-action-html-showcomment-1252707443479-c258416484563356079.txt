BTW, one consequence of the broad definition is that the supposedly profound
insight about the importance of transaction costs turns into "bad things that
can happen to economic transactions are important to the economy", which does
not sound very profound to me (in patent-lingo it would be called "obvious").
I do observe that too many politicians and even academics ignore such obvious
points, but that is a problem of rhetoric or education, not of theory.  
  
Using confusing language does not help in this educational task. The reality
distortion occurs when economists, because "transaction costs" traditionally
means something far narrower and very different than many other kinds of "bad
things", take the bad things that can happen to transactions to be like
broker's fees that can be reduced through better information and the like. The
most important bad things that can happen to transactions, namely the coercive
ones, may not be amenable to such solutions or may be amenable to them applied
in radically different ways (and note that economic theories of asymmetric
information, transactions in which information reduces transaction costs, are
as usual assuming voluntary transactions and can't be readily used in the
coercive case).
