Alexander, I hadn't quite realized just how far from reality they had traveled
down their imaginary rabbit hole. I hope in the future I'll be finding more
constructive things to do then trying to engage them. Still, I applaud you for
your research of them and hopefully the result will be saving some people from
such mind-wasting drivel.
