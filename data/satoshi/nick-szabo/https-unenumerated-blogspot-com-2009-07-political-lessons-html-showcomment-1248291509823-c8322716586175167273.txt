nazgulnarsil, the Venetian republic was very successful and stable for over
900 years. Here are some ideas for better republics.  
  
In addition to ideas discussed at above-linked articles, another to consider
is physically separating different branches of government in different parts
of the country, sufficiently that they don't belong to the same social
networks. Indeed, they could be forbidden from meeting face-to-face while with
members of another branch in office. Also consider forbidding representatives
to leave their districts while in office -- they debate and vote remotely.  
  
Also, requiring 2/3 votes to raise taxes is a very good idea.  
  
The District of Columbia should consist of 50 small towns, one per state, so
that bureaucrats also don't form such a coherent public-servants vs. selfish
private citizens attitude. It should still be federal territory not under the
jurisdiction of the state.  
  
Of the ideas I discuss in above-linked posts, some of my favorites are:  
  
* Give federal courts jurisdiction over state constitutional issues, and the court of a distant Commonwealth country (New Zealand would be good) jurisdiction over federal constitutional issues. This lessens incentives of courts to increase the powers of said governments, since they aren't part of them.   
  
* Combine unpredictable elections with short terms of office (Venice did this).
