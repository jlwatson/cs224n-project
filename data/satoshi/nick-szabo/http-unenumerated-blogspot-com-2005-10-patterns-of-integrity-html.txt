One of my main interests is the history of institutions, and in particular the
patterns that recur in successful institutions. These organizational
structures and security mechanisms allow naturally suspicious strangers to
interact with integrity.  
  
These patterns include tamper evidence, shared time, unforgeable costliness,
separation of duties, the principle of least authority, risk sharing, and
learning from our ancestors, among many others. These patterns have been
useful for centuries, and (I can report after having spent many years working
in the computer network security field) continue to be useful in the Internet
era.
