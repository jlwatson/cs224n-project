Not only did states print their own money, but so did private banks. Even
Joseph Smith, the Mormon founder, got in on the act. This was also done
(rather better) in England, Scotland, and Ireland. There private note issue
preceded by many decades central bank note issue, and was very common from the
18th to the middle of the 19th century (coincidentally or not, the beginnings
and height in Britain of the industrial revolution).  
  
I don't know of a single good reference on monetary history. The best may be
_The History of Money_ by Glyn Davies. It does a good job with British
monetary history, but is so-so on the rest of Europe and the U.S. It also
gives short shrift to the history of private bank note issue and the debate
between free banking and central banking. This is better covered by The
Rationale of Central Banking and the Free Banking Alternative by Vera Smith.
