A group of U.S.-based professionals who often communicate overseas has sued
the U.S. National Security Agency, observing that their professional
communications and other free speech have been chilled by illegal NSA
surveillance and that their Fourth Amendment rights to speak privately with
clients, sources, and so on have been violated. Here is their complaint to the
U.S. federal court. The plaintiffs say they "have a well-founded belief that
their communications are being intercepted" by the NSA's illegal surveillance
of domestic-overseas communications. The NSA's program is "is disrupting the
ability of the plaintiffs to talk with sources, locate witnesses, conduct
scholarship, and engage in advocacy," and thus the NSA is "seriously
compromising the free speech and privacy rights of the plaintiffs and others"
in violation of the First and Fourth Amendments and the separation of powers.
I have explained why the NSA domestic-overseas surveillance program violates
the Fourth Amendment and separation of powers here. I look forward to reading
the plaintiffs' arguments for their free speech and association claims.  
  
The lead plaintiff is the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Among the
plaintiffs is James Bamford, author of _The Puzzle Palace_ and _Body of
Secrets_ , perhaps the best books written about the NSA. It will be
interesting to see U.S. discovery rules (among the most intrusive in the
world) pitted against U.S. national security secrecy rules (among the most
paranoid in the world).  
  
The complaint has some spelling errors and typos, suggesting that it was
rather quickly thrown together. Here are the plaintiffs' Causes of Action and
Prayer for Relief:  
  

> CAUSES OF ACTION  
>  
> 192\. The Program violates plaintiffs’ free speech and associational rights
guaranteed by the First Amendment.  
>  
> 193\. The Program violates plaintiffs’ privacy rights guaranteed by the
Fourth Amendment.  
>  
> 194\. The Program violates the principle of separation of powers because it
was authorized by President Bush in excess of his Executive authority under
Article II of the United States Constitution and is contrary to limits imposed
by Congress.  
>  
> 195\. The Program violates the Administrative Procedures Act because the
NSA’s actions under the Program exceed statutory authority and limitations
imposed by Congress through FISA and Title III; are not otherwise in
accordance with law; are contrary to constitutional right; and are taken
without observance of procedures required by law.  
>  
> PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
>  
> WHEREFORE plaintiffs respectfully requests[sic] that the Court:  
> 1\. Declare that the Program is unconstitutional under the First and Fourth
Amendments;  
>  
> 2\. Declare that the Program violates the principle of separation of powers;  
>  
> 2.[sic] Declare that the Program violates the Administrative Procedures Act;  
>  
> 3\. Permanently enjoin defendants from utilizing the Program;  
>  
> 4\. Award Plaintiff fees and costs pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412;  
>  
> 5\. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
