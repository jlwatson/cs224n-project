It's relevant, since Locke was a major influence on the Founders, but one
can't mention everything in a blog post. :-) As it happens, I quote the
passage to which you are probably referring (Second Treatise XI:141) on pg. 15
of my paper:  
  
"The legislative power cannot transfer the power of making laws to any other
hands; for it being but a delegated power from the people, they who have it
cannot pass it over to others…nor can the people be bound by any laws but such
as are enacted by those whom they have chosen and authorized to make laws for
them…the legislative neither must nor can transfer the power of making laws to
anybody else, or place it anywhere but where the people have.”
