When you call Cingular customer service, the customer representative you talk
to learns your value to the company via this handy meter. You may or may not
be eligible for various discount offers, depending on how much business you've
done with the company in the past (life time value) and whether they expect
you to stay with them in the future (churn potential). Churn potential is
perhaps based on how hard it would be for you to switch to a competitor. Many
companies track data related to these two variables, but this widget distills
it all down for the operator you talk to.
