On the subject of substitutability, more comments I made elsewhere:  
  
 _The problem [with substitutes like coal gasification, tar sands, etc.] is
that higher inflation expectations must be built into cost estimates for them.
It's no good to say that coal gasification cost only $80/barrel last year, for
example, and so it must be cheaper than oil at $140/barrel. One has to figure
out how much a coal gasification plant will cost over its future lifetime
given the higher expected inflation. The cost ratio for coal gasification or
extracting tar sands to the cost of extracting Saudi oil hasn't changed, it is
still more than a factor of 10 higher. As inflation spreads from gold and oil
(where it appears first) to other commodities, and then to wholesale prices,
then to retail prices, then to labor costs, we will see the nominal costs of
tar sands, coal gasification, nuclear power, wind power, and so on catch up to
the nominal price of oil. The relative real costs of all these sources haven't
changed much, and won't change much, unless there is some joker discovery like
a great improvement to biofuels due to genetic engineering. (It is true that
the nominal attractiveness of these alternatives to oil increases the R &D
into alternatives and thus increases odds of such a joker occuring per year).
Nevertheless, it's probably the case that only nominal relative costs, rather
than real relative costs, have and will substantially change due to inflation
expectations hitting gold and oil prices before they hit other kinds of
prices._
