Unenumerated is going into reruns season. For the next few weeks I will be
reposting the best articles from this blog. These will mostly be posts from
previous years, so unless you have been a reader since the beginning or have
read most of the archives many of these will be new to you.  
  
Most blogs discuss the news or similar ephemera and for them reruns would be
silly, but this blog mostly discusses issues of historical or otherwise long-
term importance, and I will only be rerunning those kinds of articles. If you
haven't read a particular old article from Unenumerated yet it will be as
informative and entertaining today as when it was first posted.  
  
I will probably have "theme weeks" where this blog will run several classic
articles on a particular theme (jurisdiction, legal/political procedure,
property, contracts, money, traditional security, online security protocols,
media, etc.).
