Mike, you lost me. Corporations do far, far better hiring executives than
voters do "hiring" politicians. But it is rather hard to numerically compare
the performance of a monopoly that can compel its "customers" to hand over
money by force with the performance of a corporation that must seek out
voluntary customers in a competitive market. The fact that the IRS has by far
the highest profit margin of any organization within the U.S. by no means
makes its performance superior.
