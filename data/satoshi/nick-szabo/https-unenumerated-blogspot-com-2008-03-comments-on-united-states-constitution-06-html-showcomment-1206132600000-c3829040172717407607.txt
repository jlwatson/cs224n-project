Thanks, Richard. I am looking for a new platform to blog on. I need to be able
to export my old posts cleanly from blogger to the new platform, I should also
be able to export cleanly from the new platform (I don't want my content held
hostage by a platform), and it should be an advance along the lines Richard
recommends. Dear readers, a bleg, what platform(s) do you recommend?
