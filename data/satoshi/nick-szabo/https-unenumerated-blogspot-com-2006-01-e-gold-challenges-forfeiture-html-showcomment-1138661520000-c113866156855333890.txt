The burden of proof in criminal cases is on the government, Mike. Here they
came nowhere near meeting this burden. That is why I "cast aspersions" on the
fed's handling of this case. My comments are directed at the prosecutors
themselves, and to the politicians and voters who uncritically support them,
not to any potential jury in this case. Every time prosecutors screw up like
this, they do indeed make it easier for real criminals to get away with fraud.
Making this kind of case against an innocent (as far as we can tell from their
complaint) and innovative company reduce the "ethos" of the Justice Department
(see Aristotle). It also reduces American competitiveness, as it encouragers
innovative companies to base themselves overseas.  
  
As for for fraud, the company still has a strong incentive, both for business
reasons and because of other laws they and their customers must follow
involving tax, fraud, etc. not to allow their system to be used for such
things. Protection against fraud does not require grossly disproportionate
seizures without trial for mere alleged failure to figure out, given the
confusing information provided to them by Treasury, what the proper licenses
they need. Vigilance against fraud is worthwhile, and e-gold already has
strong incentives to exercise such vigilance itself, but the irrational fear,
which rather than protection against fraud is what the Justice Department
seems to have an incentive to generate, is very destructive of efforts to
provide innovative solutions to fraud, inflation, and other ills of commerce.
