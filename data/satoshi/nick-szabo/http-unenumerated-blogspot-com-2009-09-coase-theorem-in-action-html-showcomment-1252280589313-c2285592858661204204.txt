Try again. :-)  
  
Nazgulnarsil, I'm in the dark as to how you link "implicit contract" to tort
law. I can only imagine that you might be referring to implied-in-law
contracts. The canonical one is that if you are unconscious and a doctor helps
you, you owe the doctor a reasonable fee.  
  
Implied-in-law contracts are a very narrow exception to the otherwise
universal rule that one must actually form a contract for their to be an
obligation to pay for a service. If a gardener comes uninvited and starts
mowing your lawn, or a windshield wiper comes up to your car on the street and
stars wiping, you don't legally owe them for either their putative or actual
services. (In some jurisdictions if you know they are providing the service
and don't object, a contract can be imputed, but these can be considered cases
of tacit consent). These people who provide services uninvited are called in
many jurisdictions "officious intermeddlers" becausing they are presuming to
know what you want rather than negotiating a contract. (Come to think of it,
"officious intermeddler" is a good description of many government officials as
well).  
  
Even less does somebody committing a tort against another create a contractual
relationship. Your rights, to the extent you have them, to be free from the
noises of strangers is a matter of tort law (the law of nuisance), not of
contract law -- you can't (except for that doctor) have contractual
relationships with complete strangers.
