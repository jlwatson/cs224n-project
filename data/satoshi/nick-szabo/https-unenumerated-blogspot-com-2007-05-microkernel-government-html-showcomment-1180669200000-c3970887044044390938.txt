Mencius,  
  
(1) Adam Smith lived under a system of substantive common law -- property
rights, contract, and so on -- that allowed the market conditions he described
to occur. It's absurd to propose an arbitrary lawmaker _and_ assume such
conditions at the same time. Many other governments, including some owned by
shareholders which Smith criticized, did not have good laws and thereby had
terrible economies.  
  
(2) Dubai is a special case of a trading center that must continually attract
new people -- thus maintain low exit costs. The vast majority of the globe is
quite different -- it is full of fixtures and social networks on which wide-
area monopolies of force impose very high exit costs. You don't impose any
principle to keep governments the size of cities, nor any solution to keep the
main fixtures of the world from being extorted.  
  
(3) You don't address the central role of legal procedure and that its rules
and incentives are profoundly different from those of the market: see my new
post here.  
  
Thanks for the spelling recommendation -- I'm coming to agree with that.
