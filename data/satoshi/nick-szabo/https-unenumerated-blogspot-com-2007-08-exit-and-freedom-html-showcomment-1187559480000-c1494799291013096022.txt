DN: "What recourse do I have, if my business partner (whom I have formally
invited) is denied entry and it damages my business? Can I sue the person
making this decision?"  
  
I cannot yet give legal advice, sorry (and once I can you'll have to pay, you
won't get it here. :-)  
  
If your question is about what the law _should_ be, I'd say that a person
unjustifiably restrained from crossing a border should be able to sue for
false imprisonment, just as if they were unjustifiably restrained from walking
from A to B inside a jurisdiction. But what might constitute a justification
for such restraint is left as an exercise for the student. :-)
