nazgulnarsil, that is essentially what my proposal is (albeit made well before
Bitcoin ;-)  
  
Anonymous (please choose a handle, thanks): no, thanks for the recommendation.  
  
stochastix, the name "scholastic" is meant to refer to the methods medeival
scholars, not modern ones. The medeival method in turn derived from the
practive of legal debate. A better name would be "dialectic" except that Hegel
and Marx ruined that perfectly good term. Tying it to a particular quantum
interpretation would be false precision. :-) I'm simply using quantum
mechanical superposition as a metaphor audiences with a modicum of modern
physics knowledge audiences can understand, that's all. Alas the name does
come with the unfortunate associations you mention. Perhaps "superpositional"
will do.
