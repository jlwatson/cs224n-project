The most credible justification for NASA is to create "public goods" -- things
that private companies would tend to create much less of because they could
not recoup much of the value in the form of revenues and profits.  
  
By this view the most valuable part of NASA is that part that which produces
science and engineering data that have widespread benefits in the aerospace
industry, as well science that adds to our understanding of the earth's
environment and basic theory.  
  
Examples of things that are not public goods but that NASA is often tempted to
engage in: trying to prematurely establish an industry by subsidizing it
(because the shape of the future is best discovered by competitive
experimention rather than planning)and things mainly done to glorify the
government itself, as described in my article.
