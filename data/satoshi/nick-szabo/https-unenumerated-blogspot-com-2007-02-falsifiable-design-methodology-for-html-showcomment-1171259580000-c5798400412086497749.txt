"...a group fund... targeted at purchasing those companies would decrease the
price (because of fewer competitive offers) and hopefully free up more capital
for acquisitions lower down the ladder (an advantage for entrepreneurs in
general)."  
  
That sounds like a good economic argument, although legally one might have to
worry about anti-trust issues.  
  
Even if the acquirers don't care about current revenue they do care greatly
about revenue potential, e.g. eyeballs. In these kinds of startups the biggest
uncertainties are usually social factors, like how many people one can draw to
participate in and help build the community. An even more unpredictable "art"
than chemistry (to tie it into my post, as I didn't see how you were doing
that :-)
