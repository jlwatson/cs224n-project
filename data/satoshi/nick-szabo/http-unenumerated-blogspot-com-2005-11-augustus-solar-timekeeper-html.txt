The University of Oregon is recreating a famous Roman sundial from 10 B.C.
which doubled as a clock and calendar. A few decades earlier the Roman comic
writer Plautus put into the mouth of an idle character a complaint against
shared standards of time and scheduling:  
  
“The gods confound the man who first found out  
  
How to distinguish the hours. Confound him too,  
  
Who in this place set up a sundial,  
  
To cut and hack my days so wretchedly  
  
Into small pieces! When I was a boy,  
  
My belly was my sundial – only surer,  
  
Truer, and more exact than any of them.  
  
This dial told me when ‘twas the proper time  
  
To go to dinner, when I ought to eat;  
  
But nowadays, why even when I have,  
  
I can’t fall to unless the sun gives leave.  
  
The town’s so full of these confounded dials!”  
  
  
As I described my article "A Measure of Sacrifice,"  the Romans recognized
astronomical time as a measure of sacrifice, but it was the medieval bell and
clock makers who gave us our modern sense of precise shared time. Precise and
objectively measured time used as measure of sacrifice is one of the patterns
of integrity basic to modern civilization. I describe some of the latest
research in securely sharing time and determining the order of events on the
Internet in "Advances in Distributed Security."
