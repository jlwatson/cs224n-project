A useful metaphor, BTW, is Liebig's barrel:

That said, Liebig's law of the minimum, while a great rule of thumb, is not
always and entirely true. To a limited degree organisms can proximately adapt,
and to a much greater but still limited (per my last comment) degree can
ultimately adapt (i.e. evolve), by taking special steps to conserve the scarce
nutrient and by substituting one nutrient for another. Thus, for example,
being a bit low on water, nitrogen, phosphorous, or carbon can stunt the
growth of a plant but it will often take some steps to conserve the scarce
nutrient and thus reproduce. If you are on a low-fat diet you will end up
making up for it by eating more carbs, and vice versa.  
  
As a result, it's not strictly the case that there is always just nutrient
needed by an organism such that it never needs anything else until it is
satiated on that one. It's just close to being the case, and a good rule of
thumb that a balanced diet, with the staves of Liebig's barrel built up to the
same level, is better than an unbalanced one.  
  
And our human economy with its knowledge and technology is far better still at
substitution, which I hope to discuss in future posts.
