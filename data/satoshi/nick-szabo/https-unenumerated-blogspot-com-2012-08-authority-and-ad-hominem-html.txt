Argument from authority ("I'm the expert") goes hand-in-hand with the _ad
hominem_ ("you're not"). Each may be rebutted by the other, and the average
quality as evidence of arguments from authority are about the same as the
average quality as evidence of _ad hominem_. By necessity, these two kinds of
evidence are the dominant forms of evidence that lead each of us as
individuals to believe what we believe, since little important of what you
believe comes from your own direct observation. Authority's investment costs
are one good proxy measure for evaluating the value of such evidence. But
contrast the law of the dominant paradigm. Perhaps the latter is superior for
judging claims about the objective world, whereas investment costs are
superior for judging the intersubjective.
