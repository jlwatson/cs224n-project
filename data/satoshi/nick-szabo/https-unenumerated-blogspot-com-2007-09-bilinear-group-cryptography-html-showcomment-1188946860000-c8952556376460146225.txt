jojo: One basic difference is that when the proxy transforms Alice's signature
into Bob's, the proxy does not have to be Bob. Another is that the setup
requires cooperation between Alice, Bob, and the proxy during key generation,
so that (depending on what out-of-band semantics is imputed to the signature)
one can impute some kind of authorization or consent by the parties to the re-
signing.
