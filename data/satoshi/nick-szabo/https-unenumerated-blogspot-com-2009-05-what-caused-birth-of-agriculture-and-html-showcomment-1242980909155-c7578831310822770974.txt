 _the geographical claim that Europe has the "critical mass" but also that the
individual countries are more able to be easily defensible_ It's true that
some geographies are, assuming something the size of a nation-state with a
reasonable navy, cheaper to secure than others (e.g. Britain or Ireland than
Western Europe, Japan or Taiwan than China), but I don't see how it
distinguishes Europe from East Asia. There are plenty of geographically
defensible areas in East Asia: the Korean Penninsula, Japan, Taiwan, the
Phillipines, the Malay Penninsula, Indonesia, etc. Any of these could have
played the role of tiny Portugal in conquering the world's trade routes if
they'd had the appropriate culture. Why did Portugal capture Malacca instead
of the Malaysians or Japanese or any other East or South Asian peoples
capturing Gibraltar? Explain that, and we've probably also explained quite a
bit about why the IR occurred in Western Europe rather than in East Asia.  
  
We could think of Western Europe as something of a penninsula pinched a bit by
the Adriatic and the Baltic, but with a brief and only loosely united
exception (the Holy Roman Empire for a couple of centuries) this stretch was
never defended by a single polity. Security-wise there's no difference between
warring with each other, which European dukedoms, city-states, kingdoms, and
nation-states did aplenty, and warring with invaders from the Russian steppes
or Turkey, or our hypothetical invaders from East or South Asia via the route
around the south tip of Africa which never came.
