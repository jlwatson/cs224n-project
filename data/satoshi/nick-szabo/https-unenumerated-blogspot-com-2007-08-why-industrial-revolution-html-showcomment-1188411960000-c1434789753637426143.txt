It's _genetic_ evolution that doesn't work that fast. I quite agree that
memetic evolution can work that fast, which is why I think it must be almost
entirely cultural rather than genetic evolution that explains these large
changes over the last 500 years including both Western Europe's colonization
of the planet and the industrial revolution.  
  
 _In England's case, I think they created cultural institutions that worked
well, and exported them to places that could use them more effectively._  
  
I think to some extent this is true. It is certainly true in the broader sense
that Western Europe developed book consciousness (which includes raising most
children to be literate, teaching knowledge and even some skills primarily
through books rather that orally, national languages, science, large
organizations, and a number of other aspects of "modernity" all stemming from
the rise of a market in cheap books from a a diverse and competitive industry
of printers) and then exported it to most of the rest of the world.
