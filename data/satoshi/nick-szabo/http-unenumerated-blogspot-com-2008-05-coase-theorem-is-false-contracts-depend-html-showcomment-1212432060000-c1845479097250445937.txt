clayton: _let's consider region A where extortive bargaining is common and
region B where mutually beneficial bargaining (voluntary transactions) is
common. Over time, we expect region B to operate much more efficiently than
region A._  
  
First of all, without good tort law region B won't exist, because there will
be many opportunities for cheap coercion and thus high incentives for
extortion. But if one fine day we have drastic divine intervention (perhaps
the Simulators get bored) and region B miraculously springs into existence,
its utopia will soon go extinct after immigration of mobsters or tax
collectors from region A who set up profitable extortion rackets in region B.
Nothing close to efficient outcomes happens unless there is good tort law, and
probably some criminal law as well, preventing coercive bargaining.
