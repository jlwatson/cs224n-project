I should also point out that a few northern Italian cities of that time, in
particular Genoa, Florence, and Venice, thanks to recent innovations like
insurance and double-entry bookeeping, were far more advanced than the rest of
the world in business culture generally. These also were part of the
background that made possible both the super-companies and (when these
innovations spread north) the vastly larger colonial and later industrial
corporations.
