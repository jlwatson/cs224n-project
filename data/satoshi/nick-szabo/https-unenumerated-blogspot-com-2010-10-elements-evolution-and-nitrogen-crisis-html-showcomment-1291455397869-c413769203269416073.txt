I haven't looked specifically the numbers on how much the overall biomass and
number of cells increased, so I don't know how significant phosphorous
recycled from ancestors was, or the small amount of residual phosphorous
contaminating "arsenate only" nutrient solution. Presumably, however, the fact
that the zero-arsenate-and-zero-phosphate solution brought growth to a halt
controls for the recycling and residual contamination. These kinds of things
will have to be checked by independent scientists repeating the experiment.  
  
If the experiment had a flaw in its controls, as argued by skeptic Steven
Benner, it's possible the organism adapts by just using far less phosphate and
by isolating the arsenic in the large vacuoles that appeared when fed only
arsenate. The As:P ratio changed over the course of the experiment from 1:500
to 7:1. This might just reflect a vast amount of arsenate segregated in the
vacuoles.  
  
However, some arsenic was also detected by spectroscopy of teh resulting DNA.
And I tend to agree the difference between the arsenate-only growth of 60% and
the no-phosphate/no-arsentate growth of zero strongly suggests the arsenate is
being used functionally in place of phosphate. Just that the evidence is
indirect and of course needs to be independently repeated, and we can't yet
conclude which specific molecules were involved.  
  
Phosphorous is about a thousand times more abundant than arsenic in the
universe, strongly suggesting that P(A or B) is only very slightly higher than
P(A).
