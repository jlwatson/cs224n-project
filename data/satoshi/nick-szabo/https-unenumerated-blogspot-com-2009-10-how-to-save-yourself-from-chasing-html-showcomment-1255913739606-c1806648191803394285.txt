George, if like Nick Bostrom and Robin Hanson you infer things from astronomy
and the Drake Equation that we can get a far better estimate of by observing
ourselves, then you want life to be very rare. Because if it is as common as
the astrobiologists claim, then there must be a "Great Filter" that brings a
stop to evolution about 99.99999999999999999% of the time somewhere between
primitive life and building big artifacts like Dyson Spheres that we should be
observing in place of unshaded stars and galaxies but don't. Given yet another
splendid assumption about distribution functions in the face of ignorance (no
such thing as "distribution function unknown" here), a significant fraction of
that Great Filter probably still lies ahead of us, so that there is a
99.9999999% chance of humanity being wiped out sometime between now and
permanent space colonization. Which means that our already pitifully brief
lifespans will likely be cut further short by some imminent disaster. In other
words, if we find primitive life on Europa, prepare to die. (Don't quote me on
the decimal places, I just kept the 9 key pressed down until I figured it was
reasonably representative of their argument).
