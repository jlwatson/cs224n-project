A couple years ago I wrote this piece which links to a number of cases in
which the United States Supreme Court has protected important rights of
relationship. Post-New Deal courts often make a phony distinction between
"economic" relationships (which post-New Deal U.S. courts do not generally
deem worthy of protection, despite many expressed and implied clauses in the
U.S. Constitution to the contrary) and political and personal relationships,
which are often and quite properly well-protected. An unprejudiced reading of
the United States Constitution indicates that it was intended to strongly
protect economic relationships as well as political and personal ones.  
  
Personal and political relationships are not strongly protected unless related
economic relationships are strongly protected. (Thus, for example, the right
to use contraceptives under _Griswold_ is phony if it does not include the
right make contracts regarding contraceptives, for example the right of a
drugstore to sell and a consumer to buy condoms). Furthermore, many
relationships and statuses labeled "economic" have strong personal aspects.
For example, owning and living in a house usually includes important personal
memories, privacy interests, and community ties. I will discuss this topic
more in the future.
