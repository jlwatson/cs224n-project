Much of this is political inertia. We are still largely dominated by political
ideas developed when agriculture was the dominant form of property. When a
country industrializes first (more goods-dominated) you get more republican
institutions, which borrow heavily from the medieval city republics (also
goods dominated). When it goes straight from agriculture to oil, like Saudi
Arabia or Venezuala, you don't have much chance for republican institutions to
develop.
