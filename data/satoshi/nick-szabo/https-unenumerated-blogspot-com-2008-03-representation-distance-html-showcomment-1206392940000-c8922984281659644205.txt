Broadly speaking, I'd say that's right. In the sense that one might loosely
speak of a debtor as an agent and a creditor as a principal. The only
"interest" involved is a very simple one, though, paying back a specific debt,
so this is a somewhat loose analogy, not at the core of the meaning of
"agency."  
  
Representation distance creates selectional bias (lack of information,
bribery, catering only to majorities or other subsets, etc. during the process
of selecting the agent(s)) and operational bias (same kinds of biases and
conflicts of interest but while acting as agent(s)).  
  
Adverse selection is a well known subset of selection bias studied by
economists, and moral hazard is a well known subset of operational bias.  
  
In the case of credit, transferring credit risk is a form of insurance, and
creates moral hazard. There are also related adverse selection problems. These
tend to be well known among economists, albeit not well enough known enough to
include them properly in most of the models Wall Street has been using.
