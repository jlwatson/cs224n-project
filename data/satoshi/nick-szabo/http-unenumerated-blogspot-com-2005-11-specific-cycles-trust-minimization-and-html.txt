While responding to Ian Grigg's comment to my previous blog entry on _kula_ ,
I came up with what is the most rigorous explanation for the two-collectible
cycle that I've seen. The explanation neatly incorporates two patterns I've
talked about in the past, namely (1) the literal circulation of collectibles
in specific cycles to minimize non-coincidence transaction costs in a
bilateral monopoly economy, and (2) trust minimization in institution design.
