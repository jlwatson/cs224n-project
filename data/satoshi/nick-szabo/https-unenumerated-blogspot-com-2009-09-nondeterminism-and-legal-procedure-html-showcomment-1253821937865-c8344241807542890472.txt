nazgulnarsil, that's a very good point -- economies of specialization create
(lesser, at equilibrium) transaction costs due to information asymmetry. This
suggests that the more efficient and higher population a civilization is, the
higher its transaction costs as a proportion of the the economy. A corollary
is that social nondeterminism increases with the higher division of labor of a
more advanced economy -- we become more mutually unpredictable. Very
interesting.  
  
It's worthwhile thinking then about why division of labor is valuable. If it's
valuable for taming the nondeterminism of nature (for example the vast
complexity of the human body in order to improve our health), then one can
speculate that we will reach a point in the future when any further gains
against nature from division of labor will be offset by increased transaction
costs, and division of labor have reached a natural maximum.  
  
Of course, this might already have occurred in some industries -- perhaps in
some service industries, for example, where value is primarily social rather
than material.
