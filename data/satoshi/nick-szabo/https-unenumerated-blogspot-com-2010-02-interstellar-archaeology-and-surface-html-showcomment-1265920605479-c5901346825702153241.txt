Energy is conserved, so they have to radiate any energy they are using, just
at lower frequencies such as infrared. Since there is no such thing as a
perfect black body, differences between different "gray body" radiators (e.g.
between natural carbon-rich dust clouds and artificial radiators) will show up
on the infrared spectra.
