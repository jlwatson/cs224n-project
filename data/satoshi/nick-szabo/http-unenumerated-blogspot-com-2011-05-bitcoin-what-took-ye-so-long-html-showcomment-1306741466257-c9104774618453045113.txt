 _If the standardized value is inversely proportional to the number of puzzles
solved during a week,_  
  
I don't think this will happen. The market will set the relative value of a
solution bit from one week to a solution bit from another week based on what
people believe the relative cost of solving a bit was between those weeks. If
the value of the standard bundle falls causing some miners to drop out, the
profit margin of the remaining miners remains as it was after the value fell
but before the miners dropped out.  
  
Weeks when the standard bundle goes down there may be very little production
(with that week counting for very little in the standard bundle) whereas weeks
where the standard bundle goes up there will be abnormally large production
and a correspondingly high number of solution bits from that week incorporated
into the standard bundle. A very interesting issue though!
