Here's a comment I made to people responding to (at least a lossy summary of)
this post on Less Wrong:  
  
The asteroid threat is a good example of a low-probability disaster that is
probably not a Pascal scam. On point (1) it is fairly lottery-like, insofar as
asteroid orbits are relatively predictable -- the unknowns are primarily
"known unknowns", being deviations from very simple functions -- so it's
possible to compute odds from actual data, rather than merely guessing them
from a morass of "unknown unknowns". It passes test (2) as we have good ways
to simulate with reasonable accuracy and (at some expense, only if needed)
actually test solutions. And best of all it passes test (3) -- experiments or
observations can be done to improve our information about those odds. Most of
the funding has, quite properly, gone to those empirical observations, not
towards speculating about solutions before the problem has been well
characterized.  
  
Alas, most alleged futuristic threats and hopes don't fall into such a clean
category: the evidence is hopelessly equivocal (even if declared with a false
certainty) or missing, and those advocating that our attention and other
resources be devoted to them usually fail to propose experiments or
observations that would imrove that evidence and thus reduce our uncertainty
to levels that would distinguish them from the near-infinity of plausible
disaster scenarios we could imagine. (Even with just the robot apocalypse,
there are a near-infinity of ways one can plausibly imagine it playing out).
