  
We have seen that U.S. Rep. David Crockett, later a hero of the Alamo, argued
passionately against the propriety and constitutionality of federal charity.
Crockett told his fellow Representatives that taxpayer money was "not yours to
give."  
  
During the first several decades after the U.S. Constitution was enacted,
constitutional issues were debated and decided far more often in Congress than
in the Supreme Court. Crockett was part of a long line of early and eminent
Congressional constitutionalists who argued against the constitutionality of
federal charity. Another was James Madison, one of the main drafters of the
Constitution as well as one of its main proponents in the Federalist Papers.
Opposing moderate Federalists and Republicans were were radical Federalists
who argued following Alexander Hamilton for practically unlimited federal
powers. According to Crockett, Madison, and many others, Congress had no power
under any clause of the Constitution to allocate money for charity, except
when such charity was necessary and proper (using a fairly narrow construction
of that phrase) for implementing an enumerated Congressional power such as
funding and governing the armed forces, paying federal debts, executing the
laws, or implementing treaties.  
  
David P. Currie's book _The Constitution in Congress_ chronicles these early
constitutional debates and is a must read for constitutional scholars. It
contains debates by many House members (including James Madison, Elbridge
Gerry, and other founders and drafters) on the constitutionality of many
different kinds of legislation. Currie cites the Annals of the early Congress
which are now online.  Currie discussses the following two debates on federal
charity:  
  
 **(1)** In 1793, a number of French citizens were driven out of the French
Colony of Hispaniola (now Haiti), landed in Baltimore, and petitioned Congress
for financial assistance. Rep. John Nicholas expressed doubt that Congress had
the constitutional authority "to bestow the money of their constituents on an
act of charity."[1] Rep. Abraham Clark responded that "in a case of this kind,
we are not to be tied up by the Constitution." [2]. Rep. Elias Boudinot,
another radical Federalist, argued that the general welfare clause authorized
this kind of spending.[3] Rep. James Madison resolved the debate by observing
that the U.S. owed France money from the Revolutionary War. Madison disagreed
with the radical Federalist interpretation of the general welfare clause and
argued against setting a dangerous precedent for open-ended spending. Congress
could, however, provide money to the French refugees in partial payment of
these debts, and thus constitutionally under Congress' Article I powers to pay
federal debts.[4]  
  
 **(2)** The second opportunity to debate the constitutionality of federal
charity occurred when a fire destroyed much of the previously thriving city of
Savannah, Georgia in 1796. The fire was referred to as a "national calamity."
Rep. John Milledge related how "[n]ot a public building, not a place of public
worship, or of public justice" was left standing. Rep. Willaim Claiborne again
raised the radical Federalist argument that the measure to help fund the
rebuilding of Savannah was constitutional under the general welfare clause.[5]
Reps. Nathaniel Macon[6], William Giles[7], Nicholas[8], and others argued
that allocating federal funds to relieve Savannah would violate the
Constitution, since such charity was not authorized by any enumerated power in
the Constitution. "Insurance offices," not the federal government, were "the
proper securities against fire," according to Macon.[8] Rep. Andrew Moore
argued "every individual citizen could, if he pleased, show his individual
humanity by subscribing to their relief, but it was not Constitutional for
them to afford relief from the Treasury."[9] The measure to provide relief to
Savannah from federal tax dollars was then defeated 55-24 [10].
