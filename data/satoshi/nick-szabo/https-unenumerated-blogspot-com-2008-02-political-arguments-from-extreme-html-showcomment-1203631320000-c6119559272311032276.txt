Peter, that's a very good point, and indeed I'd expect the necessity defense
to be the main reason given by prosecutor or jury in exercising their
discretion. While the examples given by torture proponents usually satisfy the
necessity defense, in fact they want open-ended allowance of torture that goes
far beyond any such defense.
