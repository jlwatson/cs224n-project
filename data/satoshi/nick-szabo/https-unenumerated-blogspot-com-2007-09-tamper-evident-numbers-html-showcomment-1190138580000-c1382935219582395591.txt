That's an interesting article. One point of variance -- tallies were in use
long before the Norman invasion, and probably date from very prehistoric
times. For example, some notched bones from before 10,000 BC have been found
that are probably tallies. Particuarly interesting for tallies, which may be
of more recent invention than prehistoric times, is the splitting protocol
(each side gets half of the tally stick split lengthwise).
