Howie, you're talking about a blog post, not a research paper. If you don't
already know, it's easy to discover that Reisman's premise of rising
regulatory costs is quite true. There are plenty of materials on the Internet
showing how much regulations costs business and how much this has changed over
the last few decades (and thus, via Reisman's straightforward argument,
depress wages). See for example this government regulatory cost report.
