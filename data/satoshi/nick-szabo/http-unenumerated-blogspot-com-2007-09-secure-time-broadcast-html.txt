From my article Advances in Distributed Security:  

> Broadcasts using sound or radiation, from sources such as bell towers, radio
towers, satellites, and pulsars, must send out the same value to every
receiver. A remote beacon such as a pulsar has perfect security: the access
structure is any party, and its complement, the attack structure, is the empty
set. For human controlled broadcasts, the attack structure consists only of
the broadcaster and the access structure is any receiver.  
>  
> Natural broadcasts are thus immune to the problem, described in the
discussion of the Byzantine Generals problem below, of a transmitter sending
different values to different receivers. Indeed, as we will see below,
distributed researchers have gone to great lengths just to recreate this
simple property on the Internet with logical broadcast protocols.  
>  
> Nature provides clocks that are oblivious to the malicious intentions of any
outside parties. In the case of a remote high-energy system such as a pulsar,
this means anybody. Pulsars are many orders of magnitude more accurate than
random delays that face attackers on the Internet. If critical Internet
servers were synchronized to natural clocks in a secure and timely fashion,
they would be immune to attacks that relied on uncertainties in timing.

Detecting pulsars is still, alas, a difficult process, but not so hard that
amateurs have had no success doing so. Amateurs have had some success tracking
pulsars with software defined radio and quagi antennas combined with digital
signal processing.
