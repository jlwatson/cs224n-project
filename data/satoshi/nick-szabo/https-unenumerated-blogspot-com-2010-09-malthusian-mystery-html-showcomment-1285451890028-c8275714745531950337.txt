Oops "northwest" should be "northeast" above, i.e. rightwards and upwards.  
  
BTW, another illuminating fact to know is that hunter-gatherers, because of
their higher food production labor productivity, spent more time than pre-
British-revolution agriculture  
doing things besides food production. But even hunter-gatherers spent a far
higher fraction of their activity on food production than we in the developed
world do. The Malthusian trap made large populations engaged in work other
than food production impossible until the Brits (with plenty learned from the
Dutch and others) figured out how to escape from the trap.
