Brian, that's a great observation. I suspect introduction of the horse made
things even worse (because they provided further advantage to roving bandits
against stationary bandits and farmers) until farmers started setting up
fences and enforcing property rights with guns and states.  
  
George, I have indeed only scratched the surface. I suspect micro-democracies
can be explained partially by military technology and organization (phalanx
and long spears for the Greeks, militias or posses and guns for the America
frontier) and partially by shared cultural heritage (English and Americans
purposefully tried to revive classical and medieval republican ideas as well
as home-grown democratic institutions such as juries and town hall meetings).  
  
I also suspect that law takes a very long time to adapt to an optimal tradeoff
of economic efficiency and security (often centuries), and takes longer to
adapt the larger and more complicated the state. Furthermore, I think this
adaptation may be very sub-optimal in a larger jurisdiction, such as the
ancient Roman Empire or China, probably for the reasons of your final point --
I suspect that public choice problems become worse in larger states. Mancur
Olson argues that public choice problems become worse as a state becomes more
mature, thus for example explaining the long decline of the Roman Empire and
the long stagnancy of the Chinese Empire.  
  
You're right, this is a big topic!
