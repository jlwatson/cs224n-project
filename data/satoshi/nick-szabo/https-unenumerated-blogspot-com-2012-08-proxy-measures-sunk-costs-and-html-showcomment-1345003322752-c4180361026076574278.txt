A bit more formally the above expression should be  
  
relative value of two institutions/investments/decisions =  
f(preferences, evidence against - (weight of evidence for + (discount
factor)*(sunk cost of state of affairs)))  
  
Where evidence maps starting objective states of the world and preferences to
objective outcomes (in other words the evidence tells us what outcomes would
result and how well those would satisfy our preferences).  
  
Of course, one quite likely needs sub-heuristics or further proxy measures to
calculate such a thing -- or to the extent you can't calculate it accurately,
or are unconfident of your hunches, greater reliance on sunk costs as a proxy
measure ef value.
