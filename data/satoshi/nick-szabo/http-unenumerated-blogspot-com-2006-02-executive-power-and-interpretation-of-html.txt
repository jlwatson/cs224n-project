While I'm on the subject of applying software metaphors to legal code, here is
a short article I recently wrote on the principle of least authority.  
  
I go into issues of executive versus legislative power in the U.S. in more
depth in Origins of the Non-Delegation Doctrine, with extensive commentary on
this subject from both Federalists and Anti-Federalists. (As you may recall,
the Federalists were the primary movers behind the original Constitution, and
the anti-Federalists were the primary movers behind the Bill of Rights. The
Constitution was ratified by most states conditional to a Bill of Rights,
which was later pushed through Congress by anti-Federalists and compromising
Federalists such as James Madison).  
  
The paper also discusses further how protection of liberties was the prime
motivation for the mechanisms such as checks and balances in the Constitution.
As Locke said:  
  
"[w]e agree to surrender some of our natural rights so that government can
function to preserve the remainder. Absolute arbitrary power, or governing
without settled standing laws, can neither of them consist with the ends of
society and government, which men would not quit the freedom of the state of
nature for, nor tie themselves up under, were it not to preserve their lives,
liberties, and fortunes; and by stated rules of right and property to secure
their peace and quiet."[1]
