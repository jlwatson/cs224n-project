Over a hundreds years ago, John Stuart Mill had this vision of a world of
school vouchers instead of the government-dictated curriculum that is the
current dominant model of public education. Government-dictated curriculum
features listening and speech compelled by a command-and-control hierarchy.
Control over this curriculum is the source of endless conflict between
irreconcilable opinions. Government-compelled speech and listening flies in
the face of freedom of expression in a marketplace of ideas that is the
hallmark of a free society. Mill proposed an actual marketplace for schools.
The Institute for Justice is leading the legal effort to implement this
marketplace of ideas for parents and their children in the United States.
