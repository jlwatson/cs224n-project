In what ways does your vote count? Should you vote for the candidate you most
agree with or for the least objectionable candidate who can win? I can't put
it any better than this comment by Mark Bahner, which deserves its own blog
post:

election, I **know** it can't, to greater than 99.99+ percent certainty.

them) agree to respond to Nielson TV-watching polls.

gets elected. (This is in contrast to local politics, in which a school bond
in my parents town actually finished with a tie, with some 10,000+ votes
cast.)

presidential candidate who is closest to your political views. If you are a
libertarian, there is only one libertarian running in either party. That's Ron
Paul. Mitt Romney is not even in the same league, stadium, or country as Ron
Paul, as a libertarian. Ron Paul is a libertarian. Mitt Romney is not. And
neither is any other other Democratic and Republican candidate.

The main thing you do with a vote is send a signal to political players about
your views. The second thing you do with a vote is create a power bloc with
which other candidates may have to negotiate and compromise. Very far down on
the list of things your vote might be good for is changing who wins. Only for
this last inconsequential reason to vote is the "they can't win" argument
relevant. If you are not voting for the candidate you most agree with,
regardless of their chances of winning, you truly are throwing away your vote.
