My own opinion is that "from A to B" is a restriction under the Due Process
Clause. This is because this was, along with a number of procedural rights, a
canonical example of something that would violate the Law of the Land Clause
of the Magna Carta, from which the Due Process Clause derives.  
  
But the Takings Clause and the Due Process Clause are all part of the same
sentence in the 5th Amendment, and the Takings Clause applies to the states
via the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, so your interpretation may
be practically as good.
