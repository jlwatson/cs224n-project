Ian Grigg has a good article on the the investigation involving e-gold(tm).
Here is a letter from e-gold's Doug Jackson. Note that e-gold, like e-cash,
PayPal, etc. is a trusted third party payment system, and thus very different
from bit gold. Unlike most payment systems, however, e-gold is its own
currency, fixed to the value of gold.
