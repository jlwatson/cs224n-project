Richard Parker lives in a small Philippine fishing village. He has extensively
studied contemporary seashore foraging, fishing, and bead-making, and has
thought and written quite a bit about prehistoric versions of same. Parker
riffs on my theory of the origins of money, adding many interesting
observations he's made about shells and bead-making along the way. He has some
good comments about the debate over whether the older finds were actually
beads or the puncture holes were just a result of the way they ate snails.
Although he questions the rush of archaeologists to conclude that they were
beads rather than worked prey, he concludes that _Nassarius_ , at least, was
too small for eating. Piercing them and sucking out the contents would
presumably have been more trouble than it was worth.  
  
Archaeologists recently discovered similar punctured _Nassarius_ shells in
Algeria and Israel that date back to 90,000 to 100,000 or more B.P.
