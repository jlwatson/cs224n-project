Alas, backroom dealing between lobbyists is also the typical way statutes
themselves are created. Congress typically just ratifies what the
"stakeholders" (i.e. K Street lobbyists) hammered out. Usually the legislators
themselves reading little if any of the bill.  
  
Having been exposed to some of this process here in D.C., I'm now amazed by
how abstract and futile most political debate. The typical debate grossly
mischaracterizes the actual statutory language at issue. Now that we have the
Web, it would be nice if what has been standard for software engineers now
became standard for politics -- "read the source!"  
For example, the largest reforms to the patent laws since 1952 are in the
works and can be found here.  
  
James Madison, among other founders, thought that delegating too much rule-
making authority to the executive was unconstitutional. He and other founders
took part in any early debate on this topic which I describe in The Origins of
the Non-Delegation Doctrine.
