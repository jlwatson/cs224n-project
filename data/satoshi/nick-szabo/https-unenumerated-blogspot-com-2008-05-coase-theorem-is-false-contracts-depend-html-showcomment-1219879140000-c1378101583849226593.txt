Douglas, without a credible threat, whether to increase the sparks or simply
install a flamethrower, the extorter cannot profitably extort. This investment
in weaponry, whether the subtle weaponry of a negative externality or overt
weaponry, makes extortion a negative-sum game. The only way the extortion
could not be (in this already extremely abstract and imaginary world) negative
sum is if the extorter has a perfect weapon that cost him nothing, the victim
is absolutely defenseless, and the victim's output function is completely
inelastic, so that the victim works for the extorter just as hard as if the
victim rather than the extorter were earning the bulk of the surplus. Any of
these three assumptions are heady flights of the imagination.  
  
But then again, in the imaginary world of a Coase theorist even such important
phenomena as threats, security costs, arms races, and Laffer curves are mere
"transaction costs" that like many other crucially important matters can be
swept under that all-covering rug.
