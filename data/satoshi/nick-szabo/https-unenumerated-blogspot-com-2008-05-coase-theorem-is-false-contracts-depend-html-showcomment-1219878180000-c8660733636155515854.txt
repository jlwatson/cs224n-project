In response to Douglas Knight: the term "transaction costs" was coined by
analogy to a broker's fee: it is a cost one can decline to pay by declining to
enter into the transaction, with no direct negative costs (only possible
opportunity costs). OTOH coercion can be "an offer you can't refuse", or more
generally has negative utility on the coerced whether he declines it or not.
Coercion is a phase change, not a mere additive cost, and it is highly
confusing and misleading at best (I think it is just plain wrong) to bury it
under the rubric of "transaction costs", as if it was usefully analogous to a
broker's fee, and then proceed (as many users of the Coase theorem do) to
forget about its importance.  
  
Of course, if you define "transaction cost" as "any problem at all that might
arise that would render the Coase Theorem false", then the Coase theorem is
tautologically true: it is completely trivial and meaningless.
