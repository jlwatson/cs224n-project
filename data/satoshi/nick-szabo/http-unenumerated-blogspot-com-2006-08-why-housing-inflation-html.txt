houses less affordable in the U.S. than they've been for over a century?
Almost surely the answer is the recent rapid increase in zoning and code
regulations, driven by coalitions of homeowners under the aegis of Baby Boomer
environmentalist and smart growth ideology. Much of the extra costs go to
"architects" who must be paid to approve both new housing and additions, but
much also come from severe restrictions, for example on height, and from vast
areas of land simply being put off-limits to housing. The result is a large
benefit to homeowners who sell or get equity loans, but an even larger loss to
non-owners who would like to purchase, including millions of people stuck in
substandard or cramped housing and over a million outright homeless.  
  
This study, among many other studies and observations, shows a strong
correlation between local regulations and local housing prices. The
correlation between housing prices and other plausible variables, such as
density, is by contrast relatively weak. A reaction which purports to solve
the housing costs problem, while actually making it worse, is inclusionary
zoning, which more than tripled in California between 1990 and 2003.
