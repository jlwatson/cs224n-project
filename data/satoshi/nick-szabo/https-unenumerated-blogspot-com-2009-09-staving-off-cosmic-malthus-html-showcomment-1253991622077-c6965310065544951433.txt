Malthusian effects were entirely normal before the agricultural revolution
that accompanied the industrial revolution in Britain, and in the 3rd World
before the Green Revolution in the latter half of the 20th century. (A big h/t
to Norman Borlaug who recently passed, and to my dad who also worked on the
Green Revolution). Hanson and Sandberg are convincing that for current growth
rates in use of materials to continue exponentially for 10,000 years there has
to be vastly (far more than the mere improvement from atoms to photons I'm
talking about here) more room at the bottom, or no limits on velocity at the
top -- both of which violate currently known physics.  
  
Of course, one of my points here is that predicting the future of resources is
not so simple as counting things (whether it's barrels of known oil, in a
previous post, or even something seemingly so basic as atoms when were are
talking about the distant future).  
  
Other arguments (material use may or may not become an exponentially small
proportion of the value of our economy, Darwinian reproduction pressures may
or may not be indefinitely overcome, etc.) are needed to address the question
of whether per capital economic growth (i.e. value per capita) can continue
indefinitely.
