 _The singularity refers to the time in human history when computers first
pass the Turing test._  
  
That's one definition among many. And which Turing Test? There are an infinite
number of possible Turing tests, some of them easy, some of them hard. e.g.
The "captcha" test we go through to register for web sites, some versions of
which some computers can already pass. If the visual-letter captcha becomes
obsolete, it doesn't herald The Singularity, although it may play some hob
with computer security as we scramble to come up with a less spoofable
(probably because higher bandwidth, e.g. sound) variation on captcha.  
  
 _but we have an idea of what the world will be like in general._  
  
Really? Twenty years ago were you envisioning Facebook and the popularity of
texting among teens? What percentage of people in the early 1950s envisioned
life two decades later after the sexual revolution? How many people in the
1440s envisioned life in a society where most people were literate? Or as you
point out, the change from prelingual to lingual humans. Unexpected
qualitative changes have been happening for a very long time. They weren't
"singularities" in any meaningful sense of that term, they were qualitative,
complex changes that evolved over time. They were unpredictably unpredictable,
not predictably unpredictable.
