Top constitutional scholars and former high-level U.S. government officials
explain to Congress why by spying on domestic-overseas phone calls without
warrants, the U.S. National Security Agency is breaking the law. They observe
the Department of Justice letter "fail[ed] to to offer a plausible defense" of
the NSA's organized criminal activities. This is quite a statement -- in the
U.S. legal world, there is a plausible argument for almost any position. It
further demonstates that as I have observed the Justice Department has in a
very self-serving manner misled the President and is now misleading the
American people about what the law is. Look for the Justice Department to
mislead the Supreme Court on this issue in the future, as they have done with
other issues of executive power in the past, even before Ashcroft and Gonzales
headed that department which we are supposed to be able to trust with federal
law enforcement.
