Yet another idea: use the Bitcoin code to implement secure property titles.  
  
Secure title registries will be used to register ownership of names,
name/address bindings, bit gold (solution bits to proof-of-work challenges),
and anything else that can be represented as bits and whose ownership needs to
be securely agreed to across trust boundaries according to a securely agreed
and followed set of rules for claiming (homesteading), transfer, etc.  
  
There is a similar but more specialized project, namely Dot-Bit and namecoin,
to implement a secure DNS.
