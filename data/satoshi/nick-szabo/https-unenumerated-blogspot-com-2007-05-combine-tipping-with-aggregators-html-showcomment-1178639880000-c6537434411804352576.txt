Ian, I think people will sometimes look to the content ratings (as they do now
on digg), and people will sometimes look to the "who one is" signal (as they
do now at a restaraunt). It depends on the context. The reward for parting
with the funds is the "who one is" reputation as well as any of the other
social motivations people have to tip.  
  
I'm guessing from your comments, though, that you are skeptical of digg and
the like too?  
  
Reiner, I love your project and it's great to hear about the friends feature.
My best of wishes to your endeavor.
