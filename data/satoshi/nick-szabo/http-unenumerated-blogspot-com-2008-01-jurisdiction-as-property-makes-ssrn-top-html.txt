I'm happy to announce that my paper "Jurisdiction as Property" made the top 10
list for all time most dowloaded papers in legal history on the Social Science
Research Network, the standard site for posting scholarly legal papers here in
the U.S. Alas, the number of downloads is not quite as overwhelming as this
suggests -- academic interest in the crucially important area of legal history
is depressingly small -- but then again they are not counting the larger
number of downloads of the paper from my own web site. Here's my brief
description of the paper:  

> In medieval and renaissance England jurisdictions were often held as
property. Relationships between these jurisdictions were property relations.
The basic laws of jurisdiction were trespass and title. Infringement of a
jurisdiction was a trespass, and abuse of a defendant by a court could be a
trespass. In addition, the king could use his writ of right to challenge title
to a franchise. In determining title, a crucial idea was seisin, which for
franchises generally meant proper and continual use, and for jurisdictions in
particular came to mean the following of proper procedure. Defense of trespass
by and seisin of a franchise court came to imply obligations of protecting
individual rights and serving the public good as well as private gain. Thus
the property relations between franchises played a significant role in the
development of English jurisdictional and procedural law.
