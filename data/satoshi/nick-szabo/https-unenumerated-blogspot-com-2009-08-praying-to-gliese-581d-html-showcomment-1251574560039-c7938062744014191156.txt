BTW, it's not a matter of intuition, it's a matter of thinking carefully about
existential threats: not how many get killed, but how many survive, and how
they do so. Most peoples' intuition doesn't distinguish between major
disasters and existential threats. The confusion of harm and horror with
existential threat creates severe fallacies when people think about
existential threats.
