This is an example of an approach to smart contracts that uses the Stellar
model which keeps the bulk of the logic outside of the system so only people
that are interested need do any processing. This should make it more scalable.

I haven't thought through it yet but I think the most common case would
actually be 1 directional. Curious if people agree or have another opinion?
