[I'd delete this post if I could. It doesn't say much now. I had a post here
saying we weren't in a bubble but I had a mistake on my spreadsheet. It now
looks like we are. ]  
  
I would argue that BTC price is essentially determined by the number bitcoin
users there are. In order to be a bitcoin user you must hold bitcoins. This
means each additional bitcoin user creates demand. It is of course hard to
determine exactly how many bitcoin users there are so I'll assume it is
proportional to the number of forum users. (This isn't exactly true since the
number of forum accounts is strictly increasing but the userbase isn't
necessarily but I think since it is so new we can ignore this)  
Anyway this is a chart of (BTC Price*# of coins)/(# of forum users)  
  
  
  
  
(If someone has another metric to use other than forum membership I'd be glad
to plug that in also)
