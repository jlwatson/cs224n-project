creighto: Even if you are correct that there is some hidden pool of mining
waiting to be put online it doesn't change my original point that bitcoin as
it is now depends on everyone trusting a few random people. We are implicitly
trusting a couple large miners and a couple pools and your secret hasher.  
My argument is that we might as well make this trust explicit. It will be much
more efficient, and way more secure.
