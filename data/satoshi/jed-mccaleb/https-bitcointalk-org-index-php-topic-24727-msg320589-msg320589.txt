Gandlaf: I didn't say I was bored with mtgox. I said I didn't have enough time
to do it correctly. Kind of the opposite of bored.  
I've never faced legal action because of anything having to do with mtgox.
Baron was clearly lying since we have never heard from his lawyers.  
I haven't gotten any money from mtgox since the sale so there is no danger of
not being able to cover this loss.
