Yep really me.  
  
Yeah we are really excited to be out of the building stage. Stellar is in
really good shape technically now and it is time to get people to start using
it.  
  
The advisory board is there to bounce ideas off of, get feedback on strategy,
help with connections, and basically give advice  How often we talk to each
member really varies depending on what we are up to and what decisions we are
trying to make. For example when we were thinking of becoming an apache
project we spoke a lot to Greg Stein since he obviously knows the Apache
Foundation really well, etc.
