In Stellar it is possible for the issuer of an asset to set who can hold the
asset. So technically what you would do is just give permission to the set of
50 people you want to allow to hold shares in the company. They could buy and
sell among themselves freely but couldn't transfer the shares to anyone
outside of this set. You would need to set up something for authorizing people
to hold shares but you will have to do this regardless.
