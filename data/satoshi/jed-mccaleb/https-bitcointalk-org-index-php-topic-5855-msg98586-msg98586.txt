This depth channel is broadcasting the changes to the depth. It would be nice
if you could send something in the beginning to get the current depth table in
the same format. Then you can use this feed to change the original depth table
as time goes on.  
I know I can get it with the old API but it would be nice if the messages were
in the same format.  
Also is there a point to all these extra fields:
"op":"private","origin":"broadcast","private":"depth" ?
