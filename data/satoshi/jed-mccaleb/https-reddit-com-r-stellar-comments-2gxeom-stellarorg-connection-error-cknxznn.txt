Sorry everyone.
This all happened at an extremely bad time for us. Our ops guy is on paternity leave since he has a new two day old daughter. The majority of us are currently at a company offsite working on designing a big refactor/redesign of stellard. (ironically that would fix the issues that caused this network outage). We are still investigating but while we were sleeping the servers started crashing. In our morning the internet at our offsite location was out. We moved to a different location and I manged to log on and stabilized the network. But our internet continued to have issues and during that time, it looks like our cluster continued to have issues as well. We finally got the situation stabilized a few hours later. 
Sorry again, we are of course putting more redundancy in place to prevent such outages in the future and will post an update on everything next week.
