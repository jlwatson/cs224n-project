trippy: If you follow the thread you see that in bitcoin you don't need to
make 50% of the bitcoin users dishonest. There are maybe 3 people that need to
colude to break bitcoin or more likely 1 government.  
In this proposal you could pick 100 or 1000 random forum users and you would
be *way* safer. If you bothered to be more discriminating and actually picked
people you knew you would be even safer still.  
  
Also there isn't a way for someone to figure out who you have chosen to trust.
(Trust is the wrong word. These are people you don't think are working
together. You can actually choose all people taht you know are corrupt as long
as they aren't colluding)
