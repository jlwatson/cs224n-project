> you try and sell 100000 coins and the last 90k or so are essentially
worthless  
  
Not true. The daily volume is around 30k so just keep selling yours over 3 or
4 days for the lowest ask. The price will drop a little but not to nothing.
I'm sure you could drop 100k BTC for an average of $5 BTC over the course of a
few days.
