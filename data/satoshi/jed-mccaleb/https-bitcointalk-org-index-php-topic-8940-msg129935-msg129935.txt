I agree with Fleembit.  
  
This is what I said in another thread. But is more appropriate here:  
People had other ideas but you get the point. Something short and simple that
people can understand. Something that let's them clearly see why they should
use it regardless of their ideology.  
  
Gavin: I think your portrayal of it above is definitely better than the
forums. I still think it should be toned down. I feel like "revolutionizing
the financial system" is still too up in people's mix.  
  
I understand most people want that to happen but a) it isn't realistic b) it
scares people c) it antagonizes people that are powerful  
My point is if you want bitcoin to be as big as it can be and have the biggest
chance of "replacing banks" you should downplay this hope. Let them come to
you. There is no point in yelling this is a revolution. Just let the
revolution quietly happen.  
  
Also bitcoin can definitely succeed without doing all this revolution. It is
already useful and used.
