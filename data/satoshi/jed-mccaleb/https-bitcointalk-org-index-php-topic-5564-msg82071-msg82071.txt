imanikin: I get your point that dark pools seem like an unfair advantage to
bigger investors. But I would argue that the market has a very different
reaction to when a big investor places an order than to when a small one does.
For example, if a small investor places a bid for 50BTC above all the others
there will probably be 0 reaction. But if a big investor places a bid for
5000BTC above all the others the market definitely reacts. Specifically tons
of people jump in front of his order. Probably his order is never filled since
the price will just move above it.  
  
There is also the unfair fact that 1 big trader is more valuable to the market
than 1 small one since a big trader provides more liquidity. So an exchange
has more incentive to keep the big guys happy.  
  
I'm actually a bit curious what would happen if the order book wasn't shown at
all. I suppose it would make trading less interesting.
