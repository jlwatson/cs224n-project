The problem is the way bitcoin is presented. You guys all like it because you
are libertarian types. But keep in mind that the vast majority of people in
the world aren't. But bitcoin doesn't just appeal to libertarian types. All
you need to say to promote it is:  

 **Bitcoin is a free paypal that anyone can use.**

  
Please leave the libertarian, going to replace all other currencies, take over
the world stuff out of it. That just turns people off.  
The only important thing for people to know is that it is better than what
people use now for online payments.
