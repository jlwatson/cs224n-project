Stellar allows you to send and receive any type of currency. So it just means
allowing people to deposit and withdrawal via Stellar in addition to whatever
other deposit and withdrawal methods the exchange supports.  
  
For example now on Kraken you can send a Sepa payment to deposit Euros. They
could also accept Euros sent in via Stellar.
