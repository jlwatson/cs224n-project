Mike Hearn:  
A new person could run the client fine. You don't have to enter in anyone that
you trust to use it. You only need trust to resolve issues when there are two
competing ledgers. And that should be a very rare event.  
  
Yeah I know but that isn't actually how it turned out. Like I mention above we
actually are trusting the big miners and also trusting that some government or
corporation doesn't stick in X million of hashing power and compromise the
network. I feel like this system is actually more secure.  
  
I actually don't think it has different trade offs. Is there some other
advantage to the current bitcoin that I'm missing?
