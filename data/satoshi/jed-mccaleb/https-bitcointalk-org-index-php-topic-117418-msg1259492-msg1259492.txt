Hi I'm involved in a cryptocurrency related project and we are looking for a
talented graphic designer. Some UX experience is a plus.  
  
We aren't ready to release details of the project but it will be pretty
awesome.  
  
We are funded and based in the SF bay area. We strongly prefer someone local
but can make exceptions for the right person.  
please email jed ! open coin dot com if you are interested. Please send a link
to your portfolio.  
  
Here is the link to a prior post of us looking for another programmer if you
want to read that discussion: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=108782.0
