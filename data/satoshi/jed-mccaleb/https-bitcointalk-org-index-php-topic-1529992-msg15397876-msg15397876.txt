2 Billion or more lumens to be awarded to people building out the stellar
ecosystem.  
  
To encourage creativity and development in the Stellar ecosystem, were
announcing the Stellar Build Challenge.  
  
Stellar.org will grant awards in the following four categories: Anchors,
Applications, Exchanges, and First-Time Submissions. Well announce the first
round of winners on October 1, 2016.  
  
Build Challenge awards will be funded by unclaimed lumens from the bitcoin-
lumen program. This pilot challenge is simple by design: its an experiment to
find ways to develop services that are fair, affordable, and community-driven,
and at the same time drive uptake of the Stellar network to maximize
efficiency and reach. We plan to learn from it and offer similar programs in
the future.

Look forward to seeing what people build!
