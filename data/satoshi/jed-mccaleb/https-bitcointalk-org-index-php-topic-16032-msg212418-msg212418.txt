hazek: You are actually totally wrong about all your points. This volatility
has nothing to do with clipping the orders way outside of the normal price
range or darkpools.  
  
1) The market was this volatile or even more before darkpools and before I
clipped the order book.  
  
2) You can't see the complete orderbook for any currency pair. There are dark
pools for every currency pair. There is so much more hidden info for every
other currency pair on earth. Yet all have less volatility.  
  
3) The merchant problem is easily solved by not holding BTC like I explain
above.  
  
4) Multiple exchanges will only increase volatility since each market will be
thinner. The only thing that will decrease volatility is liquidity. It may
seem like there is a lot traded a day but it is really nothing compared to any
other currency pair.  
  
5) The recent crash had been building for days since the peak. It was
predicted by many people. It was greatly exacerbated by one person dumping a
ton of coins. If they had used a dark pool instead there wouldn't have been
such a huge drop. So actually use of the dark pool would have decreased
volatility.  
  
6) Look at this chart: http://mtgoxlive.com/orders <\- see all those straight
lines in price. Those are dark pool orders being hit. They are reducing
volatility as you can plainly see. If they weren't there there would be spikes
instead of straight lines.  
  
  
I should have used a different word for it other than "dark pool". I guess
"dark" scares people and they don't understand it. So when something
happens... "The market crashed. It must have been that evil dark pool that
confuses me!"
