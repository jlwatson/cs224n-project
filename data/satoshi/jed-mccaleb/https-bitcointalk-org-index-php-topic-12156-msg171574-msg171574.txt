There's an important point here which I have made which I'm not sure you have
understood: The details, at this point, are irrelevant. Bitcoin is the first
currency to solve the problem it solves. No other currencies of that nature
can possibly beat the enormous momentum that bitcoin has. No bitcoin
alternatives will survive for the same reason no alternative WWW protocols
will survive, or no alternative internet protocols will survive, or no
alternative set of microprocessor instructions will survive, etc., UNLESS they
solve a different problem than the problem solved by bitcoin.

  
oh just like how no social network could possibly overtake friendster.  
or no payment method could overtake paypal.  
I see your point.
