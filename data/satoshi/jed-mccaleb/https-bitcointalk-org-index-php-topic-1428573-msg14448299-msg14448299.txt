Stellar (XLM) is a completely decentralized consensus platform.  
It is designed to support any type of currency.  
It has a built in decentralized exchange that can be used to trade any type of
currency or asset.  
  
Features & Specifications  

  * 3-5 second confirmation time
  * Supports thousands of transactions per second
  * Can be used to send or trade any currency, asset, or token.
  * Open-source
  * Uses SCP rather than Proof of Work. Whitepaper
  * Simple, clean API
  * Multisig and smart contracts
  * Decentralized distributed database
  * 100B XLM created initially
  * 1% fixed annual inflation

  
Coin Distribution  
Since the Stellar network doesn't use mining, all the coins exist when the
network starts.  
The majority of these are held by the non-profit Stellar.org.  
Stellar.org is distributing the coins in the following way:  

  * 50B XLM: to be given in small increments to as many people as possible.
  * 25B XLM: to be given to other businesses and non-profits to reach people that stellar.org wouldn't otherwise be able to reach through the Direct Signup program.
  * 20B XLM: to be given to bitcoin and XRP holders (announcement about the details of this coming soon)
  * 5B XLM: retained by Stellar.org for operations.

More information about the coin distribution can be found here.  
You can see the distribution to date here.  
  
How it works  
Decentralized network  
A decentralized network consists of peers that can run independently of each
other.  

  

This means that the Stellar network does not depend on any single entity. The
idea is to have as many independent servers participate in the Stellar network
as possible, so that the network will still run successfully even if some
servers fail.  
  
Ledger  
Like a traditional ledger, the Stellar ledger records a list of all the
balances and transactions belonging to every single account on the network. A
complete copy of the global Stellar ledger is hosted on each server that runs
the Stellar software. Any entity can run a Stellar server.  
  
These servers form a decentralized Stellar network, allowing the ledger to be
distributed as widely as possible. The servers sync and validate the ledger by
a mechanism known as consensus.  
This entire process of coming to consensus on the Stellar network occurs
approximately every 2-5 seconds.  
Prof. David Mazières describes the technical process of consensus in his white
paper, The Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP). You can also explore other
resources explaining SCP.  
  
Anchors, trust, and credit  
Anchors are simply entities that people trust to hold their deposits and issue
credits into the Stellar network for those deposits. They act as a bridge
between different currencies and the Stellar network. All money transactions
in the Stellar network (except the native digital currency of lumens) occur in
the form of credit issued by anchors.  
Anchors do two simple things:  
1) They take your deposit and issue the corresponding credit to your account
address on the Stellar ledger.  
2) You can make a withdrawal by bringing them credit they issued.  
You have to trust the anchor to honor your deposits and withdrawals of credit
it has issued.  
Anchors exist in the pre-stellar world now. For example, to use Venmo, you
deposit money in from your bank account. Venmo then gives you credit in your
Venmo account. You can now send that Venmo credit to anyone that trusts Venmo
(anyone with a Venmo account). Someone that received your Venmo credit can
convert it to real money by withdrawing it to their bank.  
Anchors perform the same function in Stellar. The difference is, all the
"Venmos and other anchors are operating on the same network so they can all
transact with each other now  this makes the system way more powerful. People
can now easily send and exchange all these different anchor credits with each
other.  
  
  
Distributed Exchange  
The Stellar ledger is able to store offers that people have made to buy or
sell currencies. Offers are public commitments to exchange one type of credit
for another at a predetermined rate. The ledger becomes a global marketplace
for assets.  
All these offers form what is called an orderbook. There is an orderbook for
each currency/issuer pair. So if you are wanting to exchange Virgin Bank/EUR
for bitstamp/BTC you look at that particular order book in the ledger to see
what people are buying and selling it for.  
This allows people to not only buy and sell currencies in a foreign exchange
like manner but also to convert currencies seamlessly during transactions.  
  
Multi-currency transactions  

  

Stellar allows you to send any currency you hold to anyone else in a different
currency through the built-in distributed exchange. People can receive any
currency through an anchor they added.  
For example, Amy wants to send Bob euros, using her BTC balance. Stellar will
automatically convert her BTC to EUR. The network will find the best exchange
rate for the transaction.  
  
Stellar Development Foundation  
Stellar.org (Stellar Development Foundation) is a nonprofit organization that
contributes to the Stellar networks development and ensures it remains open
and accessible to everyone.  
Our mission is to connect people to low-cost financial services to fight
poverty. We envision a prosperous world where everyone can improve their own
lives through access to affordable payments, credit, and savings accounts.
