Mike Hearn:  
If you want to become a merchant yes you should enter in some nodes that you
trust. If you are just a random person checking out the software then there is
some bootstrapping process (like there is for bitcoin) that gets you connected
to the network. At that point everyone you connect to will tell you the hash
of the current ledger. If you notice a discrepancy then yes you will have to
jump through some hoops. Come to the forum and ask for a list of trusted nodes
or something. But again this level of trust is very low. You could pick 100
random forum users and be fine.  
  
You don't have to trust a particular miner but you do have to trust that
artforz and deepbit aren't conspiring. Which is analogous to having to trust
that more than 50 of the random forum users you picked to trust aren't working
together.  
  
kjj: I don't think so. You can steal the vast majority of blocks from then on
by storing up blocks you generate and release them only when someone else also
solves one. Not sure if you consider that meaningful or not. (There was some
long ago thread about this that I can't find now) You could double spend by
getting one block ahead of the good network and then just stay ahead until you
are ready to drop your one block longer chain.
