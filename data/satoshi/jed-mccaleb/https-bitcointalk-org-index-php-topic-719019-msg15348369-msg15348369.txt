It doesn't even have to do that.  
Stellar is perfect for remittances.  
The majority of remittance traffic through stellar will use lumens as the
bridge currency since it is much easier. So the market makers will have to
maintain some float in lumens.  
Let's assume we gain some traction in Nigeria.  
There are ~$21B in remittances sent to Nigeria every year.  
If you are interested in the potential price, you should calculate how much
that float would mean the lumen price would have to be. That is one country
and it is the floor and doesn't include the mark up for speculation.
