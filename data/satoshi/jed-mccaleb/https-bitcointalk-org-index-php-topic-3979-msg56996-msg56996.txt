I get the impression that many people think that price of BTC is somehow
influenced by difficulty.  
I actually I don't agree that difficulty going up will increase the value of
coins.  
The only thing that will increase the value of coins is more actual users.  
Miners don't really increase the value of BTC. And difficulty going up just
means there are more miners.  
It is a misconception is that difficulty drives price. Price is as always
determined by supply and demand.  
And difficulty doesn't effect the supply of coins since the rate of new coins
is unrelated to the difficulty. So it isn't a factor in price  
  
But as price changes difficulty does change. Since as price goes up it
attracts more miners.  
  
Price determines difficulty. Not the other way around.
