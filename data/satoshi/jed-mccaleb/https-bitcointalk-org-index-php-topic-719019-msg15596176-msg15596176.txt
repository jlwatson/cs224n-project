M28MmickT: If I don't think that XRP is going to be worth much long term why
do you think I should be obligated to hold on to it? I didn't start selling
right when I left ripple (when I was the most angry) I gave them a year to see
if things would look better but to me it still seemed like the company
wouldn't last long term so it was time to sell. Of course it is impossible for
me to be totally objective but I was trying to make a rational choice. But I
really don't think it was emotionally driven decision which is what I think
you are implying when you say it was childish.  
  
We have done several auctions of lumens which is similar to a crowdsale. SDF
is currently selling some of its lumens on kraken right now to pay for our
operations. So anyone can go be an early adopter, get lumens and help SDF.  
  
>And for the end, don't look for someone to build apps on your platform  
This isn't our platform. This is owned by the world. It will be built by you
guys. It is all open source and an open protocol much like bitcoin. If Stellar
is going to work other people need to get involved. I think there are a lot of
people out there that are dissatisfied with how money and payments work and
Stellar can greatly improve things and democratize/decentralize these
concentrations of power. This technology can be very liberating and empowering
but it does take a community of people to contribute to it.
