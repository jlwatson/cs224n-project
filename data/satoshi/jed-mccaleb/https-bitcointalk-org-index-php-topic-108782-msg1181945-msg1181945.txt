Hi I'm involved in a cryptocurrency related project and we are looking for
someone that can work magic with javascript and jQuery.  
We are also hiring an experienced C++ developer.  
  
We aren't ready to release details of the project but it is very exciting.  
  
We are funded and based in the SF bay area. We strongly prefer people local
but can make exceptions for the right person.  
please email jed ! open coin dot com if you are interested. Please send links
to things you have done preferably outside of work/school.
