Dear Mt. Gox users,  
  
We are pleased to announce that as a way to say we sincerely appreciate our
customers who are hanging in there with us as we recover from the
hackcrash (not to mention our growing pains), we will be extending the
current discounted trade fees.  
  
Those who are trading at 0% will continue at that rate until July 27. After
the July 27 customers with the 0% trade fees will migrate to 0.3% trade fees
which they will be able to take advantage of until August 9.  
  
Those who were trading at 0.3% will continue at the same rate until August 9  
  
We would also like to remind those users who are trading at 0% that they are
eligible for a free YubiKey, a new One Time Password security feature at
Mt.Gox that will ensure the security of your online transactions with us.
Unfortunately, we will only be able to offer this for a short time so please
make sure to order your key at http://Yubikey.mtgox.com (be sure to login)
before July 27.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
-Mt. Gox Team.
