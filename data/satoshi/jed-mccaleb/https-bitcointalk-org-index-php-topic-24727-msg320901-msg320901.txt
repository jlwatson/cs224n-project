Gandlaf: No that isn't my statement. You seem to really want to misconstrue
what you read. My statement is this:  
MtGox has enough funds to cover any losses from the recently stolen coins and
has enough to cover what it owes me to date.  
MtGox will cover any debt to its customers before it pays me.  
The fact that I haven't been paid yet has nothing to do with mtgox's ability
to pay. It only has to do with the fact that neither I nor Mark have made time
to complete the payment.
