Tons of improvements.  
Safer with a solid consensus mechanism:

Much more scalable.  
Much easier to develop against as it uses a normal SQL DB to store state and
the API is very good now.  
Now has multisig and smart contract features:

I'd make your decision based on looking at the code and the paper and how the
system works rather than from rumors and innuendo spread about me.
