You're all not listening to what I'm saying. I am sorry this happened,

How can you say you are sorry? You didn't do *anything* to help the situation.
You 3 are either complete lying thieves or incredibly stupid. We offered to
take over bitcoinica and pay everyone back 100% of their claims but instead
you assholes twiddled your thumbs, hid and allowed even *more* money to be
stolen and now it is all going to be pissed away in receivership. All you had
to do was simply give control back to tihan but that was too much trouble for
you worthless...
