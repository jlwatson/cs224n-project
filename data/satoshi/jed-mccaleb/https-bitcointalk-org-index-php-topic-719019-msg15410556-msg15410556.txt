ashapasa: Things are going really well in Nigeria. We should have some news
from there in the next month. The thing about stellar is that you can use any
type of currency in the network. So most people will just use their local
currency so they aren't issues of currency volatility. People in Nigeria using
stellar will be sending around Niara not lumens.  
I agree speculation should be left to the people that can afford to do it.
