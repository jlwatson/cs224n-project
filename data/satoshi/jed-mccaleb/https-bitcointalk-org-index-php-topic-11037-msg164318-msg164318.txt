yeah this happens with stock all the time people don't get confused. Best make
the change now. Prices will always be quoted in whatever we call the smaller
denomination. Might as well make that thing be bitcoin. It will be more
confusing if there is this extra UBC thing floating around. People will
constantly ask "well what is a bitcoin then?" "oh that isn't used anymore"
huh?
