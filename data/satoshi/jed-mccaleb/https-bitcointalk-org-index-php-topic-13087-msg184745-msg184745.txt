There are already a bunch of other threads about this.  
To me the best solution by far is to just change what we mean when we say
bitcoin.  
so 1 BTC now = 1,000,000.00 BTC or whatever in the new client.  
  
UBC is the second best option but it seems bad to lose the bitcoin name.  
  
A good side effect is now people won't ask "But there are only 21 million
bitcoins. how can that work?"
