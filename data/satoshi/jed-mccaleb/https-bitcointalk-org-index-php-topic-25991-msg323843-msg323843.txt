toddbethell: Wouldn't a lower price attract more investment? It the price goes
to 10 there is clearly potential for 3x upside. 3x upside isn't that clear
when the price is 30.  
  
YoYa: you can't seriously trade on a market with a 1/10th the liquidity of the
main market. You are just throwing money away if you do.
