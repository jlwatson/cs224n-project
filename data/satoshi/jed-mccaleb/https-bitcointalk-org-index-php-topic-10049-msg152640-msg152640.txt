I would favor something different : when the decimal place is moved in the
default implementation we just call "a bitcoin" whatever happens to be the
smallest integer value after the decimal shift.  
  
Happened in France the other way around when we switched from "old francs" to
"new francs" with a "new franc" being worth exactly 100 "old" ones.  
  
After a couple of weeks of slight confusion, everything would be back in order

  
Yeah this is the best idea I think. No real need to make up a new name. Just
change the display in the client.
