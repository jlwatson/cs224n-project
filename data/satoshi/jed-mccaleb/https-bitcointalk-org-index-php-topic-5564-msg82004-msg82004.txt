imanikin: can you point to the threads explaining what you don't like about
the DP?  
  
The DP definitely reduces volatility. It is hard to buy a sell a lot of BTC
otherwise.  
  
The only other complaint I've heard about it is that it makes it hard for
speculators to know how much they will move the market with an order. But the
only reason to worry about this is if you want to do tricky things like dump a
bunch of BTC to lower the price and then buy it back plus some. But I'm not
sure this is such a bad thing.  
  
I tend to think it is fine how it is but the limit should be raised so it is
really just very large orders.
