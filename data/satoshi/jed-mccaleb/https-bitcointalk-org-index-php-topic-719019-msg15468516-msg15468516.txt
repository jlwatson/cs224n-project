Soul_eater_123: Sorry I didn't mean to come off as being coy. My point is that
the price is just supply and demand. It isn't what people pay for the good in
the first place that matters.  
Clearly giving away a bunch of lumens increases the supply but the hope is
that it also increases awareness and the number of people interested in the
project which will increase demand.  
  
As far as mtgox, I sold it to mark who proceeded to screw it up. I definitely
regret not finding someone more competent to take it over.  
As far as ripple, I announced my intention to sell *before* I sold. This
seemed like the most honorable thing to do. I could have sold without telling
anyone and made way more money. Not sure what people would have preferred I
did?  
  
> The timing is the main problem it is now 2 years since launch.  
Yeah ideally we would have been giving out the lumens at a steady rate since
we launched. We started doing that when we launched 2 years ago, but
unfortunately the ripple codebase wasn't up to handling the scale so we had to
pause the giveaway while we rewrote everything. Now that that is done and the
code is solid we can start the giveaway again.
