I think you aren't exactly understanding the proposal.  
You have a list of nodes that you trust. These guys are the only ones who's
vote you listen to. The idea is that if there are enough people you trust
online it can't be compromised. A good amount of nodes you trust will be
online at any given time. So they will see first hand if transactions should
be added to the ledger or not. You are not relying on who they are trusting in
turn if that is what your issue is.  
  
People publish their node's public key you can add it to your client if you
want. There are enough people even on this forum I would add. Keep in mind
that you don't really have to _trust_ them. You just have to trust that  >50%
of them wont be working together for some nefarious purpose.  
  
This scenario wouldn't be two competing ledgers it would be a ledger that is
trusted by 99% of the legit nodes and a ledger held by a million fake nodes
that no one trusts. You aren't the only one that wouldn't believe their BS
ledger. No one legit would. So they aren't really a "part of the network."  
  
It is the same thing going on right now with bitcoin we are all implicitly
saying we trust deepbit, artforz etc.  
In the new system you would just add them to the your list of trusted nodes if
you wanted.  
  
If you still don't see how it would work could you please describe a specific
attack that would compromise it?

Yeah I have a method but I want to make sure there are no holes in this first.
