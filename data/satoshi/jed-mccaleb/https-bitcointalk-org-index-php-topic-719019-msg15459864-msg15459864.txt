Jdj1727: "So, just so I understand...On July 4th, 3 billion more STR/XLM will
be hitting BTC wallets/exchanges?"  
No July 5th is when we are starting the lumen giveaway to bitcoin holders. The
lumens go out as people claim them. We will see how many people claim them and
how long it takes but it will be at the very least over the course of weeks.  
  
electronicash: "is there really something laid for STR holders?"  
Yeah tons of things going on. Check out blog for the latest updates:

M28MmickT: Stellar has no mining so it isn't really a premine. The currency
all exists when the network starts. Details about how the lumens will be
distributed are here: https://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/  
> "You should give away at least 80% of your coins if you want this project to
have real success."  
we are giving away 95% of the lumens so I agree with you.
