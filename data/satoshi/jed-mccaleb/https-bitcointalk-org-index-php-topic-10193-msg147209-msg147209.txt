kjj:  
So let's assume an attacker controls 60% of the network.  
He makes a big transaction that is sent to the whole network.  
He stops generating blocks on the legit network.  
He now starts generating a new chain without the large transaction but not
sending it to the rest of the network.  
His fake chain will eventually grow longer than the real chain.  
At some point of his choosing he publishes his longer chain to the real
network.  
The fake chain is now accepted as real since it is longer.

Since this topic keeps coming up over and over again, I'm going to propose a
potential solution: every time a node reshuffles, they should make a note of
which peer it came from. More than three reshuffles from the same peer in like
24 hours, and that node is dropped.

This doesn't help. It is trivial to just send from a new peer.
