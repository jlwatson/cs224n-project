Bitcoin is a peer to peer protocol used to exchange scarce cryptographic
tokens called bitcoins, which can be used as money.

  
But people don't care how things work. They just want them to work. (This is
still lightyears better than mentioning how it will take out banks though)

Bitcoins are super-convenient barter tokens for the internet

  
This is better since it speaks more to function.  
  
But I still think saying how it is an improvement over something people are
already familiar with (like paypal) is better. Even if the comparison isn't
the complete story. The above quote will make most people think, "What do I
need barter tokens for?"
