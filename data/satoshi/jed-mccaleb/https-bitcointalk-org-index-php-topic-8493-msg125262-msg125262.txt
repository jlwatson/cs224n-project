  
But people don't care how things work. They just want them to work. (This is
still lightyears better than mentioning how it will take out banks though)  
  
  
This is better since it speaks more to function.  
  
But I still think saying how it is an improvement over something people are
already familiar with (like paypal) is better. Even if the comparison isn't
the complete story. The above quote will make most people think, "What do I
need barter tokens for?"
