Of course, if you buy BTC as a currency instead of a speculative vehicle none
of this matters much. Instead of sell, sell, sell, try spending your bitcoin.
It will help make a more robust economy and you may find some bargains right
now priced in bitcoin.

  
Exactly!  
  
Either you are actually using bitcoins and you don't care what the price is or
you are speculating and then these crazy swings are just what you want.
