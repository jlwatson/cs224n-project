It is neither negligence nor fraud but an apology on reddit isn't all that we are doing. Like I said we are trying to get poloniex to do it. But the blocker here isn't us. The ball is in their court, it is up to them if they want to do the distribution to you guys. So if you want to be productive I'd urge them to participate.
