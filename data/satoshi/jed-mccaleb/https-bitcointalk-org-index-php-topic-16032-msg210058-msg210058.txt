Bitcoin is going to be highly volatile for a long time no mater what exchage
is used. The way for merchants to accept bitcoin is to give the customer their

receiving the BTC. This way the merchant has no exposure to BTC rate changes.  
Mtgox is working on something to make this process easy.  
  
The clipping of the depth chart was a hack I threw in there to make the graph

rolled out.
