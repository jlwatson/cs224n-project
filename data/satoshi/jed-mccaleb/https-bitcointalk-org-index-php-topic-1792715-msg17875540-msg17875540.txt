There was a thread on twitter
(https://twitter.com/taoeffect/status/832041974735654912) debating this
question and I wanted to move it here since discussions on twitter usually
aren't that productive.  
  
In my view Stellar is definitely permission-less. Anyone can run a validator.
You don't need permission from anyone to join or use the network.  
  
Greg, in the case that you are concerned with that there could be some
"cartel" of validators that are all listening to each other and no one else,
it is trivial for people to set up their own validators outside this cartel
and listen to each other.  
  
Keep in mind that this can also easily happen in bitcoin, if a cartel of
miners with over 51% of the hashing decide to stop accepting blocks from
people outside of cartel they can do this. The difference is in bitcoin it
would be hard to ignore the cartel and there is economic incentive for the
cartel to take all the blocks.
