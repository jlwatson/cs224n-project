I'm not saying there's no place for a trust network, either in place of mining
or in addition to it (maybe "I trust these nodes would never engage in an
attack on the network"), but I think it's important to keep in mind that the
future will most likely look nothing like the present.

  
I would argue that it will be even more consolidated. There will just be a few
large mining operations and some big pools. This makes the issue of trust even
worse.

Bitcoin is not wasteful, even now. It's several orders of magnitude more
energy efficient than the fiat currency systems in use around the world.

Just because it is less wasteful than another wasteful thing doesn't make it
not wasteful. You are basically saying: "The model-T is much faster than the
horse. There can't be anything faster!"
