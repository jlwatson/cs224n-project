Hello everyone, MagicalTux is busy getting everything back in order on mtgox
so he asked me to post here and answer any questions people have.  
  
First, only a small amount of BTC was stolen. MtGox will refund the stolen BTC
to the compromised user.  
  
 **Everyone's bitcoins are safe on the site. We still are holding all the
coins safely in reserve. The vast majority of the coins are stored offline so
they are impossible to compromise.**  
  
He understands the rollback won't be popular with people who were able to pick
up coins for .10 or whatever but none of those trades were legitimate so mtgox
has a legal obligation to reverse the trades.  
  
I'm sure when you think about it you don't actually want to buy stolen coins
and take advantage of the situation.  
  
Things have been very hectic with mtgox since MagicalTux took over. He has
simultaneously been trying to fend off persistent ddos attacks, hire more
staff, deal with the huge increase in users, improve the code to support the
much larger trade volume, ensure regulatory compliance and deal with various
security issues. Obviously things haven't gone as smoothly as we would like
but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel with more people being hired
and the backend changes done. MtGox will hopefully be able to regain your
trust in the coming weeks.  
  
The site should be up again shortly. I'm asking him to clear all the standing
orders.  
  
Please post any questions you have here and I'll do my best to answer.
