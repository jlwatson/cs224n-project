I never understand this deflationary argument people give. I think it only
applies to national currencies not something like bitcoin. Let me see if I
have your argument straight:  
1) bitcoin is deflationary so bitcoins will exchange for more and more dollars
as time goes on.  
2) This means that bitcoins are worthless  
  
huh? which is it? are they going to be worth a lot or worth a little?
