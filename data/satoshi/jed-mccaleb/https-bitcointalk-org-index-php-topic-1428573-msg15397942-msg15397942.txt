HarrKPeters: We are doing something like you suggest now: **2B+ lumens will be
awarded to projects built on Stellar** more info here:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1529992.new#new  
and here: https://www.stellar.org/blog/build-challenge/  
  
Emerger: We are limited on how we can do it by US regulations. We have to
ensure that we are not giving lumens to people on the US sanctions list. So we
need some way of verifying who they are.  
  
Crypto*Digger: yes the distributed exchange is working but it depends on 3rd
parties to become what we call anchors to put other currencies into the
network.
