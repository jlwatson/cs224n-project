unk: there are a lot of people that have withdrawn this much from mtgox. Ask
the big miners if you want someone other than me to confirm that.  
  
I'd say the reason for the price rise is pretty simple; a lot more people into
bitcoin and a lot easier ways to get money into mtgox. So I think it is only a
bubble if the userbase is a bubble.
