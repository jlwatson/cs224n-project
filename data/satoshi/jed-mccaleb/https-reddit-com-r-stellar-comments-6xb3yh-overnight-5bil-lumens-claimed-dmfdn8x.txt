It wasn't a claim. if you look here https://dashboard.stellar.org/ - you can see how many lumens were distributed in the bitcoin program.  The "other" slice includes: lumens SDF has auctioned off to pay for operations, lumens employees have vested, lumens sold directly to other companies or individuals, lumens granted/loaned/escrowed in partnerships with other companies.  So the "other" slice is a combination of those things.
