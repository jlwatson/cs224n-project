I know it is frustrating. It was a misunderstanding between Poloniex and ourselves. We are talking to them and trying to get them to support the distribution still.

But regardless where we are now is that if you are a polo user and want the distribution to happen please contact polo and ask them to support it. We are allowing them to give free lumens to all their users but it is up to them to actually do it. We can't do it for them.
Thanks,
Jed.
